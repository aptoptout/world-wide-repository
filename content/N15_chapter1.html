I think what he did have was the <a href="/wiki/Atypical_pneumonia" title="Atypical pneumonia">walking pneumonia</a>.&apos; [...] On top of that, &apos;He was saying all the time, &apos;dammit, I can&apos;t sleep&apos;... and he was taking all these pills to help him.&apos;&#xA0;&quot;</p><p>In talking with <i><a href="/wiki/Interview_(magazine)" title="Interview (magazine)">Interview</a></i> magazine, after his death, Ledger&apos;s former fianc&#xE9;e <a href="/wiki/Michelle_Williams_(actress)" title="Michelle Williams (actress)">Michelle Williams</a> also confirmed reports the actor had experienced trouble sleeping. &quot;For as long as I&apos;d known him, he had bouts with insomnia. He had too much energy. His mind was turning, turning, turning &#x2013; always turning.&quot;</p><p>At about 2:45&#xA0;pm (<a href="/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone" title="Eastern Time Zone">EST</a>), on 22 January 2008, Ledger was found unconscious in his bed by his <a href="/wiki/Housekeeper_(domestic_worker)" title="Housekeeper (domestic worker)">housekeeper</a>, Teresa Solomon, and his <a href="/wiki/Massage" title="Massage">masseuse</a>, Diana Wolozin, in his fourth-floor loft apartment at 421 Broome Street in the <a href="/wiki/SoHo" class="mw-redirect" title="SoHo">SoHo</a> neighbourhood of <a href="/wiki/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>.</p><p>According to the police, Wolozin, who had arrived early for a 3:00 pm appointment with Ledger, called Ledger&apos;s friend <a href="/wiki/Mary-Kate_Olsen" title="Mary-Kate Olsen">Mary-Kate Olsen</a> for help. Olsen, who was in <a href="/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>, directed a New York City private security guard to go to the scene. At 3:26 pm, &quot;less than 15 minutes after she first saw him in bed and only a few moments after the first call to Ms. Olsen&quot;, Wolozin telephoned <a href="/wiki/9-1-1" title="9-1-1">9-1-1</a> &quot;to say that Mr. Ledger was not breathing&quot;. At the urging of the 9-1-1 operator, Wolozin administered <a href="/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation" title="Cardiopulmonary resuscitation">CPR</a>, which was unsuccessful in reviving him.</p><p>Paramedics and emergency medical technicians arrived seven minutes later, at 3:33 pm (&quot;at almost exactly the same moment as a private security guard summoned by Ms. Olsen&quot;) but were also unable to revive him. At 3:36 pm, Ledger was pronounced dead, and his body was removed from the apartment.</p><p>Two weeks later on 6 February 2008, the <a href="/wiki/Coroner" title="Coroner">Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York</a> released its conclusions, based on an initial <a href="/wiki/Autopsy" title="Autopsy">autopsy</a> of 23 January 2008 and a subsequent complete <a href="/wiki/Toxicology" title="Toxicology">toxicological analysis</a>. The report concludes, in part, &quot;Mr. Heath Ledger died as the result of acute intoxication by the combined effects of <a href="/wiki/Oxycodone" title="Oxycodone">oxycodone</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hydrocodone" title="Hydrocodone">hydrocodone</a>, <a href="/wiki/Diazepam" title="Diazepam">diazepam</a>, <a href="/wiki/Temazepam" title="Temazepam">temazepam</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alprazolam" title="Alprazolam">alprazolam</a> and <a href="/wiki/Doxylamine" title="Doxylamine">doxylamine</a>.&quot; It states definitively: &quot;We have concluded that the manner of death is accident, resulting from the abuse of prescribed medications.&quot;</p><p>While the medications found in the toxicological analysis may be prescribed in the United States for <a href="/wiki/Insomnia" title="Insomnia">insomnia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Anxiety" title="Anxiety">anxiety</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pain" title="Pain">pain</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Common_cold" title="Common cold">common cold</a> (doxylamine) symptoms, the vast majority of physicians in the US are extremely reluctant to prescribe multiple <a href="/wiki/Benzodiazepine" title="Benzodiazepine">benzodiazepines</a> (e.g., diazepam, alprazolam, and temazepam) to a single patient, let alone prescribe the same to a patient already taking a mix of oxycodone and hydrocodone. Although the <a href="/wiki/Associated_Press" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> and other media reported that &quot;police estimate Ledger&apos;s time of death between 1 pm and 2:45 pm&quot; (on 22 January 2008), the Medical Examiner&apos;s Office announced that it would not be publicly disclosing the official estimated time of death. The official announcement of the cause and manner of Ledger&apos;s death heightened concerns about the growing problems of <a href="/wiki/Prescription_drug_abuse" class="mw-redirect" title="Prescription drug abuse">prescription drug abuse</a> or misuse and <a href="/wiki/Combined_drug_intoxication" title="Combined drug intoxication">combined drug intoxication</a> (CDI).</p><p>Late in February 2008, a <a href="/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration" title="Drug Enforcement Administration">DEA</a> investigation of medical professionals relating to Ledger&apos;s death exonerated two American physicians, who practice in Los Angeles and <a href="/wiki/Houston" title="Houston">Houston</a>, of any wrongdoing, determining that &quot;the doctors in question had prescribed Ledger other medications &#x2013; not the pills that killed him.&quot;</p><p>On 4 August 2008, citing unnamed sources, Murray Weiss, of the <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_Post" title="New York Post">New York Post</a></i>, first reported that <a href="/wiki/Mary-Kate_Olsen" title="Mary-Kate Olsen">Mary-Kate Olsen</a> had &quot;refused [through her attorney, Michael C.

[without] ... <a href="/wiki/Immunity_from_prosecution" class="mw-redirect" title="Immunity from prosecution">immunity</a> from prosecution&quot; and that, when asked about the matter, Miller at first declined further comment. Later that day, after the police confirmed the gist of Weiss&apos;s account to the <a href="/wiki/Associated_Press" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a>, Miller issued a statement denying that Olsen supplied Ledger with the drugs causing his death and asserting that she did not know their source. In his statement, Miller said specifically, &quot;Despite tabloid speculation, Mary-Kate Olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in Heath Ledger&apos;s home or his body, and she does not know where he obtained them,&quot; emphasising that media &quot;descriptions [attributed to an unidentified source] are incomplete and inaccurate.&quot;</p><p>After a flurry of further media speculation, on 6 August 2008, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_New_York" title="United States District Court for the Southern District of New York">US Attorney&apos;s Office</a> in Manhattan closed its investigation into Ledger&apos;s death without filing any charges and rendering <a href="/wiki/Mootness" title="Mootness">moot</a> its <a href="/wiki/Subpoena" title="Subpoena">subpoena</a> of Olsen. With the clearing of the two doctors and Olsen, and the closing of the investigation because the prosecutors in the Manhattan US Attorney&apos;s Office &quot;don&apos;t believe there&apos;s a viable target,&quot; it is still not known how Ledger obtained the oxycodone and hydrocodone in the <a href="/wiki/Combined_drug_intoxication" title="Combined drug intoxication">lethal drug combination</a> that killed him.</p><p>Eleven months after Ledger&apos;s death, on 23 December 2008, Jake Coyle, writing for the Associated Press, announced that &quot;Heath Ledger&apos;s death was voted 2008&apos;s top entertainment story by U.S. newspaper and broadcast editors surveyed by The Associated Press&quot; because it resulted in &quot;shock and confusion&quot; about &quot;the circumstances&quot;, the ruling of the death as an accident caused by &quot;a toxic combination of prescription drugs&quot;, and the continuation of &quot;his legacy...

Both actors were 28 at the time of death. Both died during production of movies (Lee in <a href="/wiki/The_Crow_(1994_film)" title="The Crow (1994 film)">The Crow</a> and Ledger in <a href="/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_(film)" title="The Dark Knight (film)">The Dark Knight</a>) in which they were playing disturbed comic book characters. And both of their characters had a very similar, creepy, look and make-up in the movies: whiteface, dark eye sockets, and an evil-clown extended smile.</p><p>After Ledger&apos;s death, in response to some press reports about his <a href="/wiki/Will_(law)" class="mw-redirect" title="Will (law)">will</a>, filed in New York City on 28 February 2008, and his daughter&apos;s access to his financial legacy, his father, Kim Ledger, said that he considered the financial well-being of his granddaughter Matilda Rose the Ledger family&apos;s &quot;absolute priority&quot; and her mother, <a href="/wiki/Michelle_Williams_(actress)" title="Michelle Williams (actress)">Michelle Williams</a>, &quot;an integral part of our family&quot;, adding &quot;They will be taken care of and that&apos;s how Heath would want it to be&quot;. Some of Ledger&apos;s relatives may be challenging the legal status of his will signed in 2003, prior to his involvement with Williams and the birth of their daughter and not updated to include them, which divides half of his <a href="/wiki/Estate_(law)" title="Estate (law)">estate</a> between his parents and half among his siblings; they claim that there is a second, unsigned will, which leaves most of that estate to Matilda Rose. Williams&apos; father, Larry Williams, has also joined the controversy about Ledger&apos;s will as it was filed in New York City soon after his death.</p><p>On 31 March 2008, stimulating another controversy pertaining to Ledger&apos;s estate, Gemma Jones and Janet Fife-Yeomans published an &quot;Exclusive&quot; report, in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph_(Australia)" title="The Daily Telegraph (Australia)">The Daily Telegraph</a></i>, citing Ledger&apos;s uncle Haydn Ledger and other family members, who &quot;believe the late actor may have fathered a secret love child&quot; when he was 17, and stating that &quot;If it is confirmed that Ledger is the girl&apos;s biological father, it could split his multi-million dollar estate between ... Matilda Rose ... and his secret love child.&quot; A few days later, reports citing telephone interviews with Ledger&apos;s uncles Haydn and Mike Ledger and the family of the other little girl, published in <i><a href="/wiki/OK!" title="OK!">OK!</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Us_Weekly" title="Us Weekly">Us Weekly</a></i>, &quot;denied&quot; those &quot;claims&quot;, with Ledger&apos;s uncles and the little girl&apos;s mother and stepfather describing them as unfounded &quot;rumors&quot; distorted and exaggerated by the media.</p><p>On 15 July 2008, Fife-Yeomans reported further, via Australian <i><a href="/wiki/News_Limited" class="mw-redirect" title="News Limited">News Limited</a>,</i> that &quot;While Ledger left everything to his parents and three sisters, it is understood they have legal advice that under Western Australia law, Matilda Rose is entitled to the <a href="/wiki/Lion%27s_share" title="Lion&apos;s share">lion&apos;s share</a>&quot; of his estate; its <a href="/wiki/Executor" title="Executor">executors</a>, Kim Ledger&apos;s former business colleague Robert John Collins and <a href="/wiki/Geraldton" title="Geraldton">Geraldton</a> accountant William Mark Dyson, &quot;have applied for <a href="/wiki/Probate" title="Probate">probate</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Western_Australia" title="Supreme Court of Western Australia">West Australian Supreme Court</a> in <a href="/wiki/Perth" title="Perth">Perth</a>, advertising for &apos;<a href="/wiki/Creditor" title="Creditor">creditors</a> and other persons&apos; having claims on the estate to lodge them by 11 August 2008 ... to ensure all debts are paid before the estate is distributed....&quot; According to this report by Fife-Yeomans, earlier reports citing Ledger&apos;s uncles, and subsequent reports citing Ledger&apos;s father, which do not include his actual posthumous earnings, &quot;his entire fortune, mostly held in Australian trusts, is likely to be worth up to <a href="/wiki/Australian_dollar" title="Australian dollar">$</a>20&#xA0;million.&quot;</p><p>On 27 September 2008, Ledger&apos;s father Kim stated that &quot;the family has agreed to leave the US$16.3&#xA0;million fortune to Matilda,&quot; adding: &quot;There is no claim.

Later that night, his family and friends gathered for a <a href="/wiki/Wake_(ceremony)" title="Wake (ceremony)">wake</a> on <a href="/wiki/Cottesloe,_Western_Australia" title="Cottesloe, Western Australia">Cottesloe Beach</a>.</p><p>In January 2011, the <a href="/wiki/State_Theatre_Centre_of_Western_Australia" title="State Theatre Centre of Western Australia">State Theatre Centre of Western Australia</a> in Ledger&apos;s home town of <a href="/wiki/Perth" title="Perth">Perth</a> named a 575-seat theatre the Heath Ledger Theatre after him. For the opening of the theatre, Ledger&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor">Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor</a> was on display in the theatre&apos;s foyer along with his <a href="/wiki/Joker_(comics)" title="Joker (comics)">Joker</a> costume.</p><p>&quot;&quot;You know when you see the preachers down South? And they grab a believer and they go, &apos;Bwoom! I touch you with the hand of God!&apos; And they believe so strongly, they&apos;re on the ground shaking and spitting. And fuck&apos;s sake, that&apos;s the power of belief... Now, I don&apos;t believe in Jesus, but I believe in my performance. And if you can understand that the power of belief is one of the great tools of our time and that a lot of acting comes from it, you can do anything.&quot;</p><p>Portraying a variety of roles, from <a href="/wiki/Romantic_hero" title="Romantic hero">romantic heroes</a> to the reluctantly oppressed, Ledger created a <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hodgepodge" class="extiw" title="wikt:hodgepodge">hodgepodge</a> of characters that are deliberately unlike one another. &quot;I feel like I am wasting my time if I repeat myself&quot;, the actor explained. He also reflected on his inability to be happy with his work, &quot;I feel the same thing about everything I do. The day I say, &apos;It&apos;s good&apos; is the day I should start doing something else.&quot; In his own words, acting was about harnessing &quot;the infinite power of belief.&quot;</p><p>People who have worked with the actor praised him for his creativity, discipline and professionality. &quot;I&apos;ve never felt as old as I did watching Heath explore his talents,&quot; <i>The Dark Knight</i>- director Christopher Nolan has written, further claiming amazement of the actor&apos;s character development and praising Ledger as &quot;very professional&quot;. Mark Foster, who directed Ledger in <i>Monster&apos;s Ball</i>, complemented the actor as understanding, &quot;very disciplined&quot;, &quot;<a href="/wiki/Intuitive" class="mw-redirect" title="Intuitive">intuitive</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="/wiki/Observation" title="Observation">observant</a>&quot;, and taking the job &quot;very seriously&quot;. In 2007, director Todd Haynes compared Ledger&apos;s presence to actor <a href="/wiki/James_Dean" title="James Dean">James Dean</a>, casting Ledger as Robbie Clarke, a fictive personification of Bob Dylan in <i>I&apos;m Not There</i>. &quot;Dylan was completely inspired by James Dean, and Heath has a little bit of James Dean in him, even physically, a kind of precocious seriousness... As adult actors seem more and more infantile and refusing to grow up, middle-aged guys in their baseball caps, Heath is one of those young people who have a real intuition, a maturity beyond their years.&quot; Ledger, however, disconnected himself and acting from <a href="/wiki/Perfectionism_(psychology)" title="Perfectionism (psychology)">perfectionism</a>. &quot;I&apos;m always gonna pull myself apart and dissect [the work]. I mean, there&apos;s no such thing as perfection in what [actors] do. <a href="/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor" title="Pornographic film actor">Pornos</a> are more perfect than we are, because they&apos;re actually fucking.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Some people find their shtick,&quot; Ledger reflected on the categorization of style. &quot;I never figured out who &apos;Heath Ledger&apos; is on film: &apos;This is what you expect when you hire me, and it will be recognizable&apos;... People always feel compelled to sum you up, to presume that they have you and can describe you. That&apos;s fine. But there are so many stories inside of me and a lot I want to achieve outside of one flat note.&quot;</p><p>Ledger&apos;s death affected the marketing campaign for <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Nolan" title="Christopher Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a>&apos;s <i>The Dark Knight</i> (2008) and also both the production and marketing of <a href="/wiki/Terry_Gilliam" title="Terry Gilliam">Terry Gilliam</a>&apos;s film <i><a href="/wiki/The_Imaginarium_of_Doctor_Parnassus" title="The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus">The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus</a></i>, with both directors intending to celebrate and pay tribute to his work in these films. Although Gilliam temporarily suspended production on the latter film, he expressed determination to &quot;salvage&quot; it, perhaps using <a href="/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery" title="Computer-generated imagery">computer-generated imagery</a> (CGI), and dedicated it to Ledger. In February 2008, as a &quot;memorial tribute to the man many have called one of the best actors of his generation,&quot; <a href="/wiki/Johnny_Depp" title="Johnny Depp">Johnny Depp</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jude_Law" title="Jude Law">Jude Law</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Colin_Farrell" title="Colin Farrell">Colin Farrell</a> signed on to take over Ledger&apos;s role, becoming multiple incarnations of his character, Tony, transformed in this &quot;magical re-telling of the <a href="/wiki/Faust" title="Faust">Faust</a> story&quot;. The three actors donated their fees for the film to Ledger&apos;s and Williams&apos;s daughter.</p><p>Speaking of editing <i>The Dark Knight,</i> on which Ledger had completed his work in October 2007, Nolan recalled, &quot;It was tremendously emotional, right when he passed, having to go back in and look at him every day. ... But the truth is, I feel very lucky to have something productive to do, to have a performance that he was very, very proud of, and that he had entrusted to me to finish.&quot; All of Ledger&apos;s scenes appear as he completed them in the filming; in editing the film, Nolan added no &quot;digital effects&quot; to alter Ledger&apos;s actual performance posthumously. Nolan dedicated the film in part to Ledger&apos;s memory, as well as to the memory of technician Conway Wickliffe, who was killed during a car accident while preparing one of the film&apos;s stunts.</p><p>Released in July 2008, <i>The Dark Knight</i> broke several box office records and received both popular and critical accolades, especially with regard to Ledger&apos;s performance as the Joker. Even film critic <a href="/wiki/David_Denby_(film_critic)" class="mw-redirect" title="David Denby (film critic)">David Denby</a>, who does not praise the film overall in his pre-release review in <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_Yorker" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a></i>, evaluates Ledger&apos;s work highly, describing his performance as both &quot;sinister and frightening&quot; and Ledger as &quot;mesmerising in every scene&quot;, concluding: &quot;His performance is a heroic, unsettling final act: this young actor looked into the abyss.&quot; Attempting to dispel widespread speculations that Ledger&apos;s performance as the Joker had in any way led to his death (as Denby and others suggest), Ledger&apos;s co-star and friend <a href="/wiki/Christian_Bale" title="Christian Bale">Christian Bale</a>, who played opposite him as <a href="/wiki/Batman" title="Batman">Batman</a>, has stressed that, as an actor, Ledger greatly enjoyed meeting the challenges of creating that role, an experience that Ledger himself described as &quot;the most fun I&apos;ve ever had, or probably ever will have, playing a character.&quot; Terry Gilliam also refuted the claims that playing the Joker made him crazy, calling it &quot;absolute nonsense&quot; and going on to say, &quot;Heath was so solid. His feet were on the ground and he was the least neurotic person I&apos;ve ever met.&quot;</p><p>Ledger received numerous awards for his Joker role in <i>The Dark Knight</i>.
