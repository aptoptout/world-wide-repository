The outcome of the vote was approximately 67% in favour of the country&apos;s continued membership of the EEC.</p><p>The UK electorate again addressed the question on 23 June 2016, in a <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum,_2016" title="United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016">referendum on the country&apos;s membership</a>.

The country subsequently applied to join the organization in 1963 and again in 1967, but both applications were vetoed by the then <a href="/wiki/President_of_France" title="President of France">President of France</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle" title="Charles de Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a>, ostensibly because &quot;a number of aspects of Britain&apos;s economy, from working practices to agriculture&quot; [had] &quot;made Britain incompatible with Europe&quot; and that Britain harbored a &#x201C;deep-seated hostility&#x201D; to any pan-European project.</p><p>Once de Gaulle had relinquished the French presidency, the UK made a third application for membership, which was successful. On 1 January 1973 the United Kingdom joined the EEC, then often referred to in the UK as the &quot;Common Market&quot;. This was done under the <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative</a> Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Edward_Heath" title="Edward Heath">Edward Heath</a>. The opposition <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a>, led by <a href="/wiki/Harold_Wilson" title="Harold Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>, contested the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_October_1974" title="United Kingdom general election, October 1974">October 1974 general election</a> with a commitment to renegotiate Britain&apos;s terms of membership of the EEC and then hold a referendum on whether to remain in the EEC on the new terms.</p><p>This movement to leave the EU became strongly associated with the portmanteau <b>Brexit</b>. Earlier recorded uses of the term have it spelled <b>Brixit</b>, deriving it by analogy from <a href="/wiki/Grexit" class="mw-redirect" title="Grexit">Grexit</a>.</p><p>In 1975 the United Kingdom held a <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975" title="United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, 1975">referendum on whether the UK should remain in the EEC</a>. All of the major political parties and mainstream press supported continuing membership of the EEC. However, there were significant splits within the ruling Labour party, the membership of which had voted 2:1 in favour of withdrawal at a one-day <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)_Conference" title="Labour Party (UK) Conference">party conference</a> on 26 April 1975. Since the cabinet was split between strongly <a href="/wiki/Pro-Europeanism" title="Pro-Europeanism">pro-European</a> and strongly <a href="/wiki/Euroscepticism" title="Euroscepticism">anti-European</a> ministers, <a href="/wiki/Harold_Wilson" title="Harold Wilson">Harold Wilson</a> suspended the <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_convention_(political_custom)" title="Constitutional convention (political custom)">constitutional convention</a> of <a href="/wiki/Cabinet_collective_responsibility" title="Cabinet collective responsibility">Cabinet collective responsibility</a> and allowed ministers to publicly campaign on either side. Seven of the twenty-three members of the cabinet opposed EEC membership.</p><p>On 5 June 1975, the <a href="/wiki/Constituency" class="mw-redirect" title="Constituency">electorate</a> were asked to vote yes or no on the question: &quot;Do you think the UK should stay in the <a href="/wiki/European_Community" class="mw-redirect" title="European Community">European Community</a> (Common Market)?&quot; Every administrative county in the UK had a majority of &quot;Yes&quot;, except the <a href="/wiki/Shetland_Islands" class="mw-redirect" title="Shetland Islands">Shetland Islands</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Outer_Hebrides" title="Outer Hebrides">Outer Hebrides</a>. In line with the outcome of the vote, the United Kingdom remained a member of the EEC.</p><p>The opposition Labour Party campaigned in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1983" title="United Kingdom general election, 1983">1983 general election</a> on a commitment to withdraw from the EEC. It was heavily defeated as the Conservative government of <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> was re-elected. The Labour Party subsequently changed its policy.</p><p>As a result of the <a href="/wiki/Maastricht_Treaty" title="Maastricht Treaty">Maastricht Treaty</a>, the EEC became the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> on 1 November 1993. The organization had evolved from an economic union into a political union. The name change reflected this.</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Referendum_Party" title="Referendum Party">Referendum Party</a> was formed in 1994 by <a href="/wiki/Sir_James_Goldsmith" class="mw-redirect" title="Sir James Goldsmith">Sir James Goldsmith</a> to contest the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1997" title="United Kingdom general election, 1997">1997 general election</a> on a platform of providing a referendum on the UK&apos;s membership of the EU. It fielded candidates in 547 constituencies at that election and won 810,860 votes, 2.6% of total votes cast. It failed to win a single parliamentary seat as its vote was spread out, losing its <a href="/wiki/Deposit_(politics)" title="Deposit (politics)">deposit</a> (funded by Goldsmith) in 505 constituencies.</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/UK_Independence_Party" title="UK Independence Party">UK Independence Party</a> (UKIP), a <a href="/wiki/Euroscepticism" title="Euroscepticism">Eurosceptic</a> political party, was also formed in 1993. It achieved third place in the UK during the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_2004_(United_Kingdom)" title="European Parliament election, 2004 (United Kingdom)">2004 European elections</a>, second place in the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_2009_(United_Kingdom)" title="European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)">2009 European elections</a> and first place in the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_2014_(United_Kingdom)" title="European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)">2014 European elections</a>, with 27.5% of the total vote. This was the first time since the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_December_1910" title="United Kingdom general election, December 1910">1910 general election</a> that any party other than the Labour or Conservative parties had taken the largest share of the vote in a nationwide election.</p><p>In 2014, UKIP won two by-elections, triggered when the sitting Conservative MPs defected to UKIP and then resigned. These were their first elected MPs. In 2015, the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2015" title="United Kingdom general election, 2015">2015 general election</a> UKIP took 12.6% of the total vote and <a href="/wiki/Clacton_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="Clacton (UK Parliament constituency)">held</a> one of the two seats won in 2014.</p><p>In 2012, Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/David_Cameron" title="David Cameron">David Cameron</a> rejected calls for a referendum on the UK&apos;s EU membership, but suggested the possibility of a future referendum to gauge public support. According to the BBC, &quot;The prime minister acknowledged the need to ensure the UK&apos;s position within the European Union had &apos;the full-hearted support of the British people&apos; but they needed to show &apos;tactical and strategic patience&apos;.&quot;</p><p>In January 2013, Cameron announced that a Conservative government would hold an in-out referendum on EU membership before the end of 2017, on a renegotiated package, if elected in 2015.</p><p>The Conservative Party won the <a href="/wiki/2015_general_election" class="mw-redirect" title="2015 general election">2015 general election</a> with a majority. Soon afterwards the <a href="/wiki/European_Union_Referendum_Act_2015" title="European Union Referendum Act 2015">European Union Referendum Act 2015</a> was introduced into Parliament to enable the referendum. Despite being in favour of remaining in a reformed European Union himself, Cameron announced that Conservative Ministers and MPs were free to campaign in favour of remaining in the EU or leaving it, according to their conscience. This decision came after mounting pressure for a <a href="/wiki/Free_vote" class="mw-redirect" title="Free vote">free vote</a> for ministers. In an exception to the usual rule of <a href="/wiki/Cabinet_collective_responsibility" title="Cabinet collective responsibility">cabinet collective responsibility</a>, Cameron allowed cabinet ministers to publicly campaign for EU withdrawal.</p><p>In a speech to the House of Commons on 22 February 2016, Cameron announced a referendum date of 23 June 2016 and set out the legal framework for withdrawal from the European Union in circumstances where there was a referendum majority vote to leave, citing Article 50 of the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Lisbon" title="Treaty of Lisbon">Lisbon Treaty</a>. Cameron spoke of an intention to trigger the Article 50 process immediately following a leave vote and of the &quot;two-year time period to negotiate the arrangements for exit.&quot;</p><p>The official campaign group for leaving the EU was <a href="/wiki/Vote_Leave" title="Vote Leave">Vote Leave</a>. Other major campaign groups included <a href="/wiki/Leave.EU" title="Leave.EU">Leave.EU</a>, <a href="/wiki/Grassroots_Out" title="Grassroots Out">Grassroots Out</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Better_Off_Out" title="Better Off Out">Better Off Out</a>, while non-EU affiliated organisations also campaigned for the United Kingdom&apos;s withdrawal, such as the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_Freedom_of_Movement_Organisation" title="Commonwealth Freedom of Movement Organisation">Commonwealth Freedom of Movement Organisation</a>.</p><p>The official campaign to stay in the EU, chaired by <a href="/wiki/Stuart_Rose" title="Stuart Rose">Stuart Rose</a>, was known as <a href="/wiki/Britain_Stronger_in_Europe" title="Britain Stronger in Europe">Britain Stronger in Europe</a>, or informally as <i>Remain</i>. Other campaigns supporting remaining in the EU included Conservatives In, <a href="/wiki/Labour_in_for_Britain" class="mw-redirect" title="Labour in for Britain">Labour in for Britain</a>, #INtogether (Liberal Democrats), Greens for a Better Europe, Scientists for EU, Environmentalists For Europe, Universities for Europe and Another Europe is Possible.</p><p>Public opinion on whether the UK should leave the EU or stay has varied. An October 2015 analysis of polling suggested that younger voters tend to support remaining in the EU, whereas older voters tend to support leaving, but there is no gender split in attitudes.</p><p>Article 50 of the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_on_European_Union" title="Treaty on European Union">Treaty on European Union</a> provides that: &quot;Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements.&quot; Article 50 was inserted by the <a href="/wiki/Lisbon_Treaty" class="mw-redirect" title="Lisbon Treaty">Lisbon Treaty</a> in 2007, before which the treaties were silent on the possibility of <a href="/wiki/Withdrawal_from_the_European_Union" title="Withdrawal from the European Union">withdrawal from the European Union</a>. Once a member state has notified the <a href="/wiki/European_Council" title="European Council">European Council</a> of its intent to leave the EU, a period begins during which a leaving agreement is negotiated setting out the arrangements for the withdrawal and outlining the country&apos;s future relationship with the Union. For the agreement to enter into force it needs to be approved by at least 72 percent of the continuing member states representing at least 65 percent of their population, and the consent of the European Parliament. The treaties cease to apply to the member state concerned on the entry into force of the leaving agreement, or in the absence of such an agreement, two years after the member state notified the European Council of its intent to leave, although this period can be extended by unanimous agreement of the European Council. Instead of going through the internal EU process, the UK could also unilaterally withdraw by repealing the enabling <a href="/wiki/European_Communities_Act_1972_(UK)" title="European Communities Act 1972 (UK)">European Communities Act 1972 (UK)</a>.</p><p>As was the case with the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_independence_referendum,_2014" title="Scottish independence referendum, 2014">Scottish independence referendum</a> two years earlier, the 2016 referendum did not directly require the government to do anything in particular. It does not require the government to initiate, or even schedule, the Article 50 procedure, although David Cameron stated during the campaign that he would invoke Article 50 straight away in the event of a leave victory.</p><p>Some have suggested that a second referendum could be held to &quot;confirm&quot; the decision to leave following negotiations. However, there is no established, formal process for doing so. Alan Renwick of the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_Unit" title="Constitution Unit">Constitution Unit</a> of University College London argues that Article 50 negotiations cannot be used to renegotiate the conditions of future membership and that Article 50 does not provide the legal basis of withdrawing a decision to leave. The UK government has stated that they would expect a leave vote to be followed by withdrawal, not by a second vote. EU politicians largely agree.</p><p>Following the referendum result, Cameron announced that he would resign before the Conservative party conference in October, and that it would be for the incoming Prime Minister to invoke Article 50 of the EU Treaty.</p><p>However, a petition to the UK Parliament for a second referendum reached nearly 3 million signatures within two days. It asked: &quot;We the undersigned call upon HM Government to implement a rule that if the remain or leave vote is less than 60% based a turnout less than 75% there should be another referendum.&quot; The referendum of 23 June fulfils these conditions. Having received more than 100,000 signatures, the petition must receive a government response and be considered for a parliamentary debate.</p><p>Now that the UK electorate has voted to leave the EU, its subsequent relationship with the remaining EU members could take several forms. A research paper presented to the UK Parliament proposed a number of alternatives to membership which would continue to allow access with the EU <a href="/wiki/Internal_market" title="Internal market">internal market</a>. These include remaining in the <a href="/wiki/European_Economic_Area" title="European Economic Area">European Economic Area</a> (EEA) as a <a href="/wiki/European_Free_Trade_Association" title="European Free Trade Association">European Free Trade Association</a> (EFTA) member, or seeking to negotiate bilateral terms along the <a href="/wiki/Switzerland%E2%80%93European_Union_relations" title="Switzerland&#x2013;European Union relations">Swiss model</a> with a series of interdependent sectoral agreements.</p><p>Were the UK to join the EEA as an EFTA member, it would have to sign up to EU internal market legislation without being able to participate in its development or vote on its content. However, the EU is required to conduct extensive consultations with non-EU members beforehand via its many committees and cooperative bodies. Some EU law originates from various international bodies on which non-EU EEA countries have a seat.</p><p>The EEA Agreement (EU and EFTA members except Switzerland) does not cover <a href="/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy" title="Common Agricultural Policy">Common Agriculture and Fisheries Policies</a>, <a href="/wiki/European_Union_Customs_Union" title="European Union Customs Union">Customs Union</a>, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Common_Commercial_Policy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Common Commercial Policy (page does not exist)">Common Trade Policy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Common_Foreign_and_Security_Policy" title="Common Foreign and Security Policy">Common Foreign and Security Policy</a>, direct and indirect taxation, and <a href="/wiki/Police_and_Judicial_Co-operation_in_Criminal_Matters" title="Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters">Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters</a>, leaving EFTA members free to set their own policies in these areas; however, EFTA countries are required to contribute to the <a href="/wiki/EU_Budget" class="mw-redirect" title="EU Budget">EU Budget</a> in exchange for access to the internal market.</p><p>The EEA Agreement and the agreement with Switzerland cover free movement of goods, and <a href="/wiki/Free_Movement_Directive" class="mw-redirect" title="Free Movement Directive">free movement of people</a>. Many supporters of Brexit want to restrict freedom of movement, however an EEA Agreement would include free movement for EU and EEA citizens. Others present ideas of a <a href="/wiki/Switzerland%E2%80%93European_Union_relations" title="Switzerland&#x2013;European Union relations">Swiss solution</a>, that is tailor-made agreements between the UK and the EU, but EU representatives have claimed they would not support such a solution. The Swiss agreements contain free movement for EU citizens.</p><p>A report by Tim Oliver of the <a href="/wiki/German_Institute_for_International_and_Security_Affairs" title="German Institute for International and Security Affairs">German Institute for International and Security Affairs</a> expanded analysis of what a British withdrawal could mean for the EU: the report argues a UK withdrawal &quot;has the potential to fundamentally change the EU and European integration. On the one hand, a withdrawal could tip the EU towards protectionism, exacerbate existing divisions, or unleash centrifugal forces leading to the EU&apos;s unravelling. Alternatively, the EU could free itself of its most awkward member, making the EU easier to lead and more effective.&quot;</p><p>After the announcement of the outcome of the referendum on 24 June 2016, indicating that Britain would leave the European Union, political correspondent for <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> Rowena Mason offered the following assessment: &quot;Polling suggests discontent with the scale of migration to the UK has been the biggest factor pushing Britons to vote out, with the contest turning into a referendum on whether people are happy to accept free movement in return for free trade.&quot; A <i><a href="/wiki/Times_of_London" class="mw-redirect" title="Times of London">Times</a></i> columnist, <a href="/wiki/Philip_Collins_(journalist)" title="Philip Collins (journalist)">Philip Collins</a>, went a step further in his analysis: &quot;This was a referendum about immigration disguised as a referendum about the European Union.&quot;</p><p>The Conservative <a href="/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament" title="Member of the European Parliament">MEP</a> representing South East England, <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Hannan" title="Daniel Hannan">Daniel Hannan</a>, predicted on BBC <a href="/wiki/Newsnight" title="Newsnight">Newsnight</a> that the level of immigration would remain high after Brexit: &quot;Frankly, if people watching think that they have voted and there is now going to be zero immigration from the EU, they are going to be disappointed. ... you will look in vain for anything that the Leave campaign said at any point that ever suggested there would ever be any kind of border closure or drawing up of the drawbridge.&quot;</p><p>The UK treasury have estimated that being in the EU has a strong positive effect on trade and as a result the UK&apos;s trade would be worse off if it left the EU.</p><p>Supporters of withdrawal from the EU have argued that by ceasing to make a net contribution to the EU would allow for some cuts to taxes and/or increases in government spending. However, Britain would still be required to make contributions to the EU budget if it opted to remain in the European Free Trade Area. The Institute for Fiscal Studies notes that most majority of forecasts of the impact of Brexit on the UK economy would leave the government with less money to spend even if it no longer had to pay into the EU.</p><p>Former <a href="/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer" title="Chancellor of the Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> <a href="/wiki/Norman_Lamont" title="Norman Lamont">Norman Lamont</a> argued that if Britain left the EU, the EU would not impose retaliatory tariffs on British products, pointing out that the EU needed a trade agreement with Britain as German car manufacturers wanted to sell their cars to the world&apos;s fifth biggest market. Lamont argued that the <a href="/wiki/EFTA" class="mw-redirect" title="EFTA">EFTA</a> option was irrelevant and that Britain and the EU would agree on a trade pact which tailored to Britain&apos;s needs.</p><p><a href="/wiki/James_Dyson" title="James Dyson">James Dyson</a> argued that it would be self-defeating for the EU to impose retaliatory <a href="/wiki/Tariff" title="Tariff">tariffs</a> on British products because if the EU imposed a tariff on Britain, Britain would impose a retaliatory tariff on the EU, claiming that Britain bought 100&#xA0;billion pounds worth of the EU&apos;s goods and sold 10&#xA0;billion pounds worth of Britain&apos;s goods. However, proportionally, the government responded that &quot;EU exports to the UK are worth 3% of EU GDP, while UK exports to the EU are worth 13% of UK GDP &#x2013; four times more.&quot;</p><p>On 15 June 2016, <a href="/wiki/Vote_Leave" title="Vote Leave">Vote Leave</a>, the official Leave campaign, presented its roadmap to lay out what would happen if Britain left the EU. The blueprint suggested that Parliament would pass laws: Finance Bill to scrap VAT on <a href="/wiki/Tampon" title="Tampon">tampons</a> and household energy bills; Asylum and Immigration Control Bill to end the automatic right of EU citizens to enter Britain; National Health Service (Funding Target) Bill to get an extra 100 million pounds a week; European Union Law (Emergency Provisions) Bill; Free Trade Bill to start to negotiate its own deals with non-EU countries; and European Communities Act 1972 (Repeal) Bill to end the <a href="/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice" title="European Court of Justice">European Court of Justice</a>&apos;s jurisdiction over Britain and stop making contribution to the EU budget.</p><p>Many nations may gain benefits from Brexit. One example is the potential for increased real estate prices in New York.

Credit rating agency <a href="/wiki/Standard_%26_Poor%27s" title="Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s">Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s</a>, the only major agency to still assigning Britain the top, triple-A grade, had stated before Thursday&apos;s referendum that Britain was likely to face a downgrade if it voted to leave, while <a href="/wiki/Fitch_Ratings" title="Fitch Ratings">Fitch Ratings</a> stated on Friday that the vote would be &quot;moderately negative&quot; for the country&apos;s rating. On the other hand, economic analysts have pointed out that the UK, as a fiscally and monetarily sovereign nation, retains the ability to service or retire, at any time, any part or all of the state debt that is denominated in the <a href="/wiki/National_currency" class="mw-redirect" title="National currency">national currency</a>, and, hence, there is no risk whatsoever of defaulting on that part of its debt.</p><p>During a press conference on 27 June 2016, Chancellor of the Exchequer <a href="/wiki/George_Osborne" title="George Osborne">George Osborne</a> attempted to reassure financial markets that the UK economy was not in serious trouble. This came after media reports that a survey by the <a href="/wiki/Institute_of_Directors" title="Institute of Directors">Institute of Directors</a> suggested that two thirds of businesses believed that the outcome of the referendum would produce negative results as well as the dropping value of the sterling and the FTSE 100 which began on Friday, 24 June 2016. British businesses had also predicted that investment cuts, hiring freezes and redundancies would be necessary to cope with the results of the referendum. Osborne indicated that Britain was facing the future &quot;from a position of strength&quot; and there was no current need for an emergency Budget. &quot;No one should doubt our resolve to maintain the fiscal stability we have delivered for this country .... And to companies, large and small, I would say this: the British economy is fundamentally strong, highly competitive and we are open for business.&quot;</p><p>Later that afternoon, the sterling was at a 31-year low against the Dollar, having fallen 11% in two trading days and the FTSE 100 index had surrendered &#xA3;85 billion. And the UK was stripped of its AAA credit rating by Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s, down to AA, with the following comment: &quot;In our opinion, this outcome is a seminal event, and will lead to a less predictable, stable, and effective policy framework in the U.K. ... The negative outlook reflects the risk to economic prospects, fiscal and external performance, and the role of sterling as a reserve currency...&quot; Fitch&apos;s degraded the credit rating from &quot;AA+&quot; to &quot;AA&quot; because of &quot;uncertainty following the referendum outcome will induce an abrupt slowdown in short-term GDP growth...&quot;.</p><p>European experts from the <a href="/wiki/World_Pensions_%26_Investments_Forum" title="World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum">World Pensions Forum</a> and the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Bath" title="University of Bath">University of Bath</a> have argued that, beyond short-lived market volatility, the long term economic prospects of Britain remain high, notably in terms of <a href="/wiki/Country_attractiveness" title="Country attractiveness">country attractiveness</a> and <a href="/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment" title="Foreign direct investment">foreign direct investment</a>: &quot;Country risk experts we spoke to are confident the UK&apos;s economy will remain robust in the event of an exit from the EU. &apos;The economic attractiveness of Britain will not go down and a trade war with London is in no one&apos;s interest,&apos; says M Nicolas Firzli, director-general of the World Pensions Council (WPC) and advisory board member for the World Bank Global Infrastructure Facility [...] Bruce Morley, lecturer in economics at the University of Bath, goes further to suggest that the long-term benefits to the UK of leaving the Union, such as less regulation and more control over Britain&apos;s trade policy, could outweigh the short-term uncertainty observed in the [country risk] scores.&quot;</p><p>Leading figures both supportive and not of <a href="/wiki/Scottish_independence" title="Scottish independence">Scottish independence</a> have suggested that in the event the UK as a whole votes to leave the EU but Scotland as a whole votes to remain in the EU (as it has transpired), a <a href="/wiki/Second_Scottish_independence_referendum" class="mw-redirect" title="Second Scottish independence referendum">second Scottish independence referendum</a> may be precipitated. Former Labour Scottish First Minister <a href="/wiki/Henry_McLeish" title="Henry McLeish">Henry McLeish</a> has said that he would support Scottish independence under such circumstances.

The petition had been initiated by William Oliver Healey of the <a href="/wiki/English_Democrats" title="English Democrats">English Democrats</a> on 24 May 2016, when the Remain faction had been leading in the polls. On 26 June Healey made it clear on his <a href="/wiki/Facebook" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> page that the petition had actually been started to favour an exit from the EU and that he was a strong supporter of the Vote Leave and Grassroots Out campaigns.

After a plausible British invocation of article 50, a negotiation period begins, which has a <i>maximum duration</i> of two years (counted from the invoking date, <b>not</b> the referendum date). If the negotiations are not finished within a duration of two years, then current negotiations between the UK and other EU countries will cease. New treaties between the United Kingdom and EU-countries will become much more complicated, as the United Kingdom will leave the European Union regardless of the negotiations exactly 2 years after the invoking of article 50. One could say that Britain currently has the initiative <i>as long as article 50 isn&apos;t invoked</i>. . It must be the PM&apos;s decision to trigger article 50 withdrawal.  Once the Prime Minister does this, there may be difficulty in recovering EU membership after withdrawal.</p><p>If on the other hand, the United Kingdom delays invocation of article 50, an awkward situation may emerge. Then the negotiations cannot begin and the United Kingdom will formally be treated as a member of the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a>, and must hence continue to fulfill all EU-related treaties, including possible future agreements. But the EU has no framework to exclude the United Kingdom or any member as long as article 50 isn&apos;t invoked . For the remaining EU countries, for the financial markets, and not to speak of the United Kingdom itself, a fast invoking of article 50 is desirable. A solution may be to call for a new referendum in the UK.</p>
