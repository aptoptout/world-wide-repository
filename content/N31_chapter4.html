<p><b>Cloud computing</b> is a kind of Internet-based computing that provides shared processing resources and data to computers and other devices on demand. It is a model for enabling ubiquitous, on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications and services), which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort. Cloud computing and storage solutions provide users and enterprises with various capabilities to store and process their data in third-party <a href="/wiki/Data_center" title="Data center">data centers</a>. It relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and <a href="/wiki/Economies_of_scale" title="Economies of scale">economy of scale</a>, similar to a utility (like the <a href="/wiki/Electrical_grid" title="Electrical grid">electricity grid</a>) over a network.</p><p>Advocates claim that cloud computing allows companies to avoid upfront infrastructure costs, and focus on projects that differentiate their businesses instead of on infrastructure. Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and enables IT to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable business demand. Cloud providers typically use a &quot;pay as you go&quot; model. This will lead to unexpectedly high charges if administrators do not adapt to the cloud pricing model.</p><p>The present availability of high-capacity networks, low-cost computers and storage devices as well as the widespread adoption of <a href="/wiki/Hardware_virtualization" title="Hardware virtualization">hardware virtualization</a>, <a href="/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture" title="Service-oriented architecture">service-oriented architecture</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Autonomic_Computing" class="mw-redirect" title="Autonomic Computing">autonomic</a> and utility computing have led to a growth in cloud computing. Companies can scale up as computing needs increase and then scale down again as demands decrease.</p><p>Cloud computing has become a highly demanded service or utility due to the advantages of high computing power, cheap cost of services, high performance, scalability, accessibility as well as availability. Some cloud vendors are experiencing growth rates of 50% per year, but being still in a stage of infancy, it has pitfalls that need to be addressed to make cloud computing services more reliable and user friendly.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The origin of the term <i>cloud computing</i> in computing is unclear. The word &quot;cloud&quot; is commonly used in science to describe a large agglomeration of objects that visually appear from a distance as a cloud and describes any set of things whose details are not further inspected in a given context. Another explanation is that the old programs that drew network schematics surrounded the icons for servers with a circle, and a cluster of servers in a network diagram had several overlapping circles, which resembled a cloud.</p><p>In analogy to the above usage, the word <i>cloud</i> was used as a metaphor for the Internet and a standardized cloud-like shape was used to denote a network on telephony schematics. Later it was used to depict the Internet in <a href="/wiki/Computer_network_diagram" title="Computer network diagram">computer network diagrams</a>. With this simplification, the implication is that the specifics of how the end points of a network are connected are not relevant for the purposes of understanding the diagram. The cloud symbol was used to represent networks of computing equipment in the original <a href="/wiki/ARPANET" title="ARPANET">ARPANET</a> by as early as 1977, and the <a href="/wiki/CSNET" title="CSNET">CSNET</a> by 1981&#x2014;both predecessors to the Internet itself.</p><p>The term <i>cloud</i> has been used to refer to platforms for <a href="/wiki/Distributed_computing" title="Distributed computing">distributed computing</a>. In <i><a href="/wiki/Wired_(magazine)" title="Wired (magazine)">Wired&apos;s</a></i> April 1994 feature &quot;Bill and Andy&apos;s Excellent Adventure II&quot; on the <a href="/wiki/Apple_Inc." title="Apple Inc.">Apple</a> spin-off <a href="/wiki/General_Magic" title="General Magic">General Magic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Andy_Hertzfeld" title="Andy Hertzfeld">Andy Hertzfeld</a> commented on General Magic&apos;s distributed programming language <a href="/wiki/Telescript_(programming_language)" title="Telescript (programming language)">Telescript</a> that:</p><p>&quot;The beauty of Telescript&#xA0;... is that now, instead of just having a device to program, we now have the entire Cloud out there, where a single program can go and travel to many different sources of information and create sort of a virtual service. No one had conceived that before. The example Jim White [the designer of Telescript, <a href="/wiki/X.400" title="X.400">X.400</a> and <a href="/wiki/ASN.1" class="mw-redirect" title="ASN.1">ASN.1</a>] uses now is a date-arranging service where a software agent goes to the flower store and orders flowers and then goes to the ticket shop and gets the tickets for the show, and everything is communicated to both parties.&quot;</p><p>References to &quot;cloud computing&quot; in its modern sense appeared as early as 1996, with the earliest known mention in a <a href="/wiki/Compaq" title="Compaq">Compaq</a> internal document.</p><p>The popularization of the term can be traced to 2006 when Amazon.com introduced its <a href="/wiki/Amazon_Elastic_Compute_Cloud" title="Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud">Elastic Compute Cloud</a>.</p><p>During the 1960s, the initial concepts of time-sharing became popularized via RJE (<a href="/wiki/Remote_Job_Entry" class="mw-redirect" title="Remote Job Entry">Remote Job Entry</a>); this terminology was mostly associated with large vendors such as <a href="/wiki/IBM" title="IBM">IBM</a> and <a href="/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation" title="Digital Equipment Corporation">DEC</a>. Full time-sharing solutions were available by the early 1970s on such platforms as Multics (on GE hardware), Cambridge CTSS, and the earliest UNIX ports (on DEC hardware). Yet, the &quot;data center&quot; model where users submitted jobs to operators to run on IBM mainframes was overwhelmingly predominant.</p><p>In the 1990s, telecommunications companies, who previously offered primarily dedicated point-to-point data circuits, began offering <a href="/wiki/Virtual_private_network" title="Virtual private network">virtual private network</a> (VPN) services with comparable quality of service, but at a lower cost. By switching traffic as they saw fit to balance server use, they could use overall network bandwidth more effectively. They began to use the cloud symbol to denote the demarcation point between what the provider was responsible for and what users were responsible for. Cloud computing extended this boundary to cover all servers as well as the network infrastructure.</p><p>As computers became more diffused, scientists and technologists explored ways to make large-scale computing power available to more users through time-sharing. They experimented with algorithms to optimize the infrastructure, platform, and applications to prioritize CPUs and increase efficiency for end users.</p><p>Since 2000, cloud computing has come into existence. In early 2008, <a href="/wiki/NASA" title="NASA">NASA</a>&apos;s <a href="/wiki/OpenNebula" title="OpenNebula">OpenNebula</a>, enhanced in the RESERVOIR European Commission-funded project, became the first open-source software for deploying private and hybrid clouds, and for the federation of clouds. In the same year, efforts were focused on providing <a href="/wiki/Quality_of_service" title="Quality of service">quality of service</a> guarantees (as required by real-time interactive applications) to cloud-based infrastructures, in the framework of the IRMOS European Commission-funded project, resulting in a real-time cloud environment. By mid-2008, Gartner saw an opportunity for cloud computing &quot;to shape the relationship among consumers of IT services, those who use IT services and those who sell them&quot; and observed that &quot;organizations are switching from company-owned hardware and software assets to per-use service-based models&quot; so that the &quot;projected shift to computing&#xA0;... will result in dramatic growth in IT products in some areas and significant reductions in other areas.&quot;</p><p>In August 2006 <a href="/wiki/Amazon.com" title="Amazon.com">Amazon</a> introduced its <a href="/wiki/Amazon_Elastic_Compute_Cloud" title="Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud">Elastic Compute Cloud</a>. <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Azure" title="Microsoft Azure">Microsoft Azure</a> was announced as &quot;Azure&quot; in October 2008 and was released on 1 February 2010 as Windows Azure, before being renamed to Microsoft Azure on 25 March 2014. For a time, Azure was on the <a href="/wiki/TOP500" title="TOP500">TOP500</a> supercomputer list, before it dropped off it.</p><p>In July 2010, <a href="/wiki/Rackspace" title="Rackspace">Rackspace Hosting</a> and <a href="/wiki/NASA" title="NASA">NASA</a> jointly launched an open-source cloud-software initiative known as <a href="/wiki/OpenStack" title="OpenStack">OpenStack</a>. The OpenStack project intended to help organizations offering cloud-computing services running on standard hardware. The early code came from NASA&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Nebula_(computing_platform)" title="Nebula (computing platform)">Nebula platform</a> as well as from <a href="/wiki/Rackspace_Cloud#Cloud_Files" title="Rackspace Cloud">Rackspace&apos;s Cloud Files</a> platform.</p><p>On March 1, 2011, IBM announced the <a href="/wiki/IBM_cloud_computing#IBM_SmartCloud" title="IBM cloud computing">IBM SmartCloud</a> framework to support <a href="/wiki/Smarter_Planet" title="Smarter Planet">Smarter Planet</a>. Among the various components of the <a href="/wiki/Smarter_Computing" class="mw-redirect" title="Smarter Computing">Smarter Computing</a> foundation, cloud computing is a critical part.</p><p>On June 7, 2012, Oracle announced the <a href="/wiki/Oracle_Corporation#Services" title="Oracle Corporation">Oracle Cloud</a>. While aspects of the Oracle Cloud are still in development, this cloud offering is poised to be the first to provide users with access to an integrated set of IT solutions, including the Applications (<a href="/wiki/SaaS" class="mw-redirect" title="SaaS">SaaS</a>), Platform (<a href="/wiki/PaaS" class="mw-redirect" title="PaaS">PaaS</a>), and Infrastructure (<a href="/wiki/IaaS" class="mw-redirect" title="IaaS">IaaS</a>) layers.</p><p>Cloud computing is the result of the evolution and adoption of existing technologies and paradigms. The goal of cloud computing is to allow users to take bene&#xFB01;t from all of these technologies, without the need for deep knowledge about or expertise with each one of them. The cloud aims to cut costs, and helps the users focus on their core business instead of being impeded by IT obstacles.</p><p>The main enabling technology for cloud computing is <a href="/wiki/Virtualization" title="Virtualization">virtualization</a>. Virtualization software separates a physical computing device into one or more &quot;virtual&quot; devices, each of which can be easily used and managed to perform computing tasks. With <a href="/wiki/Operating_system%E2%80%93level_virtualization" class="mw-redirect" title="Operating system&#x2013;level virtualization">operating system&#x2013;level virtualization</a> essentially creating a scalable system of multiple independent computing devices, idle computing resources can be allocated and used more efficiently. Virtualization provides the agility required to speed up IT operations, and reduces cost by increasing infrastructure <a href="/wiki/Utilization" title="Utilization">utilization</a>. Autonomic computing automates the process through which the user can provision resources <a href="/wiki/Code_on_demand" title="Code on demand">on-demand</a>. By minimizing user involvement, automation speeds up the process, reduces labor costs and reduces the possibility of human errors.</p><p>Users routinely face difficult business problems. Cloud computing adopts concepts from <a href="/wiki/Service-oriented_Architecture" class="mw-redirect" title="Service-oriented Architecture">Service-oriented Architecture</a> (SOA) that can help the user break these problems into <a href="/wiki/Service_(systems_architecture)" title="Service (systems architecture)">services</a> that can be integrated to provide a solution. Cloud computing provides all of its resources as services, and makes use of the well-established standards and best practices gained in the domain of SOA to allow global and easy access to cloud services in a standardized way.</p><p>Cloud computing also leverages concepts from utility computing to provide <a href="/wiki/Performance_metric" title="Performance metric">metrics</a> for the services used. Such metrics are at the core of the public cloud pay-per-use models. In addition, measured services are an essential part of the feedback loop in autonomic computing, allowing services to scale on-demand and to perform automatic failure recovery.</p><p>Cloud computing is a kind of <a href="/wiki/Grid_computing" title="Grid computing">grid computing</a>; it has evolved by addressing the QoS (quality of service) and <a href="/wiki/Reliability_(computer_networking)" title="Reliability (computer networking)">reliability</a> problems. Cloud computing provides the tools and technologies to build data/compute intensive parallel applications with much more affordable prices compared to traditional <a href="/wiki/Parallel_computing" title="Parallel computing">parallel computing</a> techniques.</p><p>Cloud computing shares characteristics with:</p><p>Cloud computing exhibits the following key characteristics:</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology" title="National Institute of Standards and Technology">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a>&apos;s definition of cloud computing identifies &quot;five essential characteristics&quot;:</p><p><i>On-demand self-service.</i> A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.</p><p><i>Broad network access.</i> Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).</p><p><i>Resource pooling.</i> The provider&apos;s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand.&#xA0;</p><p><i>Rapid elasticity.</i> Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.</p><p>Though <a href="/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture" title="Service-oriented architecture">service-oriented architecture</a> advocates &quot;everything as a service&quot; (with the acronyms <b>EaaS</b> or <b>XaaS</b> or simply <b><a href="/wiki/As_a_service" title="As a service">aas</a></b>), cloud-computing providers offer their &quot;services&quot; according to different models, which happen to form a <a href="/wiki/Solution_stack" title="Solution stack">stack</a>: infrastructure-, platform- and software-as-a-service.</p><p>According to the <a href="/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force" title="Internet Engineering Task Force">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> (IETF), the most basic cloud-service model is that of providers offering computing infrastructure &#x2013; <a href="/wiki/Virtual_machine" title="Virtual machine">virtual machines</a> and other resources &#x2013; as a service to subscribers. <b>Infrastructure as a service</b> (IaaS) refers to online services that abstract the user from the details of infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc. A <a href="/wiki/Hypervisor" title="Hypervisor">hypervisor</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Xen" title="Xen">Xen</a>, <a href="/wiki/VirtualBox" title="VirtualBox">Oracle VirtualBox</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oracle_VM_Server_for_x86" title="Oracle VM Server for x86">Oracle VM</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine" title="Kernel-based Virtual Machine">KVM</a>, <a href="/wiki/VMware_ESX" title="VMware ESX">VMware ESX/ESXi</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Hyper-V" title="Hyper-V">Hyper-V</a>, runs the virtual machines as guests. Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers&apos; varying requirements. Linux containers run in isolated partitions of a single Linux kernel running directly on the physical hardware. Linux cgroups and namespaces are the underlying Linux kernel technologies used to isolate, secure and manage the containers. Containerisation offers higher performance than virtualization, because there is no hypervisor overhead. Also, container capacity auto-scales dynamically with computing load, which eliminates the problem of over-provisioning and enables usage-based billing. IaaS clouds often offer additional resources such as a virtual-machine <a href="/wiki/Disk_image" title="Disk image">disk-image</a> library, raw <a href="/wiki/Block_storage" class="mw-redirect" title="Block storage">block storage</a>, file or <a href="/wiki/Object_storage" title="Object storage">object storage</a>, firewalls, load balancers, IP addresses, <a href="/wiki/VLAN" class="mw-redirect" title="VLAN">virtual local area networks</a> (VLANs), and software bundles. IaaS-cloud providers supply these resources on-demand from their large pools of equipment installed in <a href="/wiki/Data_centers" class="mw-redirect" title="Data centers">data centers</a>. For <a href="/wiki/Wide_area_network" title="Wide area network">wide-area</a> connectivity, customers can use either the Internet or <a href="/wiki/Carrier_cloud" title="Carrier cloud">carrier clouds</a> (dedicated <a href="/wiki/Virtual_private_network" title="Virtual private network">virtual private networks</a>).</p><p>To deploy their applications, cloud users install operating-system images and their application software on the cloud infrastructure. In this model, the cloud user patches and maintains the operating systems and the application software. Cloud providers typically bill IaaS services on a utility computing basis: cost reflects the amount of resources allocated and consumed.</p><p>PaaS vendors offer a development environment to application developers. The provider typically develops toolkit and standards for development and channels for distribution and payment. In the PaaS models, cloud providers deliver a <a href="/wiki/Computing_platform" title="Computing platform">computing platform</a>, typically including operating system, programming-language execution environment, database, and web server. Application developers can develop and run their software solutions on a cloud platform without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layers. With some PaaS offers like <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Azure" title="Microsoft Azure">Microsoft Azure</a> and <a href="/wiki/Google_App_Engine" title="Google App Engine">Google App Engine</a>, the underlying computer and storage resources scale automatically to match application demand so that the cloud user does not have to allocate resources manually. The latter has also been proposed by an architecture aiming to facilitate real-time in cloud environments. Even more specific application types can be provided via PaaS, such as media encoding as provided by services like bitcodin.com or media.io.</p><p>Some integration and data management providers have also embraced specialized applications of PaaS as delivery models for data solutions. Examples include <b>iPaaS</b> and <b>dPaaS</b>. iPaaS (Integration Platform as a Service) enables customers to develop, execute and govern integration flows. Under the iPaaS integration model, customers drive the development and deployment of integrations without installing or managing any hardware or middleware. dPaaS (Data Platform as a Service) delivers integration&#x2014;and data-management&#x2014;products as a fully managed service. Under the dPaaS model, the PaaS provider, not the customer, manages the development and execution of data solutions by building tailored data applications for the customer. dPaaS users retain transparency and control over data through <a href="/wiki/Data_visualization" title="Data visualization">data-visualization</a> tools.</p><p>Platform as a Service (PaaS) consumers do not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but have control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.</p><p>In the software as a service (SaaS) model, users gain access to application software and databases. Cloud providers manage the infrastructure and platforms that run the applications. SaaS is sometimes referred to as &quot;on-demand software&quot; and is usually priced on a pay-per-use basis or using a subscription fee.</p><p>In the SaaS model, cloud providers install and operate application software in the cloud and cloud users access the software from cloud clients. Cloud users do not manage the cloud infrastructure and platform where the application runs. This eliminates the need to install and run the application on the cloud user&apos;s own computers, which simplifies maintenance and support. Cloud applications differ from other applications in their scalability&#x2014;which can be achieved by cloning tasks onto multiple <a href="/wiki/Virtual_machines" class="mw-redirect" title="Virtual machines">virtual machines</a> at run-time to meet changing work demand. <a href="/wiki/Load_balancer" class="mw-redirect" title="Load balancer">Load balancers</a> distribute the work over the set of virtual machines. This process is transparent to the cloud user, who sees only a single access-point. To accommodate a large number of cloud users, cloud applications can be <i><a href="/wiki/Multitenant" class="mw-redirect" title="Multitenant">multitenant</a></i>, meaning that any machine may serve more than one cloud-user organization.</p><p>The pricing model for SaaS applications is typically a monthly or yearly flat fee per user, so prices become scalable and adjustable if users are added or removed at any point.</p><p>Proponents claim that SaaS gives a <a href="/wiki/Business" title="Business">business</a> the potential to reduce IT operational costs by outsourcing hardware and software maintenance and support to the cloud provider. This enables the business to reallocate IT operations costs away from hardware/software spending and from personnel expenses, towards meeting other goals. In addition, with applications hosted centrally, updates can be released without the need for users to install new software. One drawback of SaaS comes with storing the users&apos; data on the cloud provider&apos;s server. As a result, there could be unauthorized access to the data. For this reason, users are increasingly adopting intelligent third-party <a href="/wiki/Key_management" title="Key management">key-management</a> systems to help secure their data.</p><p>Users access cloud computing using networked client devices, such as <a href="/wiki/Desktop_computers" class="mw-redirect" title="Desktop computers">desktop computers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Laptop" title="Laptop">laptops</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tablet_computer" title="Tablet computer">tablets</a> and <a href="/wiki/Smartphones" class="mw-redirect" title="Smartphones">smartphones</a> and any Ethernet enabled device such as Home Automation Gadgets. Some of these devices&#x2014;<i>cloud clients</i>&#x2014;rely on cloud computing for all or a majority of their applications so as to be essentially useless without it. Examples are <a href="/wiki/Thin_clients" class="mw-redirect" title="Thin clients">thin clients</a> and the browser-based <a href="/wiki/Chromebook" title="Chromebook">Chromebook</a>. Many cloud applications do not require specific software on the client and instead use a web browser to interact with the cloud application. With <a href="/wiki/Ajax_(programming)" title="Ajax (programming)">Ajax</a> and <a href="/wiki/HTML5" title="HTML5">HTML5</a> these <a href="/wiki/Web_user_interface" class="mw-redirect" title="Web user interface">Web user interfaces</a> can achieve a similar, or even better, <a href="/wiki/Look_and_feel" title="Look and feel">look and feel</a> to native applications. Some cloud applications, however, support specific client software dedicated to these applications (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Desktop_virtualization" title="Desktop virtualization">virtual desktop</a> clients and most email clients). Some legacy applications (line of business applications that until now have been prevalent in thin client computing) are delivered via a screen-sharing technology.</p><p>Private cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third-party, and hosted either internally or externally. Undertaking a private cloud project requires a significant level and degree of engagement to virtualize the business environment, and requires the organization to reevaluate decisions about existing resources. When done right, it can improve business, but every step in the project raises security issues that must be addressed to prevent serious vulnerabilities. Self-run data centers are generally capital intensive. They have a significant physical footprint, requiring allocations of space, hardware, and environmental controls. These assets have to be refreshed periodically, resulting in additional capital expenditures. They have attracted criticism because users &quot;still have to buy, build, and manage them&quot; and thus do not benefit from less hands-on management, essentially &quot;[lacking] the economic model that makes cloud computing such an intriguing concept&quot;.</p><p>A cloud is called a &quot;public cloud&quot; when the services are rendered over a network that is open for public use. Public cloud services may be free. Technically there may be little or no difference between public and private cloud architecture, however, security consideration may be substantially different for services (applications, storage, and other resources) that are made available by a service provider for a public audience and when communication is effected over a non-trusted network. Generally, public cloud service providers like <a href="/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services" title="Amazon Web Services">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS), Microsoft and Google own and operate the infrastructure at their <a href="/wiki/Data_center" title="Data center">data center</a> and access is generally via the Internet. AWS and Microsoft also offer direct connect services called &quot;AWS Direct Connect&quot; and &quot;Azure ExpressRoute&quot; respectively, such connections require customers to purchase or lease a private connection to a peering point offered by the cloud provider.</p><p>Hybrid cloud is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community or public) that remain distinct entities but are bound together, offering the benefits of multiple deployment models. Hybrid cloud can also mean the ability to connect collocation, managed and/or dedicated services with cloud resources.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Gartner" title="Gartner">Gartner, Inc.</a> defines a hybrid cloud service as a cloud computing service that is composed of some combination of private, public and community cloud services, from different service providers. A hybrid cloud service crosses isolation and provider boundaries so that it can&apos;t be simply put in one category of private, public, or community cloud service. It allows one to extend either the capacity or the capability of a cloud service, by aggregation, integration or customization with another cloud service.</p><p>Varied use cases for hybrid cloud composition exist. For example, an organization may store sensitive client data in house on a private cloud application, but interconnect that application to a business intelligence application provided on a public cloud as a software service. This example of hybrid cloud extends the capabilities of the enterprise to deliver a specific business service through the addition of externally available public cloud services. Hybrid cloud adoption depends on a number of factors such as data security and compliance requirements, level of control needed over data, and the applications an organization uses.</p><p>Another example of hybrid cloud is one where <a href="/wiki/Information_technology" title="Information technology">IT</a> organizations use public cloud computing resources to meet temporary capacity needs that can not be met by the private cloud. This capability enables hybrid clouds to employ cloud bursting for scaling across clouds. Cloud bursting is an application deployment model in which an application runs in a private cloud or data center and &quot;bursts&quot; to a public cloud when the demand for computing capacity increases. A primary advantage of cloud bursting and a hybrid cloud model is that an organization only pays for extra compute resources when they are needed. Cloud bursting enables data centers to create an in-house IT infrastructure that supports average workloads, and use cloud resources from public or private clouds, during spikes in processing demands.</p><p>The specialized model of hybrid cloud, which is built atop heterogeneous hardware, is called &quot;Cross-platform Hybrid Cloud&quot;. A cross-platform hybrid cloud is usually powered by different CPU architectures, for example, x86-64 and ARM, underneath. Users can transparently deploy and scale applications without knowledge of the cloud&apos;s hardware diversity. This kind of cloud emerges from the raise of ARM-based system-on-chip for server-class computing.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Community_cloud" title="Community cloud">Community cloud</a> shares infrastructure between several organizations from a specific community with common concerns (security, compliance, jurisdiction, etc.), whether managed internally or by a third-party, and either hosted internally or externally. The costs are spread over fewer users than a public cloud (but more than a private cloud), so only some of the cost savings potential of cloud computing are realized.</p><p>A cloud computing platform can be assembled from a distributed set of machines in different locations, connected to a single network or hub service. It is possible to distinguish between two types of distributed clouds: public-resource computing and volunteer cloud.</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Intercloud" title="Intercloud">Intercloud</a> is an interconnected global &quot;cloud of clouds&quot; and an extension of the Internet &quot;network of networks&quot; on which it is based. The focus is on direct <a href="/wiki/Interoperability" title="Interoperability">interoperability</a> between public cloud service providers, more so than between providers and consumers (as is the case for hybrid- and multi-cloud).</p><p>Multicloud is the use of multiple cloud computing services in a single heterogeneous architecture to reduce reliance on single vendors, increase flexibility through choice, mitigate against disasters, etc. It differs from hybrid cloud in that it refers to multiple cloud services, rather than multiple deployment modes (public, private, legacy).</p><p><b>Cloud architecture</b>, the <a href="/wiki/Systems_architecture" title="Systems architecture">systems architecture</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Software_systems" class="mw-redirect" title="Software systems">software systems</a> involved in the delivery of cloud computing, typically involves multiple <i>cloud components</i> communicating with each other over a loose coupling mechanism such as a messaging queue. Elastic provision implies intelligence in the use of tight or loose coupling as applied to mechanisms such as these and others.</p><p><b><a href="/wiki/Cloud_engineering" title="Cloud engineering">Cloud engineering</a></b> is the application of <a href="/wiki/Engineering" title="Engineering">engineering</a> disciplines to cloud computing. It brings a systematic approach to the high-level concerns of commercialization, standardization, and governance in conceiving, developing, operating and maintaining cloud computing systems. It is a multidisciplinary method encompassing contributions from diverse areas such as <a href="/wiki/Systems_engineering" title="Systems engineering">systems</a>, <a href="/wiki/Software_engineering" title="Software engineering">software</a>, <a href="/wiki/Web_engineering" title="Web engineering">web</a>, <a href="/wiki/Performance_engineering" title="Performance engineering">performance</a>, <a href="/wiki/Information_engineering" title="Information engineering">information</a>, <a href="/wiki/Security_engineering" title="Security engineering">security</a>, <a href="/wiki/Platform_engineering" class="mw-redirect" title="Platform engineering">platform</a>, <a href="/wiki/Risk_analysis_(engineering)" title="Risk analysis (engineering)">risk</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Quality_control" title="Quality control">quality</a> engineering.</p><p>Cloud computing poses privacy concerns because the service provider can access the data that is in the cloud at any time. It could accidentally or deliberately alter or even delete information. Many cloud providers can share information with third parties if necessary for purposes of law and order even without a warrant. That is permitted in their privacy policies, which users must agree to before they start using cloud services. Solutions to privacy include policy and legislation as well as end users&apos; choices for how data is stored. Users can encrypt data that is processed or stored within the cloud to prevent unauthorized access.</p><p>According to the <a href="/wiki/Cloud_Security_Alliance" title="Cloud Security Alliance">Cloud Security Alliance</a>, the top three threats in the cloud are <i>Insecure Interfaces and API&apos;s</i>, <i>Data Loss &amp; Leakage</i>, and <i>Hardware Failure</i>&#x2014;which accounted for 29%, 25% and 10% of all cloud security outages respectively. Together, these form shared technology vulnerabilities. In a cloud provider platform being shared by different users there may be a possibility that information belonging to different customers resides on same data server. Therefore, Information leakage may arise by mistake when information for one customer is given to other. Additionally, <a href="/wiki/Eugene_Schultz" title="Eugene Schultz">Eugene Schultz</a>, chief technology officer at Emagined Security, said that hackers are spending substantial time and effort looking for ways to penetrate the cloud. &quot;There are some real Achilles&apos; heels in the cloud infrastructure that are making big holes for the bad guys to get into&quot;. Because data from hundreds or thousands of companies can be stored on large cloud servers, hackers can theoretically gain control of huge stores of information through a single attack&#x2014;a process he called &quot;hyperjacking&quot;. Some examples of this include the Dropbox security breach, and iCloud 2014 leak. Dropbox had been breached in October 2014, having over 7 million of its users passwords stolen by hackers in an effort to get monetary value from it by Bitcoins (BTC). By having these passwords, they are able to read private data as well as have this data be indexed by search engines (making the information public).</p><p>There is the problem of legal ownership of the data (If a user stores some data in the cloud, can the cloud provider profit from it?). Many Terms of Service agreements are silent on the question of ownership.</p><p>Physical control of the computer equipment (private cloud) is more secure than having the equipment off site and under someone else&apos;s control (public cloud). This delivers great incentive to public cloud computing service providers to prioritize building and maintaining strong management of secure services. Some small businesses that don&apos;t have expertise in <a href="/wiki/Information_technology" title="Information technology">IT</a> security could find that it&apos;s more secure for them to use a public cloud.</p><p>There is the risk that end users don&apos;t understand the issues involved when signing on to a cloud service (persons sometimes don&apos;t read the many pages of the terms of service agreement, and just click &quot;Accept&quot; without reading). This is important now that cloud computing is becoming popular and required for some services to work, for example for an <a href="/wiki/Intelligent_personal_assistant" title="Intelligent personal assistant">intelligent personal assistant</a> (Apple&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Siri" title="Siri">Siri</a> or <a href="/wiki/Google_Now" title="Google Now">Google Now</a>).</p><p>Fundamentally private cloud is seen as more secure with higher levels of control for the owner, however public cloud is seen to be more flexible and requires less time and money investment from the user.</p><p>According to <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Schneier" title="Bruce Schneier">Bruce Schneier</a>, &quot;The downside is that you will have limited customization options. Cloud computing is cheaper because of <a href="/wiki/Economies_of_scale" title="Economies of scale">economics of scale</a>, and like any outsourced task, you tend to get what you get. A restaurant with a limited menu is cheaper than a personal chef who can cook anything you want. Fewer options at a much cheaper price: it&apos;s a feature, not a bug and the cloud provider might not meet your legal needs. As a business, you need to weigh the benefits against the risks.&quot;</p><p>Cloud computing is therefore still as much a research topic, as it is a market offering. What is clear through the evolution of cloud computing services is that the chief technical officer (CTO) is a major driving force behind cloud adoption. The major cloud technology developers continue to invest billions a year in cloud R&amp;D; for example: in 2011 Microsoft committed 90% of its US$9.6bn <a href="/wiki/Research_and_development" title="Research and development">R&amp;D</a> budget to its cloud. Centaur Partners also predict that SaaS revenue will grow from US$13.5B in 2011 to $32.8B in 2016. This expansion also includes Finance and Accounting SaaS. Additionally, more industries are turning to cloud technology as an efficient way to improve quality services due to its capabilities to reduce overhead costs, downtime, and automate infrastructure deployment.</p>
