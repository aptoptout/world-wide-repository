<p>Obama returned to Honolulu in 1971 to live with his maternal grandparents, <a href="/wiki/Madelyn_Dunham" title="Madelyn Dunham">Madelyn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stanley_Armour_Dunham" title="Stanley Armour Dunham">Stanley Dunham</a>, and with the aid of a scholarship attended <a href="/wiki/Punahou_School" title="Punahou School">Punahou School</a>, a private <a href="/wiki/University-preparatory_school" title="University-preparatory school">college preparatory school</a>, from fifth grade until his graduation from high school in 1979.

Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at Punahou when his mother and sister returned to Indonesia in 1975 so his mother could begin anthropology field work. His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a <a href="/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy" title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</a> degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following treatment for <a href="/wiki/Ovarian_cancer" title="Ovarian cancer">ovarian cancer</a> and <a href="/wiki/Uterine_cancer" title="Uterine cancer">uterine cancer</a>.</p>
<p>Of his early childhood, Obama recalled, &quot;That my father looked nothing like the people around me &#x2013; that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk &#x2013; barely registered in my mind.&quot; He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage. Reflecting later on his years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: &quot;The opportunity that Hawaii offered &#x2013; to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect &#x2013; became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.&quot; Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, <a href="/wiki/Marijuana" class="mw-redirect" title="Marijuana">marijuana</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Cocaine" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a> during his teenage years to &quot;push questions of who I was out of my mind&quot;.

In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks. Later in 1981, he transferred as a <a href="/wiki/Junior_(education)" title="Junior (education)">junior</a> to <a href="/wiki/Columbia_College,_Columbia_University" title="Columbia College, Columbia University">Columbia College, Columbia University</a>, in New York City, where he majored in <a href="/wiki/Political_science" title="Political science">political science</a> with a specialty in <a href="/wiki/International_relations" title="International relations">international relations</a> and lived off-campus on West 109th Street.

<p>In 1996, as a candidate for the Illinois state senate, Obama had said that he favored legalizing <a href="/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_the_United_States" title="Same-sex marriage in the United States">same-sex marriage</a>; but by the time of his Senate run in 2004, he said that while he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners, for strategic reasons he opposed same-sex marriages. On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for reelection as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.</p>
<p>During his second <a href="/wiki/Inaugural_address" class="mw-redirect" title="Inaugural address">inaugural address</a> on January 21, 2013, Obama became the first president to call for full equality for gay Americans: &quot;Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law &#x2013; for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.&quot; This was the first time that a president mentioned <a href="/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_United_States" title="LGBT rights in the United States">gay rights</a> or the word &quot;gay&quot; in an inaugural address. In 2013, the Obama administration filed briefs urging the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court</a> to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of <i><a href="/wiki/Hollingsworth_v._Perry" title="Hollingsworth v.

Obama presents his first <a href="//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Obama_Administration_weekly_video_addresses" class="extiw" title="commons:Obama Administration weekly video addresses">weekly address</a> as President of the United States on January 24, 2009, discussing the <a href="/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009" title="American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009</a></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>On February 17, 2009, Obama signed the <a href="/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009" title="American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009</a>, a $787&#xA0;billion <a href="/wiki/Stimulus_(economics)" title="Stimulus (economics)">economic stimulus</a> package aimed at helping the economy recover from the <a href="/wiki/Great_Recession" title="Great Recession">deepening worldwide recession</a>. The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and <a href="/wiki/Tax_incentive" title="Tax incentive">incentives</a>, and direct assistance to individuals.</p>
<p>In March, Obama&apos;s Treasury Secretary, <a href="/wiki/Timothy_Geithner" title="Timothy Geithner">Timothy Geithner</a>, took further steps to manage the <a href="/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308" title="Financial crisis of 2007&#x2013;08">financial crisis</a>, including introducing the <a href="/wiki/Public-Private_Investment_Program_for_Legacy_Assets" title="Public-Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets">Public-Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets</a>, which contains provisions for buying up to two&#xA0;trillion dollars in depreciated real estate assets. Obama intervened in the <a href="/wiki/Automotive_industry_crisis_of_2008%E2%80%9310" title="Automotive industry crisis of 2008&#x2013;10">troubled automotive industry</a> in March 2009, renewing loans for <a href="/wiki/General_Motors" title="General Motors">General Motors</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chrysler" title="Chrysler">Chrysler</a> to continue operations while reorganizing.

In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment. He signed into law the <a href="/wiki/Car_Allowance_Rebate_System" title="Car Allowance Rebate System">Car Allowance Rebate System</a>, known colloquially as &quot;Cash for Clunkers&quot;, that temporarily boosted the economy.</p>

<p>Spending and loan guarantees from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department authorized by the Bush and Obama administrations totaled about $11.5&#xA0;trillion, but only $3&#xA0;trillion was spent by the end of November 2009. Obama and the <a href="/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office" title="Congressional Budget Office">Congressional Budget Office</a> predicted the 2010 <a href="/wiki/2010_United_States_federal_budget" title="2010 United States federal budget">budget deficit</a> would be $1.5&#xA0;trillion or 10.6&#xA0;percent of the nation&apos;s gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the 2009 deficit of $1.4&#xA0;trillion or 9.9&#xA0;percent of GDP. For 2011, the administration predicted the deficit will shrink to $1.34&#xA0;trillion, and the 10-year deficit will increase to $8.53&#xA0;trillion or 90&#xA0;percent of GDP. The most recent increase in the U.S. <a href="/wiki/Debt_ceiling" class="mw-redirect" title="Debt ceiling">debt ceiling</a> to $17.2&#xA0;trillion took effect in February 2014. On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation&apos;s debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan <a href="/wiki/Budget_Control_Act_of_2011" title="Budget Control Act of 2011">Budget Control Act of 2011</a>. The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5&#xA0;trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2&#xA0;trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings. By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a <a href="/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States" title="Federal government of the United States">U.S. government</a> <a href="/wiki/Default_(finance)" title="Default (finance)">default</a> on its obligations.</p>

Employment statistics (changes in <a href="/wiki/Unemployment_rate" class="mw-redirect" title="Unemployment rate">unemployment rate</a> and net jobs per month) during Obama&apos;s tenure as U.S. President</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>As it did throughout 2008, the unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0&#xA0;percent and averaging 10.0&#xA0;percent in the fourth quarter. Following a decrease to 9.7&#xA0;percent in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6&#xA0;percent in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year. Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8&#xA0;percent, which was less than the average of 1.9&#xA0;percent experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries. By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7&#xA0;percent, decreasing to 6.7&#xA0;percent in the last month of 2013. During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3&#xA0;percent in the first quarter. GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6&#xA0;percent, followed by a 5.0&#xA0;percent increase in the fourth quarter. Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7&#xA0;percent in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year. In July 2010, the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System" title="Federal Reserve System">Federal Reserve</a> noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman <a href="/wiki/Ben_Bernanke" title="Ben Bernanke">Ben Bernanke</a> said the economic outlook was &quot;unusually uncertain&quot;. Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9&#xA0;percent in 2010.</p>
<p>The Congressional Budget Office and a broad range of economists credit Obama&apos;s stimulus plan for economic growth. The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1&#x2013;2.1&#xA0;million, while conceding that &quot;It is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package.&quot; Although an April 2010 survey of members of the <a href="/wiki/National_Association_for_Business_Economics" title="National Association for Business Economics">National Association for Business Economics</a> showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73&#xA0;percent of 68 respondents believed that the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment. The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original NATO members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>. The OECD credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus in the United States and the austerity measures in the European Union.</p>
<p>Within a month of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_elections,_2010" title="United States elections, 2010">2010 midterm elections</a>, Obama announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the <a href="/wiki/Bush_tax_cuts" title="Bush tax cuts">2001 and 2003 income tax rates</a>, a one-year <a href="/wiki/Federal_Insurance_Contributions_Act_tax" title="Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax">payroll tax</a> reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for <a href="/wiki/Estate_tax_in_the_United_States" title="Estate tax in the United States">estate taxes</a>. The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858&#xA0;billion <a href="/wiki/Tax_Relief,_Unemployment_Insurance_Reauthorization,_and_Job_Creation_Act_of_2010" title="Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010">Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010</a> passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.</p>
<p>In December 2013, Obama declared that growing <a href="/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States" title="Income inequality in the United States">income inequality</a> is a &quot;defining challenge of our time&quot; and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages.

</div>
</div>
<p>Obama called for <a href="/wiki/United_States_Congress" title="United States Congress">Congress</a> to pass legislation reforming <a href="/wiki/Health_care_in_the_United_States" title="Health care in the United States">health care in the United States</a>, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal. He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900&#xA0;billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the <a href="/wiki/Public_health_insurance_option" title="Public health insurance option">public option</a>, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for <a href="/wiki/Pre-existing_condition" title="Pre-existing condition">pre-existing conditions</a>, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.</p>
<p>On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009. After much public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered <a href="/wiki/Barack_Obama_speech_to_joint_session_of_Congress,_September_2009" title="Barack Obama speech to joint session of Congress, September 2009">a speech to a joint session of Congress</a> on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals.

<p>The ACA includes <a href="/wiki/Provisions_of_the_Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act" title="Provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act">health-related provisions</a> to take effect over four years, including expanding <a href="/wiki/Medicaid" title="Medicaid">Medicaid</a> eligibility for people making up to 133&#xA0;percent of the <a href="/wiki/Federal_poverty_level" class="mw-redirect" title="Federal poverty level">federal poverty level</a> (FPL) starting in 2014, subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400&#xA0;percent of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum &quot;out-of-pocket&quot; payment for annual premiums will be from 2 to 9.5&#xA0;percent of income, providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing <a href="/wiki/Health_insurance_exchange" class="mw-redirect" title="Health insurance exchange">health insurance exchanges</a>, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research. According to White House and Congressional Budget Office figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level.</p>
<p>The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income <a href="/wiki/Tax_bracket" title="Tax bracket">brackets</a>, taxes on <a href="/wiki/Indoor_tanning" class="mw-redirect" title="Indoor tanning">indoor tanning</a>, cuts to the <a href="/wiki/Medicare_Advantage" title="Medicare Advantage">Medicare Advantage</a> program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies; there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons. In March 2010, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143&#xA0;billion over the first decade.</p>
<p>The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5&#x2013;4 vote in <i><a href="/wiki/National_Federation_of_Independent_Business_v._Sebelius" title="National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius">National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius</a></i> that the mandate was constitutional under the U.S. Congress&apos;s taxing authority. In <i><a href="/wiki/Burwell_v._Hobby_Lobby_Stores,_Inc." title="Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.">Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</a></i> the Court ruled that &quot;closely-held&quot; for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the <a href="/wiki/Religious_Freedom_Restoration_Act" title="Religious Freedom Restoration Act">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. In June 2015, the Court ruled 6&#x2013;3 in <i><a href="/wiki/King_v._Burwell" title="King v. Burwell">King v. Burwell</a></i> that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans &quot;established by the State,&quot; as the statute reads.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Energy_policy">Energy policy</span></h4>

<p>Prior to June 2014, Obama offered substantial support for a broadly based &quot;All of the above&quot; approach to domestic energy policy which Obama has maintained since his first term and which he last confirmed at his State of the Union speech in January 2014 to a mixed reception by both parties. In June 2014, Obama made indications that his administration would consider a shift towards an energy policy more closely tuned to the manufacturing industry and its impact on the domestic economy. Obama&apos;s approach of selectively combining regulation and incentive to various issues in the domestic energy policy such as coal mining and oil fracking has received mixed commentary for not being as responsive to the needs of the domestic manufacturing sector as needed, following claims that the domestic manufacturing sector utilizes as much as a third of nation&apos;s available energy resources.</p>

International trips made by President Barack Obama during his time in office</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In February and March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State" title="United States Secretary of State">Secretary of State</a> Hillary Rodham Clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a &quot;new era&quot; in U.S. foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms &quot;break&quot; and &quot;<a href="/wiki/Russian_reset" title="Russian reset">reset</a>&quot; to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration. Obama attempted to reach out to Arab leaders by granting his first interview to an Arab cable TV network, <a href="/wiki/Al_Arabiya" title="Al Arabiya">Al Arabiya</a>.</p>
<p>On March 19, Obama continued his outreach to the Muslim world, releasing a New Year&apos;s video message to the people and government of Iran. In April, Obama gave a speech in Ankara, <a href="/wiki/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, which was well received by many Arab governments. On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech at <a href="/wiki/Cairo_University" title="Cairo University">Cairo University</a> in Egypt calling for &quot;<a href="/wiki/A_New_Beginning" title="A New Beginning">A New Beginning</a>&quot; in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace.</p>
<p>On June 26, 2009, in response to the Iranian government&apos;s actions towards protesters following <a href="/wiki/Iranian_presidential_election,_2009" title="Iranian presidential election, 2009">Iran&apos;s 2009 presidential election</a>, Obama said: &quot;The violence perpetrated against them is outrageous. We see it and we condemn it.&quot; On July 7, while in Moscow, he responded to a Vice President Biden comment on a possible Israeli military strike on Iran by saying: &quot;We have said directly to the Israelis that it is important to try and resolve this in an international setting in a way that does not create major conflict in the Middle East.&quot;</p>
<p>On September 24, 2009, Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council" title="President of the United Nations Security Council">preside</a> over a meeting of the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" title="United Nations Security Council">United Nations Security Council</a>.</p>
<p>In March 2010, Obama took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu" title="Benjamin Netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of <a href="/wiki/East_Jerusalem" title="East Jerusalem">East Jerusalem</a>.

<p>In December 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider <a href="/wiki/LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory" title="LGBT rights by country or territory">LGBT rights</a> when issuing financial aid to foreign countries. He criticized Russia&apos;s law discriminating against gays in August 2013, stopping short of advocating a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics held in Sochi, Russia.</p>
<p>In December 2014, Obama announced that he intended to <a href="/wiki/United_States%E2%80%93Cuban_Thaw" title="United States&#x2013;Cuban Thaw">normalize relationships</a> between <a href="/wiki/Cuba%E2%80%93United_States_relations" title="Cuba&#x2013;United States relations">Cuba and the United States</a>.

On August 19, 2010, the last U.S. combat brigade exited Iraq. Remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to <a href="/wiki/Counter-terrorism" title="Counter-terrorism">counter-terrorism</a> and the training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi security forces. On August 31, 2010, Obama announced that the United States combat mission in Iraq was over.

<p>In February 2011, protests in Libya began against long-time dictator <a href="/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi" title="Muammar Gaddafi">Muammar Gaddafi</a> as part of the <a href="/wiki/Arab_Spring" title="Arab Spring">Arab Spring</a>. They soon turned violent. In March, as forces loyal to Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the <a href="/wiki/Arab_League" title="Arab League">Arab League</a>, and a resolution passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate. In response to the unanimous passage of <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1973" title="United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973">United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973</a> on March 17, Gaddafi&#x2014;who had previously vowed to &quot;show no mercy&quot; to the rebels of Benghazi&#x2014;announced an immediate cessation of military activities, yet reports came in that his forces continued shelling Misrata. The next day, on Obama&apos;s orders, the U.S. military took part in air strikes to destroy the Libyan government&apos;s air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone, including the use of <a href="/wiki/Tomahawk_(missile)" title="Tomahawk (missile)">Tomahawk missiles</a>, <a href="/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_B-2_Spirit" title="Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit">B-2 Spirits</a>, and fighter jets. Six days later, on March 25, by unanimous vote of all of its 28 members, <a href="/wiki/NATO" title="NATO">NATO</a> took over leadership of the effort, dubbed <a href="/wiki/Operation_Unified_Protector" title="Operation Unified Protector">Operation Unified Protector</a>. Some Representatives questioned whether Obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Syrian_Civil_War">Syrian Civil War</span></h4>
<p>On October 18, 2011, during the early stages of the <a href="/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War" title="Syrian Civil War">Syrian Civil War</a>, Obama said that &quot;<a href="/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad" title="Bashar al-Assad">Assad</a> must go&quot;, saying that this was for the sake of the Syrian people. He reaffirmed that belief on November 19, 2015. To that end, Obama authorized an effort to train anti-Assad rebels. The program achieved minimal results, and the Obama Administration abandoned it in 2015. In the wake of a <a href="/wiki/Ghouta_chemical_attack" title="Ghouta chemical attack">chemical weapons attack</a> in Syria in 2013 widely blamed on the Assad regime, Obama insisted that Assad must give up his chemical weapons. This led to an agreement which resulted in Assad <a href="/wiki/Destruction_of_Syria%27s_chemical_weapons" title="Destruction of Syria&apos;s chemical weapons">giving up many such weapons</a>, but attacks with <a href="/wiki/Chlorine_gas" class="mw-redirect" title="Chlorine gas">chlorine gas</a> continued. In 2014, Obama authorized an <a href="/wiki/Military_intervention_against_ISIL" title="Military intervention against ISIL">air campaign aimed primarily at ISIL</a>, but repeatedly promised that the U.S. would put &quot;no boots on the ground&quot; in <a href="/wiki/Syria" title="Syria">Syria</a>.</p>

<p>Obama&apos;s family history, upbringing, and <a href="/wiki/Ivy_League" title="Ivy League">Ivy League</a> education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the <a href="/wiki/African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1954%E2%80%9368)" title="African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954&#x2013;68)">civil rights movement</a>. Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is &quot;black enough&quot;, Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the <a href="/wiki/National_Association_of_Black_Journalists" title="National Association of Black Journalists">National Association of Black Journalists</a> that &quot;we&apos;re still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong.&quot; Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: &quot;I wouldn&apos;t be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation.&quot;</p>
<p>Obama is frequently referred to as an exceptional orator. During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama has delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses. Former presidential campaign surrogate and Georgetown professor, Michael Eric Dyson, is both critical and sympathetic of President Obama&apos;s leadership in race relations indicating that speeches and action on racial disparity and justice have been somewhat reactive and reluctant when in the later part of his second term, racial violence demanded immediate presidential action and conversation.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="/wiki/Gallup_Organization" class="mw-redirect" title="Gallup Organization">Gallup Organization</a>, Obama began his presidency with a 68&#xA0;percent approval rating before gradually declining for the rest of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41&#xA0;percent in August 2010, a trend similar to <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>&apos;s and <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>&apos;s first years in office. He experienced a small poll bounce shortly after the <a href="/wiki/Death_of_Osama_bin_Laden" title="Death of Osama bin Laden">death of Osama bin Laden</a> on May 2, 2011. This bounce lasted until around June 2011, when his approval numbers dropped back to where they were previously. His approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52&#xA0;percent shortly after his second inauguration.

<p>In a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of <a href="/wiki/Family_of_Barack_Obama" title="Family of Barack Obama">his extended family</a>: &quot;It&apos;s like a little mini-United Nations&quot;, he said. &quot;I&apos;ve got relatives who look like <a href="/wiki/Bernie_Mac" title="Bernie Mac">Bernie Mac</a>, and I&apos;ve got relatives who look like <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>.&quot; Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (<a href="/wiki/Maya_Soetoro-Ng" title="Maya Soetoro-Ng">Maya Soetoro-Ng</a>, the daughter of his mother and her Indonesian second husband) and seven half-siblings from his Kenyan father&apos;s family&#x2014;six of them living.

They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992. The couple&apos;s first daughter, Malia Ann, was born on July 4, 1998, followed by a second daughter, Natasha (&quot;Sasha&quot;), on June 10, 2001. The Obama daughters attended the private <a href="/wiki/University_of_Chicago_Laboratory_Schools" title="University of Chicago Laboratory Schools">University of Chicago Laboratory Schools</a>.

<p>Obama is a Protestant Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life. He wrote in <i>The Audacity of Hope</i> that he &quot;was not raised in a religious household&quot;. He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet &quot;in many ways the most spiritually awakened person that I have ever known.&quot; He described his father as a &quot;confirmed <a href="/wiki/Atheist" class="mw-redirect" title="Atheist">atheist</a>&quot; by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as &quot;a man who saw religion as not particularly useful.&quot; Obama explained how, through working with <a href="/wiki/Black_church" title="Black church">black churches</a> as a <a href="/wiki/Community_organizing" title="Community organizing">community organizer</a> while in his twenties, he came to understand &quot;the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change.&quot;</p>
<p>In January 2008, Obama told <i><a href="/wiki/Christianity_Today" title="Christianity Today">Christianity Today</a></i>: &quot;I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and <a href="/wiki/Resurrection_of_Jesus" title="Resurrection of Jesus">resurrection of Jesus Christ</a>. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life.&quot; On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying &quot;I&apos;m a Christian by choice. My family didn&apos;t &#x2013; frankly, they weren&apos;t folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn&apos;t raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead &#x2013; being my brothers&apos; and sisters&apos; keeper, treating others as they would treat me.&quot;</p>
<p>Obama met <a href="/wiki/Trinity_United_Church_of_Christ" title="Trinity United Church of Christ">Trinity United Church of Christ</a> pastor Rev. <a href="/wiki/Jeremiah_Wright" title="Jeremiah Wright">Jeremiah Wright</a> in October 1987, and became a member of Trinity in 1992. He resigned from Trinity in May 2008 during his first presidential campaign after <a href="/wiki/Jeremiah_Wright_controversy" title="Jeremiah Wright controversy">some of Wright&apos;s statements were criticized</a>. The Obama family has attended several Protestant churches since moving to Washington, D.C. in 2009, including <a href="/wiki/Shiloh_Baptist_Church_(Washington,_D.C.)" title="Shiloh Baptist Church (Washington, D.C.)">Shiloh Baptist Church</a> and <a href="/wiki/St._John%27s_Episcopal_Church,_Lafayette_Square" title="St. John&apos;s Episcopal Church, Lafayette Square">St. John&apos;s Episcopal Church</a>.
