The expanse of the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside of the directly controlled Empire, though by the end of the nineteenth century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage. In 1888, <a href="/wiki/The_Football_League" title="The Football League">The Football League</a> was founded in England, becoming the first of many <a href="/wiki/Professional_sports" title="Professional sports">professional</a> football competitions.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Common_elements">Common elements</span></h2>
<p>The various codes of football share certain common elements. Players in American football, Canadian football, rugby union and rugby league take up positions in a limited area of the field at the start of the game. They tend to use throwing and running as the main ways of moving the ball, and only kick on certain limited occasions. <a href="/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)" title="Tackle (football move)">Body tackling</a> is a major skill, and games typically involve short passages of play of 5&#x2013;90 seconds.</p>
<p>Association football, Australian rules football and Gaelic football tend to use kicking to move the ball around the pitch, with handling more limited. Body tackles are less central to the game, and players are freer to move around the field (<i><a href="/wiki/Offside_(sport)" title="Offside (sport)">offside</a></i> laws are typically less strict).</p>
<p>Common rules among the sports include:</p>

<p>In all codes, common skills include <a href="/wiki/Passing_(sports)" title="Passing (sports)">passing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)" title="Tackle (football move)">tackling</a>, evasion of tackles, catching and <a href="/wiki/Kick_(football)" title="Kick (football)">kicking</a>. In most codes, there are rules restricting the movement of players <i><a href="/wiki/Offside_(sport)" title="Offside (sport)">offside</a></i>, and players scoring a goal must put the ball either under or over a <i><a href="/wiki/Goal_(sport)" title="Goal (sport)">crossbar</a></i> between the goalposts.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>

<p>There are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word &quot;football&quot;. It is widely assumed that the word &quot;football&quot; (or the phrase &quot;foot ball&quot;) refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball. There is an alternative explanation, which is that football originally referred to a variety of games in <a href="/wiki/Medieval_Europe" class="mw-redirect" title="Medieval Europe">medieval Europe</a>, which were played <i>on foot</i>. There is no conclusive evidence for either explanation.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greeks</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a> are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet. The Roman game <i><a href="/wiki/Harpastum" title="Harpastum">harpastum</a></i> is believed to have been adapted from a <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">Greek</a> team game known as &quot;&#x1F10;&#x3C0;&#x3AF;&#x3C3;&#x3BA;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;&quot; (<i><a href="/wiki/Episkyros" title="Episkyros">Episkyros</a></i>) or &quot;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3AF;&#x3BD;&#x3B4;&#x3B1;&quot; (<i>phaininda</i>), which is mentioned by a Greek playwright, <a href="/wiki/Antiphanes_of_Berge" title="Antiphanes of Berge">Antiphanes</a> (388&#x2013;311&#xA0;BC) and later referred to by the <a href="/wiki/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christian</a> theologian <a href="/wiki/Clement_of_Alexandria" title="Clement of Alexandria">Clement of Alexandria</a> (c. 150 &#x2013; c. 215&#xA0;AD). These games appear to have resembled <a href="/wiki/Rugby_football" title="Rugby football">rugby football</a>. The Roman politician <a href="/wiki/Cicero" title="Cicero">Cicero</a> (106&#x2013;43&#xA0;BC) describes the case of a man who was killed whilst having a shave when a ball was kicked into a barber&apos;s shop. Roman ball games already knew the air-filled ball, the <a href="/wiki/Follis_(ball_game)" class="mw-redirect" title="Follis (ball game)">follis</a>. <i>Episkyros</i> is recognised as an early form of football by FIFA.</p>
<p>A Chinese game called Tsu&apos; Chu, <a href="/wiki/Cuju" title="Cuju">Cuju</a> or Zuqiu has been recognised by <a href="/wiki/FIFA" title="FIFA">FIFA</a> as the first version of the game with regular rules. It existed during the <a href="/wiki/Han_Dynasty" class="mw-redirect" title="Han Dynasty">Han Dynasty</a>, the second and third centuries BC. The Japanese version of <i>cuju</i> is <i><a href="/wiki/Kemari" title="Kemari">kemari</a></i> (&#x8E74;&#x97A0;), and was developed during the <a href="/wiki/Asuka_period" title="Asuka period">Asuka period</a>. This is known to have been played within the Japanese imperial court in <a href="/wiki/Kyoto" title="Kyoto">Kyoto</a> from about 600&#xA0;AD. In <i>kemari</i> several people stand in a circle and kick a ball to each other, trying not to let the ball drop to the ground (much like <a href="/wiki/Keepie_uppie" title="Keepie uppie">keepie uppie</a>). The game appears to have died out sometime before the mid-19th century. It was revived in 1903 and is now played at a number of festivals.</p>
<p>There are a number of references to <a href="/wiki/Tradition" title="Tradition">traditional</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ancient" class="mw-redirect" title="Ancient">ancient</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Prehistoric" class="mw-redirect" title="Prehistoric">prehistoric</a> ball games, played by <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_peoples" title="Indigenous peoples">indigenous peoples</a> in many different parts of the world. For example, in 1586, men from a ship commanded by an English explorer named <a href="/wiki/John_Davis_(English_explorer)" title="John Davis (English explorer)">John Davis</a>, went ashore to play a form of football with <a href="/wiki/Inuit" title="Inuit">Inuit</a> (Eskimo) people in <a href="/wiki/Greenland" title="Greenland">Greenland</a>. There are later accounts of an Inuit game played on ice, called <i>Aqsaqtuk</i>. Each match began with two teams facing each other in parallel lines, before attempting to kick the ball through each other team&apos;s line and then at a goal. In 1610, <a href="/wiki/William_Strachey" title="William Strachey">William Strachey</a>, a colonist at <a href="/wiki/Jamestown,_Virginia" title="Jamestown, Virginia">Jamestown, Virginia</a> recorded a game played by <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="Native Americans in the United States">Native Americans</a>, called <i>Pahsaheman</i>. On the <a href="/wiki/Australian_continent" class="mw-redirect" title="Australian continent">Australian continent</a> several tribes of <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" title="Indigenous Australians">indigenous people</a> played kicking and catching games with stuffed balls which have been generalised by historians as <i><a href="/wiki/Marn_Grook" title="Marn Grook">Marn Grook</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/Djab_Wurrung" class="mw-redirect" title="Djab Wurrung">Djab Wurrung</a> for &quot;game ball&quot;). The earliest historical account is an <a href="/wiki/Anecdote" title="Anecdote">anecdote</a> from the 1878 book by <a href="/wiki/Robert_Brough-Smyth" class="mw-redirect" title="Robert Brough-Smyth">Robert Brough-Smyth</a>, <i>The Aborigines of Victoria</i>, in which a man called Richard Thomas is quoted as saying, in about 1841 in <a href="/wiki/Victoria,_Australia" class="mw-redirect" title="Victoria, Australia">Victoria, Australia</a>, that he had witnessed Aboriginal people playing the game: &quot;Mr Thomas describes how the foremost player will drop kick a ball made from the skin of a <a href="/wiki/Possum" title="Possum">possum</a> and how other players leap into the air in order to catch it.&quot; Some historians have theorised that <i>Marn Grook</i> was one of the <a href="/wiki/Origins_of_Australian_football" class="mw-redirect" title="Origins of Australian football">origins of</a> <a href="/wiki/Australian_rules_football" title="Australian rules football">Australian rules football</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/M%C4%81ori_people" title="M&#x101;ori people">M&#x101;ori</a> in New Zealand played a game called <a href="/wiki/Ki-o-rahi" title="Ki-o-rahi">Ki-o-rahi</a> consisting of teams of seven players play on a circular field divided into zones, and score points by touching the &apos;pou&apos; (boundary markers) and hitting a central &apos;tupu&apos; or target.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Mesoamerican_ballgame" title="Mesoamerican ballgame">Games played in Mesoamerica</a> with rubber balls by <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" title="Indigenous peoples of the Americas">indigenous peoples</a> are also well-documented as existing since before this time, but these had more similarities to <a href="/wiki/Basketball" title="Basketball">basketball</a> or <a href="/wiki/Volleyball" title="Volleyball">volleyball</a>, and since their influence on modern football games is minimal, most do not class them as football.Northeastern American Indians, especially the <a href="/wiki/Iroquois" title="Iroquois">Iroquois</a> Confederation, played a game which made use of net racquets to throw and catch a small ball; however, although it is a ball-goal foot game, <a href="/wiki/Lacrosse" title="Lacrosse">lacrosse</a> (as its modern descendant is called) is likewise not usually classed as a form of &quot;football.&quot;</p>
<p>These games and others may well go far back into antiquity. However, the main sources of modern football codes appear to lie in western Europe, especially England.</p>

<p>The early forms of football played in England, sometimes referred to as &quot;<a href="/wiki/Mob_football" class="mw-redirect" title="Mob football">mob football</a>&quot;, would be played between neighbouring towns and villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams who would clash <i>en masse</i>, struggling to move an item, such as inflated animal&apos;s bladder to particular geographical points, such as their opponents&apos; church, with play taking place in the open space between neighbouring parishes. The game was played primarily during significant religious festivals, such as Shrovetide, <a href="/wiki/Christmas" title="Christmas">Christmas</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Easter" title="Easter">Easter</a>, and Shrovetide games have survived into the modern era in a number of English towns (see below).</p>
<p>The first detailed description of what was almost certainly football in England was given by <a href="/wiki/William_FitzStephen" class="mw-redirect" title="William FitzStephen">William FitzStephen</a> in about 1174&#x2013;1183. He described the activities of London youths during the annual festival of <a href="/wiki/Shrove_Tuesday" title="Shrove Tuesday">Shrove Tuesday</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>After lunch all the youth of the city go out into the fields to take part in a ball game. The students of each school have their own ball; the workers from each city craft are also carrying their balls. Older citizens, fathers, and wealthy citizens come on horseback to watch their juniors competing, and to relive their own youth vicariously: you can see their inner passions aroused as they watch the action and get caught up in the fun being had by the carefree adolescents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the very early references to the game speak simply of &quot;ball play&quot; or &quot;playing at ball&quot;. This reinforces the idea that the games played at the time did not necessarily involve a ball being kicked.</p>
<p>An early reference to a ball game that was probably football comes from 1280 at <a href="/wiki/Ulgham" title="Ulgham">Ulgham</a>, <a href="/wiki/Northumberland" title="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>, England: &quot;Henry... while playing at ball.. ran against David&quot;. Football was played in Ireland in 1308, with a documented reference to John McCrocan, a spectator at a &quot;football game&quot; at <a href="/wiki/Newcastle,_County_Down" title="Newcastle, County Down">Newcastle, County Down</a> being charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard. Another reference to a football game comes in 1321 at <a href="/wiki/Shouldham" title="Shouldham">Shouldham</a>, <a href="/wiki/Norfolk" title="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>, England: &quot;[d]uring the game at ball as he kicked the ball, a lay friend of his... ran against him and wounded himself&quot;.</p>
<p>In 1314, <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_de_Farndone" title="Nicholas de Farndone">Nicholas de Farndone</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lord_Mayor_of_the_City_of_London" class="mw-redirect" title="Lord Mayor of the City of London">Lord Mayor of the City of London</a> issued a decree banning football in the French used by the English upper classes at the time. A translation reads: &quot;[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large foot balls [<i>rageries de grosses pelotes de pee</i>] in the fields of the public from which many evils might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future.&quot; This is the earliest reference to football.</p>
<p>In 1363, King <a href="/wiki/Edward_III_of_England" title="Edward III of England">Edward III of England</a> issued a proclamation banning &quot;...handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games&quot;, showing that &quot;football&quot; &#x2013; whatever its exact form in this case &#x2013; was being differentiated from games involving other parts of the body, such as handball.</p>
<p>A game known as &quot;football&quot; was played in Scotland as early as the 15th century: it was prohibited by the Football Act 1424 and although the law fell into disuse it was not repealed until 1906. There is evidence for schoolboys playing a &quot;football&quot; ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some references cite 1636) which is notable as an early allusion to what some have considered to be passing the ball. The word &quot;pass&quot; in the most recent translation is derived from &quot;huc percute&quot; (strike it here) and later &quot;repercute pilam&quot; (strike the ball again) in the original Latin. It is not certain that the ball was being struck between members of the same team. The original word translated as &quot;goal&quot; is &quot;metum&quot;, literally meaning the &quot;pillar at each end of the circus course&quot; in a Roman chariot race. There is a reference to &quot;get hold of the ball before [another player] does&quot; (Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed. One sentence states in the original 1930 translation &quot;Throw yourself against him&quot; (Age, objice te illi).</p>

<p>In the 16th century, the city of <a href="/wiki/Florence" title="Florence">Florence</a> celebrated the period between <a href="/wiki/Epiphany_(feast)" class="mw-redirect" title="Epiphany (feast)">Epiphany</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lent" title="Lent">Lent</a> by playing a game which today is known as &quot;<i>calcio storico</i>&quot; (&quot;historic kickball&quot;) in the <a href="/wiki/Piazza_Santa_Croce" title="Piazza Santa Croce">Piazza Santa Croce</a>. The young aristocrats of the city would dress up in fine silk costumes and embroil themselves in a violent form of football. For example, <i>calcio</i> players could punch, shoulder charge, and kick opponents. Blows below the belt were allowed. The game is said to have originated as a military training exercise. In 1580, Count Giovanni de&apos; Bardi di Vernio wrote <i>Discorso sopra &apos;l giuoco del Calcio Fiorentino</i>. This is sometimes said to be the earliest code of rules for any football game. The game was not played after January 1739 (until it was revived in May 1930).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Official_disapproval_and_attempts_to_ban_football">Official disapproval and attempts to ban football</span></h3>

<p>There have been many attempts to ban football, from the <a href="/wiki/Middle_ages" class="mw-redirect" title="Middle ages">middle ages</a> through to the modern day. The first such law was passed in England in 1314; it was followed by more than 30 in England alone between 1314 and 1667. Football faced armed opposition in the 18th Century when used as a cover for violent protest against the <a href="/wiki/Enclosure_act" class="mw-redirect" title="Enclosure act">enclosure act</a>. Women were banned from playing at English and Scottish Football League grounds in 1921, a ban that was only lifted in the 1970s.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="English_public_schools">English public schools</span></h3>

<p>While football continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain, its <a href="/wiki/Public_school_(England)" class="mw-redirect" title="Public school (England)">public schools</a> (known as private schools in other countries) are widely credited with four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes. First of all, the evidence suggests that they were important in taking football away from its &quot;mob&quot; form and turning it into an organised team sport. Second, many early descriptions of football and references to it were recorded by people who had studied at these schools. Third, it was teachers, students and former students from these schools who first codified football games, to enable matches to be played between schools. Finally, it was at English public schools that the division between &quot;kicking&quot; and &quot;running&quot; (or &quot;carrying&quot;) games first became clear.</p>
<p>The earliest evidence that games resembling football were being played at English public schools &#x2013; mainly attended by boys from the upper, upper-middle and professional classes &#x2013; comes from the <i>Vulgaria</i> by William Herman in 1519. Herman had been headmaster at <a href="/wiki/Eton_College" title="Eton College">Eton</a> and <a href="/wiki/Winchester_College" title="Winchester College">Winchester</a> colleges and his <a href="/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase &quot;We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Richard_Mulcaster" title="Richard Mulcaster">Richard Mulcaster</a>, a student at <a href="/wiki/Eton_College" title="Eton College">Eton College</a> in the early 16th century and later headmaster at other English schools, has been described as &quot;the greatest sixteenth Century advocate of football&quot;. Among his contributions are the earliest evidence of organised team football. Mulcaster&apos;s writings refer to teams (&quot;sides&quot; and &quot;parties&quot;), positions (&quot;standings&quot;), a referee (&quot;judge over the parties&quot;) and a coach &quot;(trayning maister)&quot;. Mulcaster&apos;s &quot;footeball&quot; had evolved from the disordered and violent forms of traditional football:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>[s]ome smaller number with such overlooking, sorted into sides and standings, not meeting with their bodies so boisterously to trie their strength: nor shouldring or shuffing one an other so barbarously ... may use footeball for as much good to the body, by the chiefe use of the legges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1633, <a href="/wiki/David_Wedderburn_(writer)" title="David Wedderburn (writer)">David Wedderburn</a>, a teacher from <a href="/wiki/Aberdeen" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, mentioned elements of modern football games in a short <a href="/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> textbook called <i>Vocabula.</i> Wedderburn refers to what has been translated into modern English as &quot;keeping goal&quot; and makes an allusion to passing the ball (&quot;strike it here&quot;). There is a reference to &quot;get hold of the ball&quot;, suggesting that some handling was allowed. It is clear that the tackles allowed included the charging and holding of opposing players (&quot;drive that man back&quot;).</p>
<p>A more detailed description of football is given in <a href="/wiki/Francis_Willughby" title="Francis Willughby">Francis Willughby</a>&apos;s <i>Book of Games</i>, written in about 1660. Willughby, who had studied at <a href="/wiki/Bishop_Vesey%27s_Grammar_School" title="Bishop Vesey&apos;s Grammar School">Bishop Vesey&apos;s Grammar School</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sutton_Coldfield" title="Sutton Coldfield">Sutton Coldfield</a>, is the first to describe goals and a distinct playing field: &quot;a close that has a gate at either end. The gates are called Goals.&quot; His book includes a diagram illustrating a football field. He also mentions tactics (&quot;leaving some of their best players to guard the goal&quot;); scoring (&quot;they that can strike the ball through their opponents&apos; goal first win&quot;) and the way teams were selected (&quot;the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness&quot;). He is the first to describe a &quot;law&quot; of football: &quot;they must not strike [an opponent&apos;s leg] higher than the ball&quot;.</p>
<p>English public schools were the first to codify football games. In particular, they devised the first <i><a href="/wiki/Offside_(sport)" title="Offside (sport)">offside</a></i> rules, during the late 18th century. In the earliest manifestations of these rules, players were &quot;off their side&quot; if they simply stood between the ball and the goal which was their objective. Players were not allowed to pass the ball forward, either by foot or by hand. They could only dribble with their feet, or advance the ball in a <i><a href="/wiki/Scrum_(rugby)" title="Scrum (rugby)">scrum</a></i> or similar <i>formation</i>. However, offside laws began to diverge and develop differently at each school, as is shown by the rules of football from Winchester, <a href="/wiki/Rugby_School" title="Rugby School">Rugby</a>, <a href="/wiki/Harrow_School" title="Harrow School">Harrow</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cheltenham_School" class="mw-redirect" title="Cheltenham School">Cheltenham</a>, during between 1810 and 1850. The first known codes &#x2013; in the sense of a set of rules &#x2013; were those of Eton in 1815  and <a href="/wiki/Aldenham" title="Aldenham">Aldenham</a> in 1825.)</p>
<p>During the early 19th century, most <a href="/wiki/Working_class" title="Working class">working class</a> people in Britain had to work six days a week, often for over twelve hours a day. They had neither the time nor the inclination to engage in sport for recreation and, at the time, many <a href="/wiki/Child_labour#Industrial_Revolution" title="Child labour">children were part of the labour force</a>. <a href="/wiki/Feast_day" class="mw-redirect" title="Feast day">Feast day</a> football played on the streets was in decline. Public school boys, who enjoyed some freedom from work, became the inventors of organised football games with formal codes of rules.</p>
<p>Football was adopted by a number of public schools as a way of encouraging competitiveness and keeping youths fit. Each school drafted its own rules, which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils. Two schools of thought developed regarding rules. Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby, <a href="/wiki/Marlborough_College" title="Marlborough College">Marlborough</a> and Cheltenham), while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted (as at Eton, Harrow, <a href="/wiki/Westminster_School" title="Westminster School">Westminster</a> and <a href="/wiki/Charterhouse_School" title="Charterhouse School">Charterhouse</a>). The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played. For example, Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas; the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the school <a href="/wiki/Cloisters" class="mw-redirect" title="Cloisters">cloisters</a>, making it difficult for them to adopt rough and tumble running games.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/William_Webb_Ellis" title="William Webb Ellis">William Webb Ellis</a>, a pupil at Rugby School, is said to have &quot;with a fine disregard for the rules of football, <i>as played in his time</i> [emphasis added], first took the ball in his arms and ran with it, thus creating the distinctive feature of the rugby game.&quot; in 1823. This act is usually said to be the beginning of Rugby football, but there is little evidence that it occurred, and most sports historians believe the story to be apocryphal. The act of &apos;taking the ball in his arms&apos; is often misinterpreted as &apos;picking the ball up&apos; as it is widely believed that Webb Ellis&apos; &apos;crime&apos; was handling the ball, as in modern soccer, however handling the ball at the time was often permitted and in some cases compulsory, the rule for which Webb Ellis showed disregard was <i>running forward with it</i> as the rules of his time only allowed a player to retreat backwards or kick forwards.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Railway_Mania" title="Railway Mania">The boom in rail transport in Britain</a> during the 1840s meant that people were able to travel further and with less inconvenience than they ever had before. Inter-school sporting competitions became possible. However, it was difficult for schools to play each other at football, as each school played by its own rules. The solution to this problem was usually that the match be divided into two halves, one half played by the rules of the host &quot;home&quot; school, and the other half by the visiting &quot;away&quot; school.</p>
<p>The <i>modern</i> rules of many football codes were formulated during the mid- or late- 19th century. This also applies to other sports such as lawn bowls, lawn tennis, etc. The major impetus for this was the patenting of the world&apos;s first <a href="/wiki/Lawnmower" class="mw-redirect" title="Lawnmower">lawnmower</a> in 1830. This allowed for the preparation of modern ovals, playing fields, pitches, grass courts, etc.</p>
<p>Apart from Rugby football, the public school codes have barely been played beyond the confines of each school&apos;s playing fields. However, many of them are still played at the schools which created them (see <a href="/wiki/Football#Surviving_UK_school_games" title="Football">Surviving UK school games</a> below).</p>
<p>Public schools&apos; dominance of sports in the UK began to wane after the <a href="/wiki/Factory_Act_1850" class="mw-redirect" title="Factory Act 1850"><i>Factory Act</i> of 1850</a>, which significantly increased the recreation time available to working class children. Before 1850, many British children had to work six days a week, for more than twelve hours a day. From 1850, they could not work before 6&#xA0;a.m. (7&#xA0;a.m. in winter) or after 6&#xA0;p.m. on weekdays (7&#xA0;p.m. in winter); on Saturdays they had to cease work at 2&#xA0;p.m. These changes mean that working class children had more time for games, including various forms of football.</p>

<p>Sports clubs dedicated to playing football began in the 18th century, for example <a href="/wiki/The_Gymnastic_Society" title="The Gymnastic Society">London&apos;s Gymnastic Society</a> which was founded in the mid-18th century and ceased playing matches in 1796.</p>

The club forbade tripping but allowed pushing and holding and the picking up of the ball.</p>
<p>In 1845, three boys at Rugby school were tasked with codifying the rules then being used at the school. These were the first set of written rules (or code) for any form of football. This further assisted the spread of the Rugby game.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Modern_ball_passing_tactics">Modern ball passing tactics</span></h4>

<p>The earliest reference to a game of football involving players passing the ball and attempting to score past a goalkeeper was written in 1633 by David Wedderburn, a poet and teacher in <a href="/wiki/Aberdeen" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. Nevertheless, the original text does not state whether the allusion to passing as &apos;kick the ball back&apos; (&apos;Repercute pilam&apos;) was in a forward or backward direction or between members of the same opposing teams (as was usual at this time)</p>
<p>&quot;Scientific&quot; football is first recorded in 1839 from <a href="/wiki/Lancashire" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> and in the modern game in Rugby football from 1862 and from Sheffield FC as early as 1865. The first side to play a passing <a href="/wiki/Combination_game" class="mw-redirect" title="Combination game">combination game</a> was the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Engineers_AFC" class="mw-redirect" title="Royal Engineers AFC">Royal Engineers AFC</a> in 1869/70 By 1869 they were &quot;work[ing] well together&quot;, &quot;backing up&quot; and benefiting from &quot;cooperation&quot;. By 1870 the Engineers were passing the ball: &quot;Lieut. Creswell, who having brought the ball up the side then kicked it into the middle to another of his side, who kicked it through the posts the minute before time was called&quot; Passing was a regular feature of their style By early 1872 the Engineers were the first football team renowned for &quot;play[ing] beautifully together&quot; A double pass is first reported from Derby school against <a href="/wiki/Nottingham_Forest" class="mw-redirect" title="Nottingham Forest">Nottingham Forest</a> in March 1872, the first of which is irrefutably a <i>short</i> pass: &quot;Mr Absey dribbling the ball half the length of the field delivered it to Wallis, who kicking it cleverly in front of the goal, sent it to the captain who drove it at once between the Nottingham posts&quot; The first side to have perfected the modern formation was <a href="/wiki/Cambridge_University_AFC" class="mw-redirect" title="Cambridge University AFC">Cambridge University AFC</a> and introduced the 2&#x2013;3&#x2013;5 &quot;pyramid&quot; formation.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cambridge_rules">Cambridge rules</span></h3>

<p>In 1848, at <a href="/wiki/University_of_Cambridge" title="University of Cambridge">Cambridge University</a>, <a href="/wiki/H._de_Winton_and_J._C._Thring" title="H. de Winton and J. C.

An eight-hour meeting produced what amounted to the first set of modern rules, known as the <i>Cambridge rules</i>. No copy of these rules now exists, but a revised version from circa 1856 is held in the library of Shrewsbury School. The rules clearly favour the kicking game. Handling was only allowed <i>when a player catches the ball directly from the foot</i> entitling them to a free kick and there was a primitive offside rule, disallowing players from &quot;loitering&quot; around the opponents&apos; goal. The Cambridge rules were not widely adopted outside English public schools and universities (but it was arguably the most significant influence on <a href="/wiki/The_Football_Association" title="The Football Association">the Football Association</a> committee members responsible for formulating the rules of <a href="/wiki/Association_football" title="Association football">Association football</a>).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sheffield_rules">Sheffield rules</span></h3>

<p>By the late 1850s, many football clubs had been formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various codes of football. <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_F.C." title="Sheffield F.C.">Sheffield Football Club</a>, founded in 1857 in the English city of <a href="/wiki/Sheffield" title="Sheffield">Sheffield</a> by Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest, was later recognised as the world&apos;s oldest club playing association football. However, the club initially played its own code of football: the <i>Sheffield rules</i>. The code was largely independent of the public school rules, the most significant difference being the lack of an <i>offside</i> rule.</p>
<p>The code was responsible for many innovations that later spread to association football. These included <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/free_kick" class="extiw" title="wikt:free kick">free kicks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Corner_kick" title="Corner kick">corner kicks</a>, handball, <a href="/wiki/Throw-in" title="Throw-in">throw-ins</a> and the crossbar. By the 1870s they became the dominant code in the north and midlands of England.

<a href="/wiki/Tom_Wills" title="Tom Wills">Tom Wills</a>, widely regarded as the father of Australian football</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>There is archival evidence of &quot;foot-ball&quot; games being played in various parts of Australia throughout the first half of the 19th century. The origins of an organised game of football known today as Australian rules football can be traced back to 1858 in <a href="/wiki/Melbourne" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, the capital city of <a href="/wiki/Victoria_(state)" class="mw-redirect" title="Victoria (state)">Victoria</a>.</p>
<p>In July 1858, <a href="/wiki/Tom_Wills" title="Tom Wills">Tom Wills</a>, an Australian-born cricketer educated at <a href="/wiki/Rugby_School" title="Rugby School">Rugby School</a> in England, wrote a letter to <i><a href="/wiki/Bell%27s_Life_in_Victoria" class="mw-redirect" title="Bell&apos;s Life in Victoria">Bell&apos;s Life in Victoria &amp; Sporting Chronicle</a></i>, calling for a &quot;foot-ball club&quot; with a &quot;code of laws&quot; to keep cricketers fit during winter. This is considered by historians to be a defining moment in the creation of Australian rules football. Through publicity and personal contacts Wills was able to co-ordinate football matches in Melbourne that experimented with various rules, the first of which was played on July 31, 1858. One week later, Wills umpired a schoolboys match between <a href="/wiki/Melbourne_Grammar_School" title="Melbourne Grammar School">Melbourne Grammar School</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scotch_College_(Melbourne)" class="mw-redirect" title="Scotch College (Melbourne)">Scotch College</a>.

<p>Wills and others involved in these early matches formed the <a href="/wiki/Melbourne_Football_Club" title="Melbourne Football Club">Melbourne Football Club</a> (the oldest surviving Australian football club) on May 14, 1859. Club members Wills, <a href="/wiki/William_Hammersley" title="William Hammersley">William Hammersley</a>, <a href="/wiki/J._B._Thompson" title="J. B. Thompson">J. B. Thompson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_H._Smith" title="Thomas H. Smith">Thomas H. Smith</a> met with the intention of forming a set of rules that would be widely adopted by other clubs. The committee debated rules used in English public school games; Wills pushed for various <a href="/wiki/Rugby_football" title="Rugby football">rugby football</a> rules he learnt during his schooling. The first rules share similarities with these games, and were shaped to suit to Australian conditions. <a href="/wiki/H._C._A._Harrison" title="H. C. A. Harrison">H. C. A. Harrison</a>, a seminal figure in Australian football, recalled that his cousin Wills wanted &quot;a game of our own&quot;. The code was distinctive in the prevalence of the <a href="/wiki/Mark_(Australian_football)" title="Mark (Australian football)">mark</a>, <a href="/wiki/Free_kick_(Australian_rules_football)" title="Free kick (Australian rules football)">free kick</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)#Australian_rules_football" title="Tackle (football move)">tackling</a>, lack of an offside rule and that players were specifically penalised for <a href="/wiki/Handball_(Australian_rules_football)" title="Handball (Australian rules football)">throwing the ball</a>.</p>
<p>The Melbourne football rules were widely distributed and gradually adopted by the other Victorian clubs. The rules were updated several times during the 1860s to accommodate the rules of other influential Victorian football clubs. A significant redraft in 1866 by H. C. A. Harrison&apos;s committee accommodated the <a href="/wiki/Geelong_Football_Club" title="Geelong Football Club">Geelong Football Club</a>&apos;s rules, making the game then known as &quot;Victorian Rules&quot; increasingly distinct from other codes. It soon adopted cricket fields and an oval ball, used specialised goal and behind posts, and featured <a href="/wiki/Running_bounce" title="Running bounce">bouncing the ball while running</a> and <a href="/wiki/Specky" class="mw-redirect" title="Specky">spectacular high marking</a>. The game spread quickly to other <a href="/wiki/Australian_states_and_territories" class="mw-redirect" title="Australian states and territories">Australian colonies</a>.

<p>During the early 1860s, there were increasing attempts in England to unify and reconcile the various public school games. In 1862, J. C. Thring, who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules, was a master at <a href="/wiki/Uppingham_School" title="Uppingham School">Uppingham School</a> and he issued his own rules of what he called &quot;The Simplest Game&quot; (these are also known as the Uppingham Rules). In early October 1863 another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules was drawn up by a seven member committee representing former pupils from Harrow, Shrewsbury, Eton, Rugby, Marlborough and Westminster.</p>
<p>At the <a href="/wiki/Freemasons%27_Tavern" class="mw-redirect" title="Freemasons&apos; Tavern">Freemasons&apos; Tavern</a>, Great Queen Street, London on the evening of October 26, 1863, representatives of several football clubs in the <a href="/wiki/County_of_London" title="County of London">London Metropolitan area</a> met for the inaugural meeting of <a href="/wiki/The_Football_Association" title="The Football Association">The Football Association</a> (FA). The aim of the Association was to establish a single unifying code and regulate the playing of the game among its members. Following the first meeting, the public schools were invited to join the association. All of them declined, except Charterhouse and Uppingham. In total, six meetings of the FA were held between October and December 1863. After the third meeting, a draft set of rules were published. However, at the beginning of the fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the recently published Cambridge Rules of 1863. The Cambridge rules differed from the draft FA rules in two significant areas; namely running with (carrying) the ball and <a href="/wiki/Hacking_(rugby)" title="Hacking (rugby)">hacking</a> (kicking opposing players in the shins). The two contentious FA rules were as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>IX. A player shall be entitled to run with the ball towards his adversaries&apos; goal if he makes a fair catch, or catches the ball on the first bound; but in case of a fair catch, if he makes his mark he shall not run.<br></p>
<p>X. If any player shall run with the ball towards his adversaries&apos; goal, any player on the opposite side shall be at liberty to charge, hold, trip or hack him, or to wrest the ball from him, but no player shall be held and hacked at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the fifth meeting it was proposed that these two rules be removed. Most of the delegates supported this, but <a href="/wiki/F._M._Campbell" class="mw-redirect" title="F. M. Campbell">F. M. Campbell</a>, the representative from <a href="/wiki/Blackheath_Rugby_Club" class="mw-redirect" title="Blackheath Rugby Club">Blackheath</a> and the first FA treasurer, objected. He said: &quot;hacking is the true football&quot;. However, the motion to ban running with the ball in hand and hacking was carried and Blackheath withdrew from the FA. After the final meeting on 8 December, the FA published the &quot;<a href="/wiki/Laws_of_the_Game_(association_football)" title="Laws of the Game (association football)">Laws of Football</a>&quot;, the first comprehensive set of rules for the game later known as <a href="/wiki/Association_football" title="Association football">Association Football</a>. The term &quot;soccer&quot;, in use since the late 19th century, derives from an <a href="/wiki/Oxford_%22-er%22" title="Oxford &quot;-er&quot;">Oxford University abbreviation</a> of &quot;Association&quot;.</p>
<p>The first FA rules still contained elements that are no longer part of association football, but which are still recognisable in other games (such as Australian football and rugby football): for instance, a player could make a fair catch and claim a <i><a href="/wiki/Mark_(Australian_football)" title="Mark (Australian football)">mark</a></i>, which entitled him to a free kick; and if a player touched the ball behind the opponents&apos; goal line, his side was entitled to a <i>free kick</i> at goal, from 15&#xA0;yards (13.5&#xA0;metres) in front of the goal line.</p>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland">Britain</a>, by 1870, there were about 75 clubs playing variations of the Rugby school game. There were also &quot;rugby&quot; clubs in Ireland, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. However, there was no generally accepted set of rules for rugby until 1871, when 21 clubs from London came together to form the <a href="/wiki/Rugby_Football_Union" title="Rugby Football Union">Rugby Football Union</a> (RFU). The first official RFU rules were adopted in June 1871. These rules allowed passing the ball. They also included the <a href="/wiki/Try" title="Try">try</a>, where touching the ball over the line allowed an attempt at goal, though drop-goals from marks and general play, and penalty conversions were still the main form of contest.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="North_American_football_codes">North American football codes</span></h3>

<p>As was the case in Britain, by the early 19th century, North American schools and universities played their own local games, between sides made up of students. For example, students at <a href="/wiki/Dartmouth_College" title="Dartmouth College">Dartmouth College</a> in <a href="/wiki/New_Hampshire" title="New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a> played a game called <a href="/wiki/Old_division_football" title="Old division football">Old division football</a>, a variant of the association football codes, as early as the 1820s. They remained largely &quot;<a href="/wiki/Mob_football" class="mw-redirect" title="Mob football">mob football</a>&quot; style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary. Rules were simple, violence and injury were common. The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them. <a href="/wiki/Yale_University" title="Yale University">Yale University</a>, under pressure from the city of <a href="/wiki/New_Haven,_Connecticut" title="New Haven, Connecticut">New Haven</a>, banned the play of all forms of football in 1860, while <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> followed suit in 1861. In its place, two general types of football evolved: &quot;kicking&quot; games and &quot;running&quot; (or &quot;carrying&quot;) games. A hybrid of the two, known as the &quot;<a href="/w/index.php?title=Boston_Game&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Boston Game (page does not exist)">Boston game</a>&quot;, was played by a group known as the <a href="/wiki/Oneida_Football_Club" title="Oneida Football Club">Oneida Football Club</a>. The club, considered by some historians as the first formal <a href="/wiki/Football_club" class="mw-redirect" title="Football club">football club</a> in the United States, was formed in 1862 by schoolboys who played the &quot;Boston game&quot; on <a href="/wiki/Boston_Common" title="Boston Common">Boston Common</a>. The game began to return to American college campuses by the late 1860s.

<p>In Canada, the first documented football match was a practice game played on November 9, 1861, at <a href="/wiki/University_College,_University_of_Toronto" class="mw-redirect" title="University College, University of Toronto">University College, University of Toronto</a> (approximately 400 yards west of Queen&apos;s Park).

<p>On November 6, 1869, Rutgers faced Princeton in a game that was played with a round ball and, like all early games, used improvised rules.

<p>Modern North American football grew out of a match between <a href="/wiki/McGill_University" title="McGill University">McGill University</a> of Montreal, and Harvard University in 1874. During the game, the two teams alternated between the rugby-based rules used by McGill and the Boston Game rules used by Harvard.

<p>In 1880, Yale coach <a href="/wiki/Walter_Camp" title="Walter Camp">Walter Camp</a>, who had become a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where the rules were debated and changed, devised a number of major innovations. Camp&apos;s two most important rule changes that diverged the American game from rugby was replacing the <a href="/wiki/Scrum_(rugby)" title="Scrum (rugby)">scrummage</a> with the <i><a href="/wiki/Line_of_scrimmage" title="Line of scrimmage">line of scrimmage</a></i> and the establishment of the <i><a href="/wiki/Down_(American_and_Canadian_football)" class="mw-redirect" title="Down (American and Canadian football)">down-and-distance</a></i> rules. American football still however remained a violent sport where collisions often led to serious injuries and sometimes even death. This led <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" title="President of the United States">U.S. President</a> <a href="/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> to hold a meeting with football representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton on October 9, 1905, urging them to make drastic changes. One rule change introduced in 1906, devised to open up the game and reduce injury, was the introduction of the legal <a href="/wiki/Forward_pass" title="Forward pass">forward pass</a>. Though it was underutilized for years, this proved to be one of the most important rule changes in the establishment of the modern game.</p>
<p>Over the years, Canada absorbed some of the developments in American football in an effort to distinguish it from a more rugby-oriented game. In 1903, the <a href="/wiki/Ontario_Rugby_Football_Union" title="Ontario Rugby Football Union">Ontario Rugby Football Union</a> adopted the <a href="/wiki/Burnside_rules" title="Burnside rules">Burnside rules</a>, which implemented the <i>line of scrimmage</i> and <i>down-and-distance</i> system from American football, among others.

<p>In the mid-19th century, various traditional football games, referred to collectively as <i><a href="/wiki/Caid_(sport)" title="Caid (sport)">caid</a></i>, remained popular in Ireland, especially in <a href="/wiki/County_Kerry" title="County Kerry">County Kerry</a>. One observer, Father W. Ferris, described two main forms of <i>caid</i> during this period: the &quot;field game&quot; in which the object was to put the ball through arch-like goals, formed from the boughs of two trees; and the epic &quot;cross-country game&quot; which took up most of the daylight hours of a Sunday on which it was played, and was won by one team taking the ball across a <a href="/wiki/Parish" title="Parish">parish</a> boundary. &quot;Wrestling&quot;, &quot;holding&quot; opposing players, and carrying the ball were all allowed.</p>
<p>By the 1870s, Rugby and Association football had started to become popular in Ireland. <a href="/wiki/Trinity_College,_Dublin" title="Trinity College, Dublin">Trinity College, Dublin</a> was an early stronghold of Rugby (see the <a href="/wiki/Football#Other_developments_in_the_1850s" title="Football">Developments in the 1850s</a> section, above). The rules of the English FA were being distributed widely. Traditional forms of <i>caid</i> had begun to give way to a &quot;rough-and-tumble game&quot; which allowed tripping.</p>
<p>There was no serious attempt to unify and codify Irish varieties of football, until the establishment of the <a href="/wiki/Gaelic_Athletic_Association" title="Gaelic Athletic Association">Gaelic Athletic Association</a> (GAA) in 1884. The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports, such as <a href="/wiki/Hurling" title="Hurling">hurling</a> and to reject imported games like Rugby and Association football. The first Gaelic football rules were drawn up by <a href="/wiki/Maurice_Davin" title="Maurice Davin">Maurice Davin</a> and published in the <i>United Ireland</i> magazine on February 7, 1887. Davin&apos;s rules showed the influence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise a distinctly Irish code of football. The prime example of this differentiation was the lack of an offside rule (an attribute which, for many years, was shared only by other Irish games like hurling, and by Australian rules football).</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/International_Rugby_Board" class="mw-redirect" title="International Rugby Board">International Rugby Football Board</a> (IRFB) was founded in 1886, but rifts were beginning to emerge in the code. <a href="/wiki/Professional_sports" title="Professional sports">Professionalism</a> was beginning to creep into the various codes of football.</p>
<p>In England, by the 1890s, a long-standing <a href="/wiki/Rugby_Football_Union" title="Rugby Football Union">Rugby Football Union</a> ban on <i>professional</i> players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were <a href="/wiki/Working_class" title="Working class">working class</a> and could not afford to take time off to train, travel, play and recover from injuries. This was not very different from what had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England. In 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met in <a href="/wiki/Huddersfield" title="Huddersfield">Huddersfield</a> to form the <a href="/wiki/Rugby_Football_League" title="Rugby Football League">Northern Rugby Football Union</a> (NRFU). The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements. However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required to have a job outside sport.</p>
<p>The demands of a professional league dictated that rugby had to become a better &quot;spectator&quot; sport. Within a few years the NRFU rules had started to diverge from the RFU, most notably with the abolition of the <i><a href="/wiki/Line-out_(rugby_union)" title="Line-out (rugby union)">line-out</a></i>. This was followed by the replacement of the <i><a href="/wiki/Playing_rugby_union#Ruck" class="mw-redirect" title="Playing rugby union">ruck</a></i> with the &quot;play-the-ball ruck&quot;, which allowed a two-player ruck contest between the tackler at marker and the player tackled. <i><a href="/wiki/Rugby_union_gameplay#Maul" title="Rugby union gameplay">Mauls</a></i> were stopped once the ball carrier was held, being replaced by a play-the ball-ruck. The separate Lancashire and Yorkshire competitions of the NRFU merged in 1901, forming the <i>Northern Rugby League</i>, the first time the name <a href="/wiki/Rugby_league" title="Rugby league">rugby league</a> was used officially in England.</p>
<p>Over time, the RFU form of rugby, played by clubs which remained members of national federations affiliated to the IRFB, became known as <a href="/wiki/Rugby_union" title="Rugby union">rugby union</a>.</p>

<p>The need for a single body to oversee association football had become apparent by the beginning of the 20th century, with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The English Football Association had chaired many discussions on setting up an international body, but was perceived as making no progress. It fell to associations from seven other European countries: France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, to form an international association. The <i>F&#xE9;d&#xE9;ration Internationale de Football Association</i> (<a href="/wiki/FIFA" title="FIFA">FIFA</a>) was founded in Paris on May 21, 1904. Its first president was <a href="/wiki/Robert_Gu%C3%A9rin" title="Robert Gu&#xE9;rin">Robert Gu&#xE9;rin</a>. The French name and acronym has remained, even outside French-speaking countries.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Further_divergence_of_the_two_rugby_codes">Further divergence of the two rugby codes</span></h3>
<p>Rugby league rules diverged significantly from rugby union in 1906, with the reduction of the team from 15 to 13 players. In 1907, a New Zealand professional rugby team toured Australia and Britain, receiving an enthusiastic response, and professional <a href="/wiki/Rugby_league_in_Australia" title="Rugby league in Australia">rugby leagues were launched in Australia</a> the following year. However, the rules of professional games varied from one country to another, and negotiations between various national bodies were required to fix the exact rules for each international match. This situation endured until 1948, when at the instigation of the French league, the <a href="/wiki/Rugby_League_International_Federation" title="Rugby League International Federation">Rugby League International Federation</a> (RLIF) was formed at a meeting in <a href="/wiki/Bordeaux" title="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>.</p>
<p>During the second half of 20th century, the rules changed further. In 1966, rugby league officials borrowed the American football concept of <i><a href="/wiki/Down_(football)" class="mw-redirect" title="Down (football)">downs</a></i>: a team was allowed to retain possession of the ball for four tackles (rugby union retains the original rule that a player who is tackled and brought to the ground must release the ball immediately). The maximum number of tackles was later increased to six (in 1971), and in rugby league this became known as the <a href="/wiki/Playing_rugby_league#Six_tackle_rule" class="mw-redirect" title="Playing rugby league"><i>six tackle rule</i></a>.</p>
<p>With the advent of full-time professionals in the early 1990s, and the consequent speeding up of the game, the five metre off-side distance between the two teams became 10&#xA0;metres, and the replacement rule was superseded by various interchange rules, among other changes.</p>
<p>The laws of rugby union also changed during the 20th century, although less significantly than those of rugby league. In particular, goals from <i><a href="/wiki/Mark_(rugby)" title="Mark (rugby)">marks</a></i> were abolished, kicks directly <i><a href="/wiki/Touch_(rugby)" title="Touch (rugby)">into touch</a></i> from outside the <i><a href="/wiki/Rugby_pitch" class="mw-redirect" title="Rugby pitch">22 metre</a></i> line were penalised, new laws were put in place to determine who had possession following an inconclusive <i><a href="/wiki/Ruck_(Rugby_union)" class="mw-redirect" title="Ruck (Rugby union)">ruck</a></i> or <i><a href="/wiki/Rugby_union_gameplay#Maul" title="Rugby union gameplay">maul</a></i>, and the lifting of players in <i><a href="/wiki/Line-out_(rugby_union)" title="Line-out (rugby union)">line-outs</a></i> was legalised.</p>
<p>In 1995, rugby union became an &quot;open&quot; game, that is one which allowed professional players. Although the original dispute between the two codes has now disappeared &#x2013; and despite the fact that officials from both forms of rugby football have sometimes mentioned the possibility of re-unification &#x2013; the rules of both codes and their culture have diverged to such an extent that such an event is unlikely in the foreseeable future.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Use_of_the_word_.22football.22">Use of the word &quot;football&quot;</span></h2>

<p>The word &quot;<i>football</i><span style="padding-left:.2em;">&quot;</span>, when used in reference to a specific game can mean any one of those described above. Because of this, much friendly controversy has occurred over the term <i>football</i>, primarily because it is used in different ways in different parts of the <a href="/wiki/English-speaking_world" title="English-speaking world">English-speaking world</a>. Most often, the word &quot;football&quot; is used to refer to the code of football that is considered dominant within a particular region. So, effectively, what the word &quot;football&quot; means usually depends on where one says it.</p>

<p>In each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football code is known solely as &quot;football&quot;, while the others generally require a qualifier. In New Zealand, &quot;football&quot; historically referred to <a href="/wiki/Rugby_union" title="Rugby union">rugby union</a>, but more recently may be used unqualified to refer to association football. The sport meant by the word &quot;football&quot; in Australia is either <a href="/wiki/Australian_rules_football" title="Australian rules football">Australian rules football</a> or <a href="/wiki/Rugby_league" title="Rugby league">rugby league</a>, depending on popularity (which largely conforms to what has been called the <a href="/wiki/Barassi_Line" title="Barassi Line">Barassi Line</a>).
