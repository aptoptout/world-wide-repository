<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Beginnings.2C_Comedy_Central_era">Beginnings, Comedy Central era</span></h3>
<p><i>BattleBots</i> is an offshoot of the original American version of <i><a href="/wiki/Robot_Wars_(TV_series)" title="Robot Wars (TV series)">Robot Wars</a></i>, the brainchild of Marc Thorpe. Robot Wars had financial backing from Sm:)e communications, a New York record company. The Thorpe/Sm:)e partnership broke up in 1997, starting many years of legal wrangling between Thorpe and <a href="/wiki/Profile_Records" title="Profile Records">Profile Records</a> (the former Sm:)e communications). Profile licensed <i>Robot Wars</i> to a UK production company and <i>Robot Wars</i> ran for seven years as a popular television program in the UK.</p>
<p>The robot builders left behind in San Francisco formed BattleBots, Inc. and began a series of competitions. The first was held in Long Beach, California in August 1999 and <a href="/wiki/Webcast" title="Webcast">streamed online</a>, attracting 40,000 streams. Lenny Stucker, a television producer known for his work on telecasts of <a href="/wiki/Professional_boxing" title="Professional boxing">professional boxing</a>, was in attendance, and showed interest in being involved with <i>BattleBots</i>&#x2014;believing the concept of robot combat was &quot;hip&quot; and having shown an interest in technology. Stucker made changes to the competition&apos;s format and presentation to make it more suitable for television, including elements reminiscent of boxing (such as a red and blue corner) and shifting to a single-elimination format. The creators tried selling the competition as a television series to networks such as <a href="/wiki/CBS" title="CBS">CBS</a>, <a href="/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a>, <a href="/wiki/HBO" title="HBO">HBO</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Showtime_(TV_channel)" class="mw-redirect" title="Showtime (TV channel)">Showtime</a>&#x2014;but they failed to understand the concept of the program or take it seriously. A second event was held as a <a href="/wiki/Pay-per-view" title="Pay-per-view">pay-per-view</a> in <a href="/wiki/Las_Vegas" title="Las Vegas">Las Vegas</a> in 1999; the PPV was in turn, used as a <a href="/wiki/Television_pilot" title="Television pilot">pilot</a> to pitch the show again, with a higher rate of success.</p>
<p>Among the networks interested was <a href="/wiki/Comedy_Central" title="Comedy Central">Comedy Central</a>, who would ultimately pick up the program. <a href="/wiki/Debbie_Liebling" title="Debbie Liebling">Debbie Liebling</a>, the network&apos;s Senior Vice President of original programming and development, felt that the concept would appeal to the network&apos;s young adult demographic, explaining that &quot;it was really funny, and really nerdy. The Internet was not a big thing yet, so the nerd culture wasn&apos;t so celebrated. It was sports for the nerdy person, I guess.&quot; Co-creator Greg Munson viewed the deal as a double-edged sword; it gave <i>BattleBots</i> an outlet and a larger budget, but Comedy Central insisted on the addition of comedic elements to <i>BattleBots</i> as a program, such as <a href="/wiki/Sketch_comedy" title="Sketch comedy">sketches</a> involving contestants. However, the competition itself was not affected by this mandate; Liebling described the final product as being &quot;a parody of a sports show without being a parody&quot;. Munson also noted that Comedy Central &quot;rarely&quot; followed his suggestion of having &quot;attractive geek girls&quot; with sufficient knowledge to speak with builders as co-hosts, electing to keep &quot;throwing bigger and better hot babes at it&quot;, such as <a href="/wiki/Carmen_Electra" title="Carmen Electra">Carmen Electra</a>.</p>
<p>Despite this, viewership and awareness of <i>BattleBots</i> grew progressively over time; contestants Christian Carlberg and Lisa Winter would be invited to appear on <i><a href="/wiki/The_Tonight_Show_with_Jay_Leno" title="The Tonight Show with Jay Leno">The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</a></i>, <i>BattleBots</i> beat <i><a href="/wiki/South_Park" title="South Park">South Park</a></i> as Comedy Central&apos;s highest-rated program for a period during season 3, competitor interest grew, and licensing deals also emerged. The success of <i>BattleBots</i>, however, resulted in competition from other broadcasters; <a href="/wiki/TLC_(TV_network)" title="TLC (TV network)">TLC</a> introduced a competing program, <i><a href="/wiki/Robotica" title="Robotica">Robotica</a></i>, while other channels imported episodes of the British <i>Robot Wars</i> series. By 2002, the program had begun to face further difficulties; Munson felt that the bouts had become &quot;homogenized&quot; because the participants had &quot;perfected&quot; the sport of robot fighting, leading to a lack of innovation in robot designs and strategies. Furthermore, <i>BattleBots</i> had sued <a href="/wiki/Anheuser-Busch" title="Anheuser-Busch">Anheuser-Busch</a> and its advertising agency for producing and airing a <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl_commercial" class="mw-redirect" title="Super Bowl commercial">commercial</a> during <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVII" title="Super Bowl XXXVII">Super Bowl XXXVII</a> that parodied the program and featured a robot greatly resembling one from <i>BattleBots</i> (this lawsuit, however, would be dismissed in 2004, after a judge ruled that the ad was a <a href="/wiki/Parody" title="Parody">parody</a> protected by <a href="/wiki/Fair_use" title="Fair use">fair use</a>). In September 2002, Comedy Central cancelled <i>BattleBots</i> after its fifth season, <i>BattleBots 5.0</i>. <a href="/wiki/Viacom" title="Viacom">Viacom</a> would acquire full control of the network in April 2003; Stucker believed that Comedy Central had become &quot;tired&quot; of the program, and Roski stated that Viacom had wanted to shift Comedy Central back towards traditional comedy programming.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2015-present:_ABC_revival">2015-present: ABC revival</span></h3>
<p>In December 2014, <a href="/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> announced that it had picked up a six-episode revival of <i>BattleBots</i>, produced by <a href="/wiki/Whalerock_Industries" title="Whalerock Industries">Whalerock Industries</a>, to premiere in June 2015. Roski and Munson served as executive producers, joined by <a href="/wiki/Lloyd_Braun" title="Lloyd Braun">Lloyd Braun</a>. The revival drew an average viewership of 5.4 million in its Sunday-night timeslot, with a 1.9 share in the 18-49 demographic. In November 2015, ABC announced that it had renewed the <i>BattleBots</i> revival for a second season, which will see an expansion to a 56-team field.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Weight_classes">Weight classes</span></h3>
<p>Robots at BattleBots tournaments were separated into four weight classes in seasons 1-5. The weight limits increased slightly over time. At the final tournaments the classes were:</p>

<p>&quot;Walking&quot; robots (&quot;StompBots&quot;) propelled by means other than wheels were initially given a 50% weight bonus. The rules changed following the victory of a heavyweight StompBot (Son of Whyachi) at BattleBots 3.0. For BattleBots 4.0 and beyond only a 20% weight bonus was given to walkers and the technical rules specified that walking mechanisms not use <a href="/wiki/Cam" title="Cam">cam</a> operated walking mechanisms as they were functionally too similar to wheel operation. Since the rules change, walking robots have entered the competition, but none has achieved any success beyond preliminary rounds.</p>
<p>Starting in season 6, there are no longer separate weight classes. However, there is a 250-pound weight limit.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Matches">Matches</span></h3>
<p>Matches are three minutes long. During a match, two robots do their best to destroy each other using whatever means available. The match begins by a series of lights that flash from yellow to green. The original Comedy Central version used a standard Christmas tree as seen in the sport of <a href="/wiki/Drag_racing" title="Drag racing">drag racing</a>; the ABC revival uses just one box of lights that flash yellow three times, and then flash green.</p>
<p>There are only two events that cause the match to be paused and people enter the BattleBox. One is the event that the robots are stuck together and cannot separate or that both have simultaneously become immobilized. The other scenario is that one or both &apos;bots have caught on fire. In that case, the people entering the BattleBox are equipped with a fire extinguisher.</p>
<p>If a robot is unable to move for ten seconds, because it is too badly damaged or it is stuck on the arena hazards, it is declared knocked out. In the Comedy Central version, the driver could also call a &quot;tap-out&quot; to forfeit the match if his or her robot is about to be destroyed. This ends the match ten seconds later; the opposing driver is &quot;asked&quot; (but not instructed) not to attack during the ten-second count.</p>
<p>In about half the matches, both robots survive the three minutes; at that point, three judges distribute a total of 45 points (15 points a judge, 5 points per judge per category) over three categories. The robot with the higher score wins. The judging categories are Aggression, Strategy, and Damage. In Season 6 (June/July 2015), the judging categories were Aggression, Damage, Strategy, and Control. A robot who hangs back safely from its opponent will not get many Aggression points; one in there fighting the whole time, however, will. The Strategy category is about how well a robot exploits its opponent&apos;s weaknesses, protects its own, and handles the hazards. A robot driving over the kill saws will lose points here, unless it had good reason to do so, while a robot that is able to attack its opponent&apos;s weak areas will gain points. The Damage category is for how much damage the bot can deal to its opponent while remaining intact itself.</p>
<p>The winner moves on; the loser is eliminated from the tournament.</p>
<p>At the end of the tournament, a series of &apos;rumbles&apos; or &apos;melee rounds&apos; are typically held in each weight class, allowing robots that survived the main tournament to fight in a &apos;free for all&apos; in a 5-minute match. Occasionally there are too many robots for one rumble, and multiple rumbles are held with the top surviving bots competing in a final event. During the Season 5 Heavyweight rumble (the first rumble of that competition), a sheared-off robot part went through the Lexan arena roof and fell (harmlessly) into the audience. Because of this, the rest of the rumbles were canceled due to safety concerns.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Arena">Arena</span></h3>
<p>The BattleBox is a 48&apos; x 48&apos; square arena designed to protect the drivers, officials, and audience from flying shrapnel and charging bots. It was originally designed by Pete Lampertson. For the 2015 season, Pete is still overseeing the box with the help of Matt Neubauer. It has a steel floor and steel-framed walls and roof paneled with thick, bulletproof polycarbonate plastic. The teams bring their robots in through doorways, which are sealed after all humans have exited. The drivers control their machines from outside the sealed arena.</p>
<p>Arena hazards are intended to make fights more interesting and unpredictable, and to reward drivers who can avoid the hazards while pushing or carrying their opponent into them. Hazards from the first five seasons include:</p>
