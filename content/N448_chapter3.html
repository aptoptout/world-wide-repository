When his mother Winifred died shortly after childbirth, Osman was orphaned. His English maternal grandmother took him in and renamed him as Wilfred &quot;Johnny&quot; Johnson, rejecting his Turkish ancestry.</p><p>Stanley&apos;s mother Ir&#xE8;ne Johnson (n&#xE9;e Williams) was English-French and descended from an illegitimate daughter of <a href="/wiki/Prince_Paul_of_W%C3%BCrttemberg" title="Prince Paul of W&#xFC;rttemberg">Prince Paul of W&#xFC;rttemberg</a>. Paul was a great-great-grandfather of Irene and through him, she was a descendant of King <a href="/wiki/George_II_of_Great_Britain" title="George II of Great Britain">George II of Great Britain</a>. Via this connection, Johnson may be related to most of the royal families of Europe, and he is an eighth cousin of British Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/David_Cameron" title="David Cameron">David Cameron</a>.</p><p>Johnson&apos;s mother, Charlotte, was the daughter of barrister <a href="/wiki/James_Fawcett_(barrister)" title="James Fawcett (barrister)">James Fawcett</a>.

In reference to his varied ancestry, Johnson has described himself as a &quot;one-man melting pot&quot;&#x2014;with a combination of Muslims, Jews, and Christians as great-grandparents. The journalist <a href="/wiki/Toby_Young" title="Toby Young">Toby Young</a> has described Johnson&apos;s background as being &quot;lower-upper-middle class&quot;.</p><p>When Boris was born, his parents were living in an apartment opposite the <a href="/wiki/Hotel_Chelsea" title="Hotel Chelsea">Chelsea Hotel</a> in New York City.  They soon embarked on a tour of Canada, <a href="/wiki/New_Hampshire" title="New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Vermont" title="Vermont">Vermont</a> with their newborn. In September 1964 they returned to Britain, enabling Charlotte to undertake an English degree at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oxford" title="University of Oxford">University of Oxford</a>. There, she and her son lived in a flat in <a href="/wiki/Summertown,_Oxford" title="Summertown, Oxford">Summertown</a>, Oxford. She gave birth there to a daughter, <a href="/wiki/Rachel_Johnson" title="Rachel Johnson">Rachel</a>, in 1965. In July 1965 the family moved to <a href="/wiki/Crouch_End" title="Crouch End">Crouch End</a> in <a href="/wiki/North_London" title="North London">North London</a>; in February 1966 they relocated to Washington D.C., where Stanley had gained a job with the <a href="/wiki/World_Bank" title="World Bank">World Bank</a>. A third child, Leo, was born in the US capital in September 1967. Charlotte took up the painting for which she would become publicly known. After Stanley was fired, he obtained a new job as project director of a policy panel on <a href="/wiki/Population_control" title="Population control">population control</a>, in June moving the family to <a href="/w/index.php?title=Harbor_Island_(Connecticut)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Harbor Island (Connecticut) (page does not exist)">Harbor Island</a> in <a href="/wiki/Norwalk,_Connecticut" title="Norwalk, Connecticut">Norwalk</a>, Connecticut. As a child, Johnson was quiet and studious. He suffered from severe deafness and aged eight underwent several operations to have <a href="/wiki/Tympanostomy_tube" title="Tympanostomy tube">grommets</a> inserted in his ears.</p><p>In summer 1969, the family returned to the United Kingdom, settling into a cottage on Stanley&apos;s family farm at Nethercote, near to <a href="/wiki/Winsford" title="Winsford">Winsford</a> in <a href="/wiki/Exmoor" title="Exmoor">Exmoor</a>; the cottage was adjacent to a house inhabited by Stanley&apos;s parents, Johnny and Ir&#xE8;ne Johnson. Stanley was regularly absent from Nethercote, leaving Boris to be raised largely by his mother and <i><a href="/wiki/Au_pair" title="Au pair">au pairs</a></i>. He and his siblings were encouraged to engage in high-brow activities from a young age, with high achievement also being greatly valued; Johnson&apos;s earliest recorded ambition was to be &quot;world king&quot;. Having few or no friends other than their siblings, the children became very close, although Boris became highly competitive toward Rachel. At Nethercote, Johnson gained his first experiences with <a href="/wiki/Fox_hunting" title="Fox hunting">fox hunting</a>. In autumn 1969 the family relocated to <a href="/wiki/Maida_Vale" title="Maida Vale">Maida Vale</a> in North London to enable Stanley to undertake <a href="/wiki/Post-doctoral" class="mw-redirect" title="Post-doctoral">post-doctoral</a> work at the <a href="/wiki/London_School_of_Economics" title="London School of Economics">London School of Economics</a>. In 1970, Charlotte and the children briefly returned to Nethercote, where Boris was schooled at the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Winsford_Village_School&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Winsford Village School (page does not exist)">Winsford Village School</a>, before returning to London to settle in <a href="/wiki/Primrose_Hill" title="Primrose Hill">Primrose Hill</a>, there being educated at <a href="/w/index.php?title=Primrose_Hill_Primary_School&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Primrose Hill Primary School (page does not exist)">Primrose Hill Primary School</a>. In late 1971 another child, <a href="/wiki/Jo_Johnson" title="Jo Johnson">Jo Johnson</a>, was born to the family. In November 1972 they relocated to a larger house nearby.</p><p>After Stanley secured a job as head of the new Prevention of Pollution sub-directorate of the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a>, he moved his family to <a href="/wiki/Brussels" title="Brussels">Brussels</a>, Belgium, in April 1973, where they settled in <a href="/wiki/Uccle" title="Uccle">Uccle</a> and where Boris became fluent in French. Charlotte had a <a href="/wiki/Nervous_breakdown" class="mw-redirect" title="Nervous breakdown">nervous breakdown</a> due to suffering over Stanley&apos;s repeated infidelities; she was hospitalised with clinical <a href="/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder" title="Major depressive disorder">depression</a>. While she was being treated, in September 1975 Boris and his siblings were sent to a preparatory boarding school, <a href="/wiki/Ashdown_House,_East_Sussex" title="Ashdown House, East Sussex">Ashdown House</a> in East Sussex. There he developed a love of <a href="/wiki/Rugby_football" title="Rugby football">rugby</a>, and excelled at <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greek" title="Ancient Greek">Ancient Greek</a> and <a href="/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a>. But, he was appalled at the physical abuse that teachers gave the students, and became a strong critic of <a href="/wiki/Corporal_punishment" title="Corporal punishment">corporal punishment</a>. Meanwhile, Stanley and Charlotte&apos;s relationship broke down in December 1978 and they divorced in 1980. Charlotte moved into a flat in <a href="/wiki/Notting_Hill" title="Notting Hill">Notting Hill</a>, where her children spent much of their time with her.</p><p>&quot;As a kid I was extremely spotty, extremely nerdy and horribly swotty. My idea of a really good time was to travel across London on the tube to visit the <a href="/wiki/British_Museum" title="British Museum">British Museum</a>.&quot;</p><p>While at Ashdown, Johnson was awarded a <a href="/wiki/King%27s_Scholar" title="King&apos;s Scholar">King&apos;s Scholarship</a> to study at <a href="/wiki/Eton_College" title="Eton College">Eton College</a>, the elite independent boarding school in <a href="/wiki/Eton,_Berkshire" title="Eton, Berkshire">Eton, Berkshire</a>. Beginning his education there in the autumn term of 1977, as a King&apos;s Scholar Johnson boarded in College, a house with perhaps a more liberal bent than the conservative and right-wing dominated milieu of the wider school. At Eton Johnson began using the given name &quot;Boris&quot; rather than &quot;Alex&quot;, and developed &quot;the eccentric English persona&quot; for which he later became known. He also abandoned his mother&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Catholicism" title="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> and became an <a href="/wiki/Anglicanism" title="Anglicanism">Anglican</a>, joining the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>.</p><p>Although school reports contain complaints regarding Johnson&apos;s idleness, complacency, and lateness, he proved popular and established himself as a well-known figure within the school. His friends were largely from the wealthy upper middle-classes, with his best friends being <a href="/wiki/Darius_Guppy" title="Darius Guppy">Darius Guppy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Charles_Spencer,_9th_Earl_Spencer" title="Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer">Charles Spencer</a>, both of whom would accompany him to Oxford University and remain friends into adulthood. While he did poorly at science and maths, Johnson excelled in English and Classics, winning prizes in both, including the prestigious Newcastle Prize. He began writing for Eton College&apos;s newspaper, <i>The Chronicle</i>, and in 1981 was appointed its editor, beginning his journalistic career. He also took part in the college&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Debating_society" class="mw-redirect" title="Debating society">debating society</a>, eventually becoming its secretary. In autumn 1981 he was admitted to the Eton Society, better known as &quot;Pop&quot;. Upon finishing his time at Eton, Johnson went on a <a href="/wiki/Gap_year" title="Gap year">gap year</a> to Australia, where he taught English and Latin at <a href="/wiki/Geelong_Grammar_School" title="Geelong Grammar School">Geelong Grammar</a>, an elite independent boarding school.</p><p>Johnson won a scholarship to read <a href="/wiki/Literae_Humaniores" title="Literae Humaniores">Literae Humaniores</a>, a four-year course based in the study of Classics, at <a href="/wiki/Balliol_College,_Oxford" title="Balliol College, Oxford">Balliol College, Oxford</a>, arriving there in the autumn of 1983. He was part of a generation of Oxford undergraduates who came to dominate British politics and media in the early 21st century, among them senior Conservative Party members David Cameron, <a href="/wiki/William_Hague" title="William Hague">William Hague</a>, <a href="/wiki/Michael_Gove" title="Michael Gove">Michael Gove</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jeremy_Hunt" title="Jeremy Hunt">Jeremy Hunt</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Nick_Boles" title="Nick Boles">Nick Boles</a>. At the university he associated primarily with <a href="/wiki/Old_Etonians" class="mw-redirect" title="Old Etonians">Old Etonians</a> and joined the Old Etonian-dominated <a href="/wiki/Bullingdon_Club" title="Bullingdon Club">Bullingdon Club</a>, an upper-class drinking society known for its acts of local vandalism and for wrecking restaurants before paying for the damage. According to Johnson biographer <a href="/w/index.php?title=Sonia_Purnell&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Sonia Purnell (page does not exist)">Sonia Purnell</a>, he was &quot;now ensconced in a closeted upper-class world of entitlement and wealth&quot; quite dissimilar from his upper middle-class upbringing. He began playing rugby for Balliol, continuing to do so for the four years of his degree. Intent on finding a wife, Johnson entered into a relationship with the aristocrat Allegra Mostyn-Owen, and they became engaged while at university.</p><p>Johnson became a popular and well-known public figure at Oxford,  and with Guppy co-edited its satirical magazine <i>Tributary</i>. In 1984 he was elected secretary of the <a href="/wiki/Oxford_Union" title="Oxford Union">Oxford Union</a>, and subsequently campaigned for the position of <a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_presidents_of_the_Oxford_Union&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="List of presidents of the Oxford Union (page does not exist)">Union president</a>; his campaign focused largely on obtaining the support of those from independent schools. With 43% of the vote, he lost the election to <a href="/w/index.php?title=Neil_Sherlock&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Neil Sherlock (page does not exist)">Neil Sherlock</a>. In 1986 Johnson ran for president again, aided by fellow undergraduate <a href="/wiki/Frank_Luntz" title="Frank Luntz">Frank Luntz</a>; his campaign focused on reaching out from his established upper-class support base by emphasising his popular persona and downplaying his connections to the Conservatives. Hoping to court their vote, Johnson associated with university groups affiliated with the centrist <a href="/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_(UK)" title="Social Democratic Party (UK)">Social Democratic Party</a> (SDP) and <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)" title="Liberal Party (UK)">Liberal Party</a>, as part of which he called for electoral reform via the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Proportional_representation" title="Proportional representation">proportional representation</a>. Luntz later alleged that Johnson actively portrayed himself as an SDP supporter during the campaign, although Johnson claims no recollection of having done so.</p><p>Johnson won the election and was appointed president. His presidency was not seen as particularly distinguished or memorable, and questions were raised regarding his competency and seriousness. Having specialised in the study of ancient literature and classical philosophy, Johnson graduated from Balliol College with an <a href="/wiki/British_undergraduate_degree_classification#Upper_second-class_honours" title="British undergraduate degree classification">upper second-class</a> degree. He was deeply unhappy that he did not receive a <a href="/wiki/British_undergraduate_degree_classification#First-class_honours" title="British undergraduate degree classification">first</a>, losing sleep over the issue.</p><p>Johnson and Mostyn-Owen married at St. Michael and All Angels Church in <a href="/wiki/West_Felton" title="West Felton">West Felton</a>, Shropshire, on 5 September 1987, with their wedding reception held at her nearby country seat of Woodhouse. A violin piece was specially commissioned from <a href="/wiki/Hans_Werner_Henze" title="Hans Werner Henze">Hans Werner Henze</a>. Johnson lost his wedding ring an hour after the service. The couple honeymooned in Egypt before settling into a flat in <a href="/wiki/West_Kensington" title="West Kensington">West Kensington</a>, West London. From there, Johnson secured work for a <a href="/wiki/Management_consultancy" class="mw-redirect" title="Management consultancy">management consultancy</a> company, <a href="/wiki/L.E.K._Consulting" title="L.E.K. Consulting">L.E.K. Consulting</a>; finding it incredibly boring, he resigned after a week. Through family connections, in late 1987 he began work as a graduate trainee at <i><a href="/wiki/The_Times" title="The Times">The Times</a></i>; initially stationed for a three-month posting at the <a href="/wiki/Wolverhampton" title="Wolverhampton">Wolverhampton</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Express_%26_Star" title="Express &amp; Star">Express &amp; Star</a></i>, he was given a series of low-grade jobs in <i>The Times</i> office and assigned to shadow established journalist <a href="/w/index.php?title=David_Sapsted&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="David Sapsted (page does not exist)">David Sapsted</a>. Scandal erupted when Johnson wrote an article for the newspaper on the <a href="/wiki/Archaeology" title="Archaeology">archaeological</a> discovery of the palace of <a href="/wiki/Edward_II_of_England" title="Edward II of England">Edward II</a>. Johnson had consulted his own <a href="/wiki/Godparent" title="Godparent">godfather</a>, the historian <a href="/wiki/Colin_Lucas" title="Colin Lucas">Colin Lucas</a>, for information about the site, and added a fictionalised quote which he attributed to Lucas. The quotation contained historically incorrect information, embarrassing Lucas, who complained to <i>The Times&apos;</i> manager <a href="/wiki/Charles_Wilson_(journalist)" title="Charles Wilson (journalist)">Charles Wilson</a>; Wilson sacked Johnson for falsifying the quote.</p><p>Johnson immediately gained a job on the leader writing desk of <i>The Times&apos;</i> main rival, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph" title="The Daily Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a></i>, having known its editor, <a href="/wiki/Max_Hastings" title="Max Hastings">Max Hastings</a>, through his presidency of the Oxford Union. His articles were known for their unique literary style, replete with old-fashioned words, phrases, and humour, and for regularly referring to the readership as &quot;my friends&quot;. They were constructed to appeal strongly to the traditionalist and conservative attitudes of the newspaper&apos;s largely middle-class and middle-aged &apos;<a href="/wiki/Middle_England" title="Middle England">Middle England</a>&apos; readership. Colleagues at the newspaper noted that Johnson did not socialise much with them, preferring the company of bankers and members of the wealthy elite, and that he carefully avoided offending establishment figures with his articles.</p><p>In spring 1989, Johnson was appointed to the newspaper&apos;s Brussels bureau, where he was assigned to report on the events surrounding the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a>. He established himself as one of the few <a href="/wiki/Euroscepticism" title="Euroscepticism">Eurosceptic</a> journalists based in the city, becoming a particularly vehement critic of the Commission president <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Delors" title="Jacques Delors">Jacques Delors</a>. Many of his fellow journalists based in the city were critical of his reports, feeling that they were often dishonest and contained untruths designed to discredit the Commission, with <a href="/w/index.php?title=John_Palmer_(journalist)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="John Palmer (journalist) (page does not exist)">John Palmer</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> stating that &quot;as a journalist he is thoroughly irresponsible, making up stories.&quot; Johnson biographer <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Gimson" title="Andrew Gimson">Andrew Gimson</a> believed that these articles led to him becoming &quot;one of [Euroscepticism&apos;s] most famous exponents&quot;, while according to Purnell, &quot;he helped to take [Euroscepticism] out of the hands of its traditional proponents from the Left, such as veteran Labour MPs <a href="/wiki/Tony_Benn" title="Tony Benn">Tony Benn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Peter_Shore" title="Peter Shore">Peter Shore</a>, and make it an attractive and emotionally resonant cause for the Right.&quot; Conservative Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> described Johnson as her favourite journalist on the basis of these articles. However, Thatcher&apos;s successor <a href="/wiki/John_Major" title="John Major">John Major</a> was annoyed by Johnson and spent much time attempting to refute his claims, unsuccessfully appealing to Hastings to control him.</p><p>&quot;I saw the whole [European Union] change. It was a wonderful time to be there. The <a href="/wiki/Berlin_Wall" title="Berlin Wall">Berlin Wall</a> fell and the French and Germans had to decide how they were going to respond to this event, and what was Europe going to become, and there was this fantastic pressure to create a single polity, to create an answer to the historic German problem, and this produced the most fantastic strains in the Conservative Party, so everything I wrote from Brussels, I found was sort of chucking these rocks over the garden wall and I listened to this amazing crash from the greenhouse next door over in England as everything I wrote from Brussels was having this amazing, explosive effect on the Tory party, and it really gave me this I suppose rather weird sense of power.&quot;</p><p>Johnson&apos;s articles exacerbated tensions between the Eurosceptic and Europhile factions of the Conservative Party, and it was these tensions which were widely viewed as a contributing factor to the party&apos;s failure in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1997" title="United Kingdom general election, 1997">1997 general election</a>; as a result Johnson earned the mistrust of many party members. His writings have also been cited as a key influence on the emergence of the right-wing Eurosceptic <a href="/wiki/UK_Independence_Party" title="UK Independence Party">UK Independence Party</a> (UKIP) in the early 1990s.</p><p>Johnson&apos;s devotion to his journalism exacerbated problems in his marriage, and in February 1990 Allegra left him and returned to London. Although they made various attempts to reconcile, they divorced in April 1993. He had entered into a romantic relationship with a childhood friend, the lawyer <a href="/wiki/Marina_Wheeler" title="Marina Wheeler">Marina Wheeler</a>, who had moved to Brussels for work purposes in 1990. In May 1993, they married at <a href="/wiki/Horsham" title="Horsham">Horsham</a> town hall in <a href="/wiki/Sussex" title="Sussex">Sussex</a> before embarking on a one-night honeymoon in <a href="/wiki/East_Grinstead" title="East Grinstead">East Grinstead</a>. Soon after, a daughter was born to the couple. In 1994, Johnson returned to London, where Hastings turned down his request to become a <a href="/wiki/War_reporter" class="mw-redirect" title="War reporter">war reporter</a>. Instead, he was promoted to the position of assistant editor and chief political columnist. His column was recognised as ideologically eclectic and uniquely written, and earned him a Commentator of the Year Award at the <i><a href="/wiki/What_the_Papers_Say" title="What the Papers Say">What the Papers Say</a></i> awards.</p><p>Johnson&apos;s column would also be criticised in some quarters for exhibiting bigotry and prejudice. In one 2002 column he used the words &quot;<a href="/wiki/Pickaninny" title="Pickaninny">piccannies</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a href="/wiki/Watermelon_stereotype" title="Watermelon stereotype">watermelon smiles</a>&quot; when referring to Africans, also championing European colonialism in Uganda; he allegedly also used the term while visiting Uganda to Swedish <a href="/wiki/UNICEF" title="UNICEF">UNICEF</a> workers and their black driver in 2003. Elsewhere, he used homophobic terminology when referring to gay men as &quot;tank-topped bumboys&quot; further stating that it was &quot;appalling&quot; that the Labour government of Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Tony_Blair" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> were repealing <a href="/wiki/Section_28" title="Section 28">Section 28</a>, a piece of Conservative legislation that was intended to prevent the &quot;promotion&quot; of homosexuality, particularly with regard to children, saying &quot;We don&apos;t want our children being taught some rubbish about homosexual marriage being the same as normal marriage&quot;, describing <a href="/wiki/Same-sex_marriage" title="Same-sex marriage">same-sex marriage</a> as &quot;a ludicrous parody of the real thing&quot;. In his book <i>Friends, Voters, Countrymen</i>, Johnson also said &quot;If gay marriage was OK ... then I saw no reason in principle why a union should not be consecrated between three men, as well as two men; or indeed three men and a dog&quot;.</p><p>Johnson was given a regular column in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Spectator" title="The Spectator">The Spectator</a></i>, <i>The Daily Telegraph</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">&apos;s</span> sister publication; it attracted mixed reviews, and was often thought rushed. In 1999, he was also given a column on new cars in the magazine <i><a href="/wiki/GQ" title="GQ">GQ</a></i>. His behaviour regularly annoyed his editors; those at <i>GQ</i> were frustrated by the large number of parking fines that Johnson acquired while testing cars for them, while he was consistently late in providing his columns for <i>The Telegraph</i> and <i>The Spectator</i>, forcing many staff to stay late to accommodate him; if they went ahead and published without his work included, he would get very angry, and shout at them with expletives.</p><p>Upon returning to Britain, Johnson and his wife settled in Calabria Road in <a href="/wiki/Islington" title="Islington">Islington</a>, North London, before moving to the nearby Furlong Road in March 1999. The Islington area was known for its left-liberal intelligentsia; under the influence of this milieu and the ideas of his new wife, Johnson came to better appreciate alternate points of view. His rightist, traditionalist Conservative attitudes toward issues such as <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a>, <a href="/wiki/LGBT_rights" class="mw-redirect" title="LGBT rights">LGBT rights</a>, and race relations changed, reflecting this liberal influence. It was here that the couple had three further children, all of whom were given the joint surname of Johnson-Wheeler. The children were sent to local Canonbury Primary School, before being sent to independent secondary schools. Devoting much time to his children, he authored a book of verse, <i>Perils of the Pushy Parents&#xA0;&#x2013; A Cautionary Tale</i>, which was published to largely poor reviews.</p><p>Scandal erupted in June 1995 when a recording of a 1990 telephone conversation between Johnson and his friend, businessman <a href="/wiki/Darius_Guppy" title="Darius Guppy">Darius Guppy</a>, was made public. Guppy had requested the private address and telephone number of <i><a href="/wiki/News_of_the_World" title="News of the World">News of the World</a></i> journalist <a href="/w/index.php?title=Stuart_Collier&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Stuart Collier (page does not exist)">Stuart Collier</a>, wishing to have Collier beaten up to prevent him investigating Guppy&apos;s criminal activities. In the conversation, Johnson agreed to provide the information, and expressed concern that he would be associated with the attack. Johnson insisted that he had never actually given Guppy the information, and Collier was not attacked; although Hastings reprimanded Johnson&apos;s behaviour, he was not sacked.</p><p>Johnson had begun to actively contemplate a political career, and in 1993 outlined his desire to stand as a Conservative candidate to be a <a href="/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament" title="Member of the European Parliament">Member of the European Parliament</a> (MEP) in the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_1994" title="European Parliament election, 1994">1994 European Parliament elections</a>. Although Major considered vetoing Johnson&apos;s candidacy, <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Mitchell" title="Andrew Mitchell">Andrew Mitchell</a> convinced him not to; nevertheless Johnson found it impossible to find a constituency and he did not stand in that election. He subsequently turned his attention to obtaining a seat in the UK House of Commons, and after being rejected as Conservative candidate for <a href="/wiki/Holborn_and_St_Pancras_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="Holborn and St Pancras (UK Parliament constituency)">Holborn and St. Pancras</a> he was selected as the Conservative candidate for the Labour <a href="/wiki/Safe_seat" title="Safe seat">safe seat</a> of <a href="/wiki/Clwyd_South_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="Clwyd South (UK Parliament constituency)">Clwyd South</a> in North Wales. Spending six weeks campaigning, he read up on farming and learned some Welsh, although attained only 9,091 votes (23%) in the 1997 general election, losing to the Labour candidate. Moving to become a media personality, in April 1998 he appeared on an episode of <i><a href="/wiki/Have_I_Got_News_for_You" title="Have I Got News for You">Have I Got News for You</a></i>, which brought him to a far wider audience; emphasising a bumbling upper-class persona, he was viewed as entertaining and invited back on to later episodes, including as a guest presenter. After these appearances, he came to be recognised on the street by the public, and was invited to appear on other television shows, such as <i><a href="/wiki/Top_Gear_(2002_TV_series)" title="Top Gear (2002 TV series)">Top Gear</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Parkinson_(TV_series)" title="Parkinson (TV series)">Parkinson</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Breakfast_with_Frost" title="Breakfast with Frost">Breakfast with Frost</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Question_Time_(TV_series)" title="Question Time (TV series)">Question Time</a></i>.</p><p>In July 1999, <a href="/wiki/Conrad_Black" title="Conrad Black">Conrad Black</a>, proprietor of both <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> and <i>The Spectator</i>, offered Johnson the editorship of the latter on the condition that he abandoned his parliamentary aspirations; Johnson agreed. Under Johnson&apos;s editorship, the circulation of <i>The Spectator</i> grew by 10% to 62,000 and it began to turn a profit. He brought in contributions from many figures whom he had known through life, including from his extended family, Eton, Oxford, and his time at <i>The Telegraph</i>. Although retaining <i>The Spectator&apos;</i>s traditional right-wing bent, he also welcomed contributions from leftist writers and cartoonists like <a href="/wiki/Andy_McSmith" title="Andy McSmith">Andy McSmith</a> and <a href="/wiki/Steve_Bell_(cartoonist)" title="Steve Bell (cartoonist)">Steve Bell</a>. Critics, including many involved in <i>The Telegraph</i>, thought that under Johnson&apos;s leadership <i>The Spectator</i> had avoided covering serious issues and focused on insubstantial and trivial topics. Johnson also allowed editors from the adult comic magazine <a href="/wiki/Viz_(comics)" title="Viz (comics)"><i>Viz</i></a> to the <i>Spectator</i>; Simon Thorp (writer for <i>Viz</i>) said that &quot;[Boris Johnson] got us to draw stuff for The Spectator, and I think we managed to successfully lower their tone.&quot; Johnson was also strongly criticised &#x2013; including by his father-in-law <a href="/wiki/Charles_Wheeler_(journalist)" title="Charles Wheeler (journalist)">Charles Wheeler</a> &#x2013; for permitting <a href="/wiki/Taki_Theodoracopulos" title="Taki Theodoracopulos">Taki Theodoracopulos</a>&apos;s use of racist and anti-semitic language in his <i>Spectator</i> column, while Johnson also earned a reputation as a poor political pundit for the incorrect political predictions that he made in the magazine. Within the magazine itself, many were annoyed that Johnson was regularly absent from the office, often missing meetings and events, and that he left much of his work to the last moment.</p><p>&quot;The selection of Boris Johnson... confirms the Tory Party&apos;s increasing weakness for celebrity personalities over the dreary exigencies of politics. Johnson, for all his gifts, is unlikely to grace any future Tory cabinet. Indeed, he is not known for his excessive interest in serious policy matters, and it is hard to see him grubbing away at administrative detail as an obscure, hardworking junior minister for social security. To maintain his funny man reputation he will no doubt find himself refining his <a href="/wiki/Bertie_Wooster" title="Bertie Wooster">Bertie Wooster</a> interpretation to the point where the impersonation becomes the man.&quot;</p><p>Johnson continued to seek a parliamentary seat, and following the retirement of <a href="/wiki/Michael_Heseltine" title="Michael Heseltine">Michael Heseltine</a> was invited to stand as a potential Conservative candidate for <a href="/wiki/Henley_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="Henley (UK Parliament constituency)">Henley</a>, a Conservative safe seat in <a href="/wiki/Oxfordshire" title="Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</a>. The local Conservative branch were split over Johnson&apos;s candidacy; some found him amusing and charming, while others were critical of his flippant attitude to serious matters and his lack of knowledge about the local area. Boosted by his television fame, Johnson stood as the Conservative candidate for <a href="/wiki/Henley_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="Henley (UK Parliament constituency)">Henley</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2001" title="United Kingdom general election, 2001">2001 general election</a>, winning with a majority of 8,500 votes. In becoming a member of parliament, Johnson had broken his promise to Black that he would not do so while editing <i>The Spectator</i>; although labelling Johnson as &quot;ineffably duplicitous&quot;, Black did not sack him, viewing him as &quot;a capable editor&quot; who &quot;helped promote the magazine and raise its circulation&quot; through his regular radio and television appearances.</p><p>Although retaining his main home in Islington, Johnson purchased a &#xA3;650,000 farmhouse outside <a href="/wiki/Thame" title="Thame">Thame</a> in his new constituency. Johnson regularly attended Henley social events, thus attracting local press coverage, and also wrote an occasional column for the <i><a href="/wiki/Henley_Standard" title="Henley Standard">Henley Standard</a></i>. His constituency surgeries proved popular, and he involved himself in local campaigns to save <a href="/wiki/Royal_Berkshire_NHS_Foundation_Trust" title="Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust">Townlands Hospital</a> and the local <a href="/wiki/Air_ambulance" class="mw-redirect" title="Air ambulance">air ambulance</a> from closure, as well as to keep <a href="/wiki/Brakspear" class="mw-redirect" title="Brakspear">Brakspear</a> as an independent brewer. In Parliament, Johnson was appointed to serve on a <a href="/wiki/Standing_committee" class="mw-redirect" title="Standing committee">standing committee</a> assessing the <a href="/wiki/Proceeds_of_Crime_Act_2002" title="Proceeds of Crime Act 2002">Proceeds of Crime Bill</a>, although missed many of its meetings. Despite his credentials as a public speaker, his speeches in the House of Commons were widely deemed lacklustre and lacking in passion, with Johnson later admitting that they were &quot;crap&quot;. In his first four years as MP for Henley he attended just over half of the votes in the House of Commons, although by his second term this had declined to 45%. In most cases he supported the Conservative <a href="/wiki/Party_line_(politics)" title="Party line (politics)">party line</a>, only rebelling against it five times during this period, when he adopted a more socially liberal attitude than the mainstream party; he for instance voted to <a href="/wiki/Local_Government_Act_2003" title="Local Government Act 2003">repeal Section 28</a> and supported the <a href="/wiki/Gender_Recognition_Act_2004" title="Gender Recognition Act 2004">Gender Recognition Act 2004</a>. Although initially claiming that he would not do so, he voted in support of the government&apos;s plans to join the US in the <a href="/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>, and in April 2003 visited the newly liberated Baghdad. By December 2006 he was publicly regretting his decision, describing the invasion as &quot;a colossal mistake and misadventure&quot;.</p><p>Alongside his full-time job as an MP, he continued as editor of <i>The Spectator</i>, as well as with his columns for <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> and <i>GQ</i>, and making television appearances. He also published a book, <i>Friends, Voters, Countrymen: Jottings on the Stump</i>, which recounted his experiences with the 2001 election campaign. His next publication was 2003&apos;s <i>Lend Me Your Ears</i>, a collection of his previously published columns and articles. In 2004 this was followed by his first novel, <i>Seventy-Two Virgins: A Comedy of Errors</i>, which revolved around the life of a Conservative MP and contained various biographical elements. Responding to his critics who believed that he was juggling too many positions, he cited prominent Conservative politicians <a href="/wiki/Winston_Churchill" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> and <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Disraeli" title="Benjamin Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a> as exemplars who combined their political and writing careers. To manage the stress he took up jogging and cycling, and became so well known for the latter that Andrew Gimson suggested that he was &quot;perhaps the most famous cyclist in Britain&quot;.</p><p>Following <a href="/wiki/William_Hague" title="William Hague">William Hague</a>&apos;s resignation as Conservative leader, Johnson supported the candidacy of the only pro-EU figure, <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Clarke" title="Kenneth Clarke">Kenneth Clarke</a>, arguing that he was the only candidate capable of winning an election. Johnson devoted <i>The Spectator</i> to supporting Clarke, although <a href="/wiki/Iain_Duncan_Smith" title="Iain Duncan Smith">Iain Duncan Smith</a> proved successful. Johnson had a strained relationship with Duncan Smith, with <i>The Spectator</i> becoming very critical of the latter&apos;s party leadership. Duncan Smith was removed from his position in November 2003, being replaced by <a href="/wiki/Michael_Howard" title="Michael Howard">Michael Howard</a>; Howard deemed Johnson to be the most popular Conservative politician with the electorate and appointed him vice-chairman of the party, responsible for overseeing their electoral campaign. In May 2004 Howard organised a shadow cabinet reshuffle in which he appointed Johnson to the position of shadow arts minister. In October 2004 Howard ordered Johnson to go to <a href="/wiki/Liverpool" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> and issue a public apology for an article anonymously authored by <a href="/wiki/Simon_Heffer" title="Simon Heffer">Simon Heffer</a> that Johnson had published in <i>The Spectator</i>; in the article, Heffer had claimed that the crowds at the <a href="/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster" title="Hillsborough disaster">Hillsborough disaster</a> had contributed towards the incident and that Liverpool had an excessive predilection for reliance on the welfare state.</p><p>In November 2004, the British tabloids revealed that since 2000, Johnson had been having an affair with <i>Spectator</i> columnist <a href="/wiki/Petronella_Wyatt" title="Petronella Wyatt">Petronella Wyatt</a>, resulting in two terminated pregnancies. Johnson initially dismissed the claims as &quot;piffle&quot;. After the allegations were proven, Howard asked Johnson to resign from his position as vice-chairman and shadow arts minister, not because of the affair but because he had publicly lied about it. Johnson refused, defending his right to lie, at which Howard sacked him from those positions. The scandal was satirised by <i>The Spectator&apos;</i>s theatre critics Toby Young and Lloyd Evans, who produced a play, <i>Who&apos;s the Daddy?</i> at the <a href="/wiki/King%27s_Head_Theatre" title="King&apos;s Head Theatre">King&apos;s Head Theatre</a> in Islington in July 2005. Although he did not prevent them from doing so, Johnson was upset by the play.</p><p>In the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2005" title="United Kingdom general election, 2005">2005 general election</a>, Johnson was re-elected MP for Henley, increasing his majority to 12,793. Following Labour&apos;s victory in the election, Howard stood down as Conservative leader, with Johnson backing <a href="/wiki/David_Cameron" title="David Cameron">David Cameron</a> as his successor. After being successfully selected, Cameron appointed Johnson as the shadow higher education minister, acknowledging his popularity among students. Johnson&apos;s main interest was in streamlining university funding, as part of which he supported Labour&apos;s proposed top-up fees. In September 2006, his image was used in &apos;Boris needs you&apos; and &apos;I Love Boris&apos; material to promote the Conservative Party&apos;s image during <a href="/wiki/Freshers%27_Week" class="mw-redirect" title="Freshers&apos; Week">Freshers&apos; Week</a> in universities. In 2006 Johnson campaigned to become <a href="/wiki/Rector_of_the_University_of_Edinburgh" title="Rector of the University of Edinburgh">Rector</a> of <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh_University" class="mw-redirect" title="Edinburgh University">Edinburgh University</a>, but opponents criticised him with such taglines as &quot;Anyone but Boris&quot; and &quot;Bog off Boris, you Top-up Tory&quot;, and he ultimately came third, with <a href="/wiki/Mark_Ballard" title="Mark Ballard">Mark Ballard</a> winning.</p><p><i>The Spectator&apos;</i>s new chief executive, <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Neil" title="Andrew Neil">Andrew Neil</a>, removed Johnson from his position as editor of the magazine. With his reduction of earnings, Johnson convinced John Bryant, acting editor of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>, to raise his annual fee from &#xA3;200,000 to &#xA3;250,000, averaging at &#xA3;5,000 per column, each of which took up around an hour and a half of his time. He presented a <a href="/wiki/Popular_history" title="Popular history">popular history</a> television show, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Dream_of_Rome" title="The Dream of Rome">The Dream of Rome</a></i>, for <a href="/wiki/Tiger_Aspect_Productions" title="Tiger Aspect Productions">Tiger Aspect</a>; the show was broadcast in January 2006 and a book followed in February. He then produced a sequel, <i>After Rome: Holy Wars and Conquest</i>, in which he focused on early Islamic history, created by his own production studio, Finland Station. As a result of his various activities in 2007 he earned &#xA3;540,000, making him the third highest earning MP in the country that year. In April 2006, the <i><a href="/wiki/News_of_the_World" title="News of the World">News of the World</a></i> stated that Johnson was having an affair with the <i><a href="/wiki/Times_Higher_Education_Supplement" class="mw-redirect" title="Times Higher Education Supplement">Times Higher Education Supplement</a></i> journalist Anna Fazackerley, although both Fackerley and Johnson refused to comment. Fazackerley subsequently stepped down from her job, and was appointed to a new job working for Johnson. He attracted further public attention in April 2006 when he took part in a charity football match between former professional footballers and celebrities from England and Germany, in which he stumbled on the field and rugby tackled former German international <a href="/wiki/Maurizio_Gaudino" title="Maurizio Gaudino">Maurizio Gaudino</a>. In September 2006 he drew criticism from the Papua New Guinea high commission when he compared the frequently changing leadership within the Conservative Party to <a href="/wiki/Cannibalism#New_Guinea" title="Cannibalism">cannibalism in Papua New Guinea</a>. After being criticised by the High Commissioner of Papua New Guinea, Johnson stated &quot;I meant no insult to the people of Papua New Guinea who I&apos;m sure lead lives of blameless bourgeois domesticity in common with the rest of us.&quot;</p><p>In March 2007, Johnson began suggesting standing for the position of <a href="/wiki/Mayor_of_London" title="Mayor of London">Mayor of London</a> in the <a href="/wiki/London_mayoral_election,_2008" title="London mayoral election, 2008">2008 mayoral election</a>. His candidacy was not initially taken seriously within the Conservative Party, who instead considered <a href="/wiki/Nick_Boles" title="Nick Boles">Nick Boles</a> the party&apos;s main contender for the job. However, after Boles had to withdraw and no other well-known candidate was forthcoming, Cameron agreed to back Johnson&apos;s candidacy. He was reassured by London&apos;s free newspaper, the <i><a href="/wiki/Evening_Standard" class="mw-redirect" title="Evening Standard">Evening Standard</a></i>, that they would support him throughout the campaign. In July 2007, he officially announced his candidacy, and was selected as Conservative candidate in September after gaining 79% of the vote in a public London-wide <a href="/wiki/Primary_election" title="Primary election">primary</a>. There was some anger in Henley among party members and constituents who felt that Johnson was abandoning them for London. <a href="/wiki/Simon_Heffer" title="Simon Heffer">Simon Heffer</a> in <i>The Telegraph</i> described all candidates as being insufficiently serious to assume the role of <a href="/wiki/Mayor_of_London" title="Mayor of London">Mayor of London</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Peregrine_Worsthorne" title="Peregrine Worsthorne">Peregrine Worsthorne</a> noted that the harder Johnson tried to be serious, &quot;the more insincere, incoherent, evasive and even puerile he looked and sounded&quot;. Labour incumbent <a href="/wiki/Ken_Livingstone" title="Ken Livingstone">Ken Livingstone</a> took Johnson more seriously than many others were doing, referring to him as &quot;the most formidable opponent I will face in my political career.&quot; Livingstone&apos;s campaign focused on portraying Johnson as an upper-class <a href="/wiki/Toff" title="Toff">toff</a> who was out of touch with the lives of most Londoners, also alleging that he was a bigot, as evidenced by racist and homophobic language that he had used in his <i>Telegraph</i> column; Johnson responded that these quotes had been taken out of context and had been meant in a <a href="/wiki/Satire" title="Satire">satirical</a> manner. This situation was exacerbated when the far right <a href="/wiki/British_National_Party" title="British National Party">British National Party</a> (BNP) urged its supporters to give their second preference votes to Johnson; he responded that &quot;I utterly and unreservedly condemn the BNP&quot;. Controversy was also generated when Johnson admitted that while a student he had used <a href="/wiki/Cannabis" title="Cannabis">cannabis</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cocaine" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a>.</p><p>Johnson&apos;s candidacy was primarily funded by sympathetic individuals in London&apos;s financial sector. The Conservative Party hired Australian election strategist <a href="/wiki/Lynton_Crosby" title="Lynton Crosby">Lynton Crosby</a> to run Johnson&apos;s campaign. Aware of Johnson&apos;s propensity for committing gaffes, Crosby prevented him from holding interviews with the print and broadcast media in favour of radio talk shows and daytime television which asked &quot;easier&quot; questions. Crosby also made Johnson tell fewer jokes and have a simpler <a href="/wiki/Haircut" class="mw-redirect" title="Haircut">haircut</a> to help make him appear more serious. Johnson&apos;s campaign focused on reducing youth crime, making public transport safer, and replacing the &apos;<a href="/wiki/Articulated_buses_in_London" title="Articulated buses in London">bendy buses</a>&apos; with a new fleet of <a href="/wiki/Routemaster" title="Routemaster">Routemasters</a>. Johnson&apos;s campaign capitalised on his popularity, even among those who opposed his policies. His political opponents complained that a common attitude among voters was that &quot;I&apos;m voting for Boris because he is a laugh&quot;. The campaign targeted Conservative-leaning suburbs in <a href="/wiki/Outer_London" title="Outer London">outer London</a> to capitalise on a sense of being overlooked by the Livingstone administration which had paid most attention to inner London areas. Johnson also focused on counteracting his image as a bigot; he declared that &quot;I&apos;m absolutely 100% anti-racist; I despise and loath racism&quot;. Publicly emphasising his Turkish ancestry, he went contrary to Conservative policy by declaring his support for an earned amnesty for illegal immigrants.</p><p>The election took place in May 2008, and witnessed a turnout of approximately 45% of eligible voters, with Johnson receiving 43.2% and Livingstone 37% of first-preference votes; when second-preference votes were added, Johnson proved victorious with 53.2% to Livingstone&apos;s 46.8%. Johnson benefited from a large <a href="/wiki/Voter_turnout" title="Voter turnout">voter turnout</a> in Conservative strongholds, in particular <a href="/wiki/Bexley" title="Bexley">Bexley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bromley" title="Bromley">Bromley</a> where he amassed a majority of over 80,000 over Livingstone. Johnson thus won the largest personal electoral mandate in the UK. Following his victory, he praised Livingstone as a &quot;very considerable public servant&quot; and added that he hoped to &quot;discover a way in which the mayoralty can continue to benefit from your transparent love of London&quot;. He also announced that, as a result of his victory, he would <a href="/wiki/Resignation_from_the_British_House_of_Commons" title="Resignation from the British House of Commons">resign as Member of Parliament</a> for Henley.</p><p>Upon his victory, Johnson settled in to the Mayoral offices at <a href="/wiki/City_Hall,_London" title="City Hall, London">City Hall</a>. His first official engagement came several days after the election, when he appeared at the <a href="/wiki/Sikhism" title="Sikhism">Sikh</a> celebrations for <a href="/wiki/Vaisakhi" title="Vaisakhi">Vaisakhi</a> in <a href="/wiki/Trafalgar_Square" title="Trafalgar Square">Trafalgar Square</a>. His first policy initiative, issued that month, came as a ban on drinking alcohol on public transport. He received criticism during the early weeks of his administration, largely because he was late to two official functions in his first week on the job, and because after three weeks he embarked on a holiday to Turkey. In July 2008 Johnson visited Beijing to attend the closing ceremony of the <a href="/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics" title="2008 Summer Olympics">2008 Summer Olympics</a> as London&apos;s representative to receive the Olympic flag from <a href="/wiki/Guo_Jinlong" title="Guo Jinlong">Guo Jinlong</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Mayor_of_Beijing" class="mw-redirect" title="Mayor of Beijing">Mayor of Beijing</a> to announce London as Olympic host city. While taking on the Olympic flag, he offended his Chinese hosts by not having his jacket buttoned-up.</p><p>Johnson had not brought a team of assistants with him to the job as Livingstone had done, instead developing his team over the following six months. Those in City Hall who were deemed too closely allied to the previous Livingstone administration had their employment terminated. Johnson appointed <a href="/wiki/Tim_Parker" title="Tim Parker">Tim Parker</a> to be first deputy mayor, but after Parker began insisting that all staff report directly to him and took increasing control over the running of City Hall, Johnson was convinced to sack him. As a result of these problems, many in the Conservative Party initially distanced themselves from Johnson&apos;s administration, fearing that it would be counter-productive to achieving a Conservative victory in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010" title="United Kingdom general election, 2010">2010 general election</a>.</p><p>During the electoral campaign, Johnson had confided to <a href="/wiki/Brian_Paddick,_Baron_Paddick" title="Brian Paddick, Baron Paddick">Brian Paddick</a> that he was unsure how he would retain his current lifestyle while relying upon the Mayoral salary of &#xA3;140,000 a year. Dealing with this problem, he agreed to continue writing his <i>Telegraph</i> column alongside his Mayoral position, thus earning him a further &#xA3;250,000 a year. His team recognised that this would prove controversial with the electorate, and made him promise to donate a fifth of his <i>Telegraph</i> fee to a charitable cause providing bursaries for students of journalism and Classics. Johnson resented this, and ultimately did not pay a full fifth. The situation generated controversy when he was questioned regarding his <i>Telegraph</i> fee on <a href="/wiki/BBC" title="BBC">BBC</a>&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/HARDtalk" title="HARDtalk">HARDtalk</a></i>; here, he referred to the &#xA3;250,000 as &quot;chicken feed&quot;, something that was widely condemned given that &#xA3;250,000 was roughly ten times the average yearly wage for a British worker.</p><p>Johnson made no major changes to the mayoral system as developed by Livingstone. He did however reverse a number of measures implemented by Livingstone&apos;s administration, by ending the city&apos;s oil deal with Venezuela, abolishing <i><a href="/wiki/The_Londoner" title="The Londoner">The Londoner</a></i> newsletter, and scrapping the half yearly inspections of <a href="/wiki/Hackney_carriage" title="Hackney carriage">black cabs</a> (although the latter were reinstated three years later). Abolishing the western wing of the congestion charging zone, he cancelled plans to increase the congestion charge for <a href="/wiki/Four-wheel_drive" title="Four-wheel drive">four-wheel drives</a>. He also sought to claim credit for projects like <a href="/wiki/Crossrail" title="Crossrail">Crossrail</a> and the <a href="/wiki/2012_Olympic_Games" class="mw-redirect" title="2012 Olympic Games">2012 Olympic Games</a> which had been introduced by the Livingstone administration. He introduced a public bicycle scheme which had been mooted by Livingstone&apos;s administration; colloquially known as &quot;<a href="/wiki/Santander_Cycles" title="Santander Cycles">Boris Bikes</a>&quot;, the partly privately financed system cost &#xA3;140&#xA0;million and was a significant financial loss although it proved popular. Despite Johnson&apos;s support of cycling in London &#x2013; and his much publicised identity as a cyclist himself &#x2013; his administration was criticised by some cycling groups who argued that he had failed to make the city&apos;s roads safer for cyclists. As per his election pledge, he also commissioned the development of the <a href="/wiki/New_Routemaster" title="New Routemaster">New Routemaster</a> buses for central London. He also ordered the construction of a <a href="/wiki/Emirates_Air_Line_(cable_car)" title="Emirates Air Line (cable car)">cable-car system</a> that crossed the <a href="/wiki/River_Thames" title="River Thames">River Thames</a> between <a href="/wiki/Greenwich_Peninsula" title="Greenwich Peninsula">Greenwich Peninsula</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Docks" title="Royal Docks">Royal Docks</a>. In financing these projects, Johnson&apos;s administration had borrowed &#xA3;100&#xA0;million, while public transport fares had increased by 50%.</p><p>During the first term of his mayoralty, Johnson was perceived as having moved leftward on certain issues, for instance by supporting the <a href="/wiki/Living_wage_in_the_United_Kingdom" class="mw-redirect" title="Living wage in the United Kingdom">London Living Wage</a> and the idea of an amnesty for illegal migrants. In August 2008, Johnson broke from the traditional procedure of those in public office not publicly commenting on other nations&apos; elections when he openly endorsed then-Senator <a href="/wiki/Barack_Obama" title="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a> for the <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2008" title="United States presidential election, 2008">presidency of the United States</a>. He similarly placated critics who had deemed him a bigot by appearing at <a href="/wiki/Pride_London" title="Pride London">London&apos;s gay pride parade</a> and praising ethnic minority newspapers.</p><p>Taking a particular interest in policing within Greater London, Johnson appointed himself Chairman of the <a href="/wiki/Metropolitan_Police_Authority" title="Metropolitan Police Authority">Metropolitan Police Authority</a> (MPA), and in October 2008 successfully pushed for the resignation of Metropolitan Police Commissioner <a href="/wiki/Ian_Blair" title="Ian Blair">Ian Blair</a> after the latter was heavily criticised for allegedly handing contracts over to friends and for his handling of the <a href="/wiki/Death_of_Jean_Charles_de_Menezes" title="Death of Jean Charles de Menezes">death of Jean Charles de Menezes</a>. This action earned Johnson great respect within the Conservative Party, whose members widely interpreted it as his first act of strength and assertiveness. Although he resigned as Chairman of the MPA in January 2010, throughout his mayoralty Johnson would be highly supportive of the Metropolitan Police, particularly during the controversy surrounding the <a href="/wiki/Death_of_Ian_Tomlinson" title="Death of Ian Tomlinson">death of Ian Tomlinson</a>. Controversy was generated when Johnson was accused of warning the MP <a href="/wiki/Damian_Green" title="Damian Green">Damian Green</a> that police were planning to arrest him; Johnson denied the claims and did not face criminal charges under the <a href="/wiki/Criminal_Justice_Act" title="Criminal Justice Act">Criminal Justice Act</a>. Overall crime in London fell during his administration, although his claim that serious youth crime had decreased was shown to be false, as it had increased. Similarly, his claim that Metropolitan Police numbers had increased was also shown to be incorrect, as the city&apos;s police force had decreased in size under his administration, in line with the rest of the country. He was also criticised for his response to the <a href="/wiki/2011_England_riots" title="2011 England riots">2011 London riots</a>; holidaying with his family in <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a> when the rioting broke out, he did not immediately return to London, only returning 48 hours after it had begun and addressing Londoners 60 hours after. Upon visiting shopkeepers and residents affected by the riots in <a href="/wiki/Clapham" title="Clapham">Clapham</a>, he was booed and jeered away by some elements within the crowds.</p><p>Johnson championed London&apos;s financial sector and denounced what he saw as &quot;banker bashing&quot; following the <a href="/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308" title="Financial crisis of 2007&#x2013;08">financial crisis of 2007&#x2013;08</a>, condemning the <a href="/wiki/Anti-capitalism" title="Anti-capitalism">anti-capitalist</a> <a href="/wiki/Occupy_London" title="Occupy London">Occupy London</a> movement that appeared in 2011. He spent much of his time with bankers and others involved in the financial services, and criticised the government&apos;s 50p tax rate for higher earners. He collected donations from the city&apos;s wealthy for a charitable enterprise, the Mayor&apos;s Fund, which he had established to aid disadvantaged youths; although initially announcing that it would raise &#xA3;100&#xA0;million, by 2010 it had only spent &#xA3;1.5&#xA0;million. He also retained extensive personal contacts throughout the British media, which resulted in widespread favourable press coverage of his administration. In turn he remained largely supportive of his friends in the media, among them <a href="/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch" title="Rupert Murdoch">Rupert Murdoch</a>, during the <a href="/wiki/News_International_phone_hacking_scandal" title="News International phone hacking scandal">News International phone hacking scandal</a>.</p><p>During his first administration, Johnson was also embroiled in a number of personal scandals; after moving to a &#xA3;2.3&#xA0;million house in Colebrooke Row, Islington, he built a shed on his balcony without obtaining <a href="/wiki/Planning_permission" title="Planning permission">planning permission</a>. Neighbours complained and he dismantled the shed, but critics stated that he was either unaware of the law or intentionally disregarded it. The press also accused him of having an affair with Helen Macintyre and of fathering her child; he did not deny the allegations, with Marina throwing him out of the family home for a time. He was accused of <a href="/wiki/Cronyism" title="Cronyism">cronyism</a>, in particular for appointing <a href="/wiki/Veronica_Wadley" title="Veronica Wadley">Veronica Wadley</a>, a former <i>Evening Standard</i> editor who had supported him, as the chair of London&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Arts_Council" class="mw-redirect" title="Arts Council">Arts Council</a> when she was widely regarded as not being the best candidate for the position. He was caught up in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_parliamentary_expenses_scandal" title="United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal">parliamentary expenses scandal</a> and accused of excessive personal spending on taxi journeys, with his deputy mayor <a href="/wiki/Ian_Clement" title="Ian Clement">Ian Clement</a> having been found to have misused a City Hall credit card, resulting in his resignation. Johnson remained a popular figure in London with a strong celebrity status. In 2009, he rescued a woman, <a href="/wiki/Franny_Armstrong" title="Franny Armstrong">Franny Armstrong</a>, from anti-social teenagers who had threatened her while he was cycling past.</p><p>Up for re-election in 2012, Johnson again hired Crosby to orchestrate his campaign. Before the election, Johnson published <i>Johnson&apos;s Life of London</i>, a work of popular history which the historian <a href="/wiki/A._N._Wilson" title="A. N. Wilson">A. N. Wilson</a> characterised as a &quot;coded plea&quot; for votes. Polls suggested that while Livingstone&apos;s approach to transport was preferred, voters in London placed greater trust in Johnson over issues of crime and the economy.</p><p>Johnson assumed control at <a href="/wiki/City_Hall,_London" title="City Hall, London">City Hall</a> on 4 May 2008.

Johnson himself said that he was &quot;misled&quot; by Lewis. On 22 June 2009, Ian Clement resigned after breaking rules by paying for personal items using a corporate credit card.</p><p>At the beginning of his tenure as Mayor, Johnson announced plans to extend Pay As You Go <a href="/wiki/Oyster_card" title="Oyster card">Oyster card</a> to national rail services in London (PAYG Oyster card had been extended to suburban <a href="/wiki/London_Overground" title="London Overground">London Overground</a> services in 2007).</p><p>One of the pledges in Johnson&apos;s election manifesto was to retain Tube ticket offices, in opposition to Livingstone&apos;s proposal to close up to 40 London Underground ticket offices. On 2 July 2008 the Mayor&apos;s office announced that the closure plan was to be abandoned and that offices would remain open. On 21 November 2013, Transport for London announced that all London Underground ticket offices would close by 2015.</p><p>The formation of the Forensic Audit Panel was announced on 8 May 2008. The Panel is tasked with monitoring and investigating financial management at the <a href="/wiki/London_Development_Agency" title="London Development Agency">London Development Agency</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Greater_London_Authority" title="Greater London Authority">Greater London Authority</a>.

Previously the GLA investigated allegations of financial mismanagement itself.</p><p>Johnson&apos;s announcement was criticised by Labour for the perceived politicisation of this nominally independent panel, who asked if the appointment of these key Johnson allies to the panel &#x2013; &quot;to dig dirt on Ken Livingstone&quot; &#x2013; was &quot;an appropriate use of public funds&quot;. Wheatcroft is married to a Conservative councillor and three of the four remaining panel members also have close links to the Conservatives: <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Greenhalgh" title="Stephen Greenhalgh">Stephen Greenhalgh</a> (Conservative Leader of Hammersmith and Fulham Council), Patrick Frederick (Chairman of Conservative Business Relations for South East England and Southern London) and Edward Lister (Conservative Leader of Wandsworth Council).</p><p>Three weeks before the <a href="/wiki/London_mayoral_election,_2012" title="London mayoral election, 2012">London mayoral election, 2012</a>, he prevented London buses from carrying advertising for a Christian campaign which advocated treatment for homosexuality. The campaign was to advertise the phrase, &quot;Not gay! Ex-gay, post-gay and proud. Get over it!&quot; Johnson told <i>The Guardian</i> that he regarded London as &quot;one of the most tolerant cities in the world and intolerant of intolerance&quot;. He said, &quot;It is clearly offensive to suggest that being gay is an illness that someone recovers from and I am not prepared to have that suggestion driven around London on our buses&quot;.</p><p>During the 2012 Mayoral election, Johnson sought re-election, while Livingstone was again selected as the Labour candidate. Johnson&apos;s campaign emphasised the accusation that Livingstone was guilty of <a href="/wiki/Tax_evasion" title="Tax evasion">tax evasion</a>, for which Livingstone called Johnson a &quot;bare-faced liar&quot;. The political scientist Andrew Crines believed that Livingstone&apos;s campaign had focused on criticising Johnson rather than presenting an alternate and progressive vision of London&apos;s future. In 2012, he was <a href="/wiki/London_mayoral_election,_2012" title="London mayoral election, 2012">re-elected</a> as Mayor, again defeating Livingstone.</p><p>London was successful in its bid to host the <a href="/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics" title="2012 Summer Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a> while Ken Livingstone was still Mayor in 2005. Johnson&apos;s role in the proceedings was to be the co-chair of an Olympic board which oversaw the Games. Two of the actions subsequent to taking on this role were to improve the transport around London by making more tickets available and laying on more buses around the capital during the busy period as thousands of spectators were temporary visitors in London, and also to allow shops and supermarkets to have longer <a href="/wiki/Sunday_shopping#England_and_Wales" title="Sunday shopping">hours on Sundays</a>.</p><p>On 21 November 2013, Johnson announced major changes to the operation of London Underground, including the extension of Tube operating hours to run through the night at weekends. The announcement also revealed that all staffed Underground ticket offices would be closed with the aim of saving over &#xA3;40&#xA0;million a year, with automated ticketing systems provided instead.</p><p>In an interview for the <i>New Statesman</i> in February 2012 he criticised London&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Saint_Patrick%27s_Day" title="Saint Patrick&apos;s Day">Saint Patrick&apos;s Day</a> gala dinner celebrations. Linking them to <a href="/wiki/Sinn_F%C3%A9in" title="Sinn F&#xE9;in">Sinn F&#xE9;in</a>, he branded the event as &quot;Lefty crap&quot;. He subsequently apologised for the remarks.</p><p>In February 2013, during a London Assembly meeting following the publication of the 2014 budget for London, Johnson was ejected from the meeting following a vote and on the grounds that his Deputy <a href="/wiki/Victoria_Borwick" title="Victoria Borwick">Victoria Borwick</a> had left the chamber. Upon realising that the vote meant that he would not be questioned on the budget, Johnson referred to his political opponents as &apos;great supine protoplasmic invertebrate jellies.&apos;</p><p>Boris Johnson was present at the launch of the <a href="/w/index.php?title=World_Islamic_Economic_Forum&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="World Islamic Economic Forum (page does not exist)">World Islamic Economic Forum</a> in London in July 2013, where he answered questions alongside Malaysian Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Najib_Razak" title="Najib Razak">Najib Razak</a> and other public figures. Responding to a question about women in the Islamic world, Razak said, &quot;Before coming here, my officials have told me that the latest university intake in Malaysia, a Muslim country, 68% will be women entering our universities.&quot; Johnson then interrupted and said, &quot;They&apos;ve got to find men to marry.&quot; The remark elicited laughter and groans, and was later criticised by women who attended the event and others who were offended. Pippa Crerar, political correspondent for the <i><a href="/wiki/London_Evening_Standard" title="London Evening Standard">London Evening Standard</a></i>, was at the event and wrote that it was &quot;a stupid comment&quot; but &quot;clearly a joke and was met with the groans it deserved&quot;. After controversy erupted, Johnson issued a statement: &quot;Some people seem to have misconstrued something I said at a press conference 5 days ago, about relative male underachievement in university entrance. It is utterly ludicrous and infuriating to suggest that I think women go to University to find a husband. I was merely pointing out something that I&apos;ve said several times before &#x2014; that with a graduate cohort 68 per cent female you intensify the phenomenon sociologists identify as <a href="/wiki/Assortative_mating" title="Assortative mating">assortative mating</a>.&quot; A source at City Hall described the comment as &quot;off the cuff and completely light-hearted&quot;.</p><p>Johnson had initially denied that he would seek a return to the House of Commons while remaining Mayor.

Johnson purposely cultivates a &quot;semi-shambolic look&quot;, for instance by specifically ruffling his hair in a certain way for when he makes public appearances. Purnell described him as &quot;a manic self-promoter&quot; who filled his life with &quot;fun and jokes&quot;.

Purnell noted that he deflected serious questions using &quot;a little humour and a good deal of bravado&quot;. According to Gimson, Johnson was &quot;a humane man&quot; who &quot;could also be staggeringly inconsiderate of others&quot; when focusing upon his own interests.
