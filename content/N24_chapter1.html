The former diplomat became a London cab driver to support his family and eventually settled down in England.</p>
<p>His son, Helen Mirren&apos;s father, anglicised the family name to Mirren in the 1950s and changed his name to Basil Mirren. He played the <a href="/wiki/Viola" title="Viola">viola</a> with the <a href="/wiki/London_Philharmonic" class="mw-redirect" title="London Philharmonic">London Philharmonic</a> before World War II, and later drove a taxi cab and was a driving-test examiner, before becoming a civil servant with the Ministry of Transport.

<p>A further stage breakthrough came in 1994, in an <a href="/wiki/Yvonne_Arnaud_Theatre" title="Yvonne Arnaud Theatre">Yvonne Arnaud Theatre</a> production bound for the West End, when <a href="/wiki/Bill_Bryden" title="Bill Bryden">Bill Bryden</a> cast her as Natalya Petrovna in <a href="/wiki/Ivan_Turgenev" title="Ivan Turgenev">Ivan Turgenev</a>&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/A_Month_in_the_Country_(play)" title="A Month in the Country (play)">A Month in the Country</a></i>.

The production received poor reviews; <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> called it &quot;plodding spectacle rarely informed by powerful passion&quot;, while <i><a href="/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph" title="The Daily Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a></i> said &quot;the crucial sexual chemistry on which any great production ultimately depends is fatally absent&quot;.
