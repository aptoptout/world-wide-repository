I like his music, you feel me. I&#x2019;m not a hater or a critic on him, you know, I do me. God bless him, God bless me. But don&apos;t get mad because I took a style and made it better than his. Technically, we all out here trying to get money. Do you. Not to sound funny but maybe one day that man could learn something from me-feel me?&quot;</p>
