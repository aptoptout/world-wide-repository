<p><b>Design</b> is the creation of a <a href="/wiki/Plan_(drawing)" title="Plan (drawing)">plan</a> or <a href="/wiki/Convention_(norm)" title="Convention (norm)">convention</a> for the construction of an object, system or measurable human interaction (as in <a href="/wiki/Blueprint" title="Blueprint">architectural blueprints</a>, <a href="/wiki/Engineering_drawing" title="Engineering drawing">engineering drawings</a>, <a href="/wiki/Business_process" title="Business process">business processes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Circuit_diagram" title="Circuit diagram">circuit diagrams</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pattern_(sewing)" title="Pattern (sewing)">sewing patterns</a>). Design has different connotations in different fields (see <a href="#Design_disciplines">design disciplines</a> below). In some cases the direct construction of an object (as in <a href="/wiki/Pottery" title="Pottery">pottery</a>, <a href="/wiki/Engineering" title="Engineering">engineering</a>, <a href="/wiki/Management" title="Management">management</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cowboy_coding" title="Cowboy coding">cowboy coding</a> and <a href="/wiki/Graphic_design" title="Graphic design">graphic design</a>) is also considered to be design.</p>
<p>Designing often necessitates considering the <a href="/wiki/Aesthetic" class="mw-redirect" title="Aesthetic">aesthetic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Functionalism_(architecture)" title="Functionalism (architecture)">functional</a>, economic and sociopolitical dimensions of both the design object and design process. It may involve considerable <a href="/wiki/Research" title="Research">research</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thought" title="Thought">thought</a>, <a href="/wiki/Physical_model" title="Physical model">modeling</a>, interactive <a href="/wiki/Problem_solving" title="Problem solving">adjustment</a>, and re-design. Meanwhile, diverse kinds of objects may be designed, including <a href="/wiki/Clothing" title="Clothing">clothing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Graphical_user_interface" title="Graphical user interface">graphical user interfaces</a>, <a href="/wiki/Skyscraper" title="Skyscraper">skyscrapers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Corporate_identity" title="Corporate identity">corporate identities</a>, <a href="/wiki/Business_process" title="Business process">business processes</a> and even methods of designing.</p>
<p>Thus &quot;design&quot; may be a substantive referring to a categorical abstraction of a created thing or things (the design of something), or a verb for the process of creation, as is made clear by grammatical context.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Definitions">Definitions</span></h2>
<p>More formally design has been defined as follows.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>(noun) a specification of an <a href="/wiki/Object_(philosophy)" title="Object (philosophy)">object</a>, manifested by an <a href="/wiki/Agency_(philosophy)" title="Agency (philosophy)">agent</a>, intended to accomplish <a href="/wiki/Goal" title="Goal">goals</a>, in a particular <a href="/wiki/Environment_(systems)" title="Environment (systems)">environment</a>, using a set of primitive components, satisfying a set of <a href="/wiki/Requirement" title="Requirement">requirements</a>, subject to constraints;</i></dd>
<dd><i>(verb, transitive) to create a design, in an <a href="/wiki/Environment_(systems)" title="Environment (systems)">environment</a> (where the designer operates)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Another definition for design is <i>a roadmap or a strategic approach for someone to achieve a unique expectation. It defines the specifications, plans, parameters, costs, activities, processes and how and what to do within legal, political, social, environmental, safety and economic constraints in achieving that objective.</i></p>
<p>Here, a &quot;specification&quot; can be manifested as either a plan or a finished product, and &quot;primitives&quot; are the elements from which the design object is composed.</p>
<p>With such a broad denotation, there is no <a href="/wiki/Organizational_communication" title="Organizational communication">universal language</a> or <a href="/wiki/Institutional_memory" title="Institutional memory">unifying institution</a> for designers of all disciplines. This allows for many differing philosophies and approaches toward the subject (see <a href="#Philosophies_and_studies_of_design">Philosophies and studies of design</a>, below).</p>
<p>The person designing is called a <i><a href="/wiki/Designer" title="Designer">designer</a></i>, which is also a term used for people who work professionally in one of the various design areas, usually also specifying which area is being dealt with (such as a <i>fashion designer</i>, <i>concept designer</i> or <i>web designer</i>). A designer&apos;s sequence of activities is called a design process. The scientific study of design is called <a href="/wiki/Design_science" title="Design science">design science</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Design_as_a_process">Design as a process</span></h2>
<p>Substantial disagreement exists concerning how designers in many fields, whether amateur or professional, alone or in teams, produce designs. Dorst and Dijkhuis argued that &quot;there are many ways of describing design processes&quot; and discussed &quot;two basic and fundamentally different ways&quot;, both of which have several names. The prevailing view has been called &quot;The Rational Model&quot;, &quot;Technical Problem Solving&quot; and &quot;The Reason-Centric Perspective&quot;. The alternative view has been called &quot;Reflection-in-Action&quot;, &quot;Evolutionary Design&quot;, &quot;co-evolution&quot; and &quot;The Action-Centric Perspective&quot;.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Rational_Model">The Rational Model</span></h3>
<p>The Rational Model was independently developed by <a href="/wiki/Herb_Simon" class="mw-redirect" title="Herb Simon">Simon</a> and Pahl and Beitz. It posits that:</p>
<ol>
<li>designers attempt to <a href="/wiki/Optimization_(mathematics)" class="mw-redirect" title="Optimization (mathematics)">optimize</a> a design candidate for known <a href="/wiki/Constraint_optimization" class="mw-redirect" title="Constraint optimization">constraints</a> and <a href="/wiki/Goal" title="Goal">objectives</a>,</li>
<li>the design process is plan-driven,</li>
<li>the design process is understood in terms of a discrete sequence of stages.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Rational Model is based on a <a href="/wiki/Rationalism" title="Rationalism">rationalist philosophy</a> and underlies the <a href="/wiki/Waterfall_model" title="Waterfall model">waterfall model</a>, <a href="/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle" title="Systems development life cycle">systems development life cycle</a> and much of the <a href="/wiki/Engineering_design" class="mw-redirect" title="Engineering design">engineering design</a> literature. According to the rationalist philosophy, design is informed by research and knowledge in a predictable and controlled manner. Technical rationality is at the center of the process.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Example_sequence_of_stages">Example sequence of stages</span></h4>
<p>Typical stages consistent with The Rational Model include the following.</p>

<p>Each stage has many associated <a href="/wiki/Best_practices" class="mw-redirect" title="Best practices">best practices</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Criticism_of_the_Rational_Model">Criticism of the Rational Model</span></h4>
<p>The Rational Model has been widely criticized on two primary grounds</p>
<ol>
<li>Designers do not work this way&#xA0;&#x2013; extensive empirical evidence has demonstrated that designers do not act as the rational model suggests.</li>
<li>Unrealistic assumptions&#xA0;&#x2013; goals are often unknown when a design project begins, and the requirements and constraints continue to change.</li>
</ol>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Action-Centric_Model">The Action-Centric Model</span></h3>
<p>The Action-Centric Perspective is a label given to a collection of interrelated concepts, which are antithetical to The Rational Model. It posits that:</p>
<ol>
<li>designers use <a href="/wiki/Creativity" title="Creativity">creativity</a> and <a href="/wiki/Emotion" title="Emotion">emotion</a> to generate design candidates,</li>
<li>the design process is <a href="/wiki/Improvisation" title="Improvisation">improvised</a>,</li>
<li>no universal sequence of stages is apparent&#xA0;&#x2013; analysis, design and implementation are contemporary and inextricably linked</li>
</ol>
<p>The Action-Centric Perspective is based on an <a href="/wiki/Empiricism" title="Empiricism">empiricist philosophy</a> and broadly consistent with the <a href="/wiki/Agile_software_development" title="Agile software development">Agile approach</a> and amethodical development. Substantial empirical evidence supports the veracity of this perspective in describing the actions of real designers. Like the Rational Model, the Action-Centric model sees design as informed by research and knowledge. However, research and knowledge are brought into the design process through the judgment and common sense of designers&#xA0;&#x2013; by designers &quot;thinking on their feet&quot;&#xA0;&#x2013; more than through the predictable and controlled process stipulated by the Rational Model. Designers&apos; context-dependent experience and professional judgment take center stage more than technical rationality.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Descriptions_of_design_activities">Descriptions of design activities</span></h4>
<p>At least two views of design activity are consistent with the Action-Centric Perspective. Both involve three basic activities.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Reflective_practice" title="Reflective practice">Reflection-in-Action paradigm</a>, designers alternate between &quot;<a href="/wiki/Framing_(social_sciences)" title="Framing (social sciences)">framing</a>&quot;, &quot;making moves&quot;, and &quot;evaluate moves.&quot; &quot;Framing&quot; refers to conceptualizing the problem, i.e., defining goals and objectives. A &quot;move&quot; is a tentative design decision. The evaluation process may lead to further moves in the design.</p>
<p>In the Sensemaking-Coevolution-Implementation Framework, designers alternate between its three titular activities. <a href="/wiki/Sensemaking" title="Sensemaking">Sensemaking</a> includes both framing and evaluating moves. Implementation is the process of constructing the design object. Coevolution is &quot;the process where the design agent simultaneously refines its mental picture of the design object based on its mental picture of the context, and vice versa.&quot;</p>
<p>The concept of the Design Cycle is understood as a circular time structure, which may start with the thinking of an idea, then expressing it by the use of visual and/or verbal means of communication (design tools), the sharing and perceiving of the expressed idea, and finally starting a new cycle with the critical rethinking of the perceived idea. Anderson points out that this concept emphasizes the importance of the means of expression, which at the same time are means of perception of any design ideas.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Philosophies_and_studies_of_design">Philosophies and studies of design</span></h2>
<p>There are countless philosophies for guiding design as the design values and its accompanying aspects within modern design vary, both between different schools of thought and among practicing designers. Design philosophies are usually for determining design goals. A design goal may range from solving the least significant individual problem of the smallest element, to the most <a href="/wiki/Holistic" class="mw-redirect" title="Holistic">holistic</a> influential <a href="/wiki/Utopian" class="mw-redirect" title="Utopian">utopian</a> goals. Design goals are usually for guiding design. However, conflicts over immediate and minor goals may lead to questioning the purpose of design, perhaps to set better long term or ultimate goals.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Philosophies_for_guiding_design">Philosophies for guiding design</span></h3>
<p>Design philosophies are fundamental guiding principles that dictate how a designer approaches his/her practice. Reflections on <a href="/wiki/Material_culture" title="Material culture">material culture</a> and environmental concerns (<a href="/wiki/Sustainable_design" title="Sustainable design">sustainable design</a>) can guide a design philosophy. One example is the <a href="/wiki/First_Things_First_2000_manifesto" title="First Things First 2000 manifesto">First Things First manifesto</a> which was launched within the graphic design community and states &quot;We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication&#xA0;&#x2013; a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning. The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is running uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of design.&quot;</p>
<p>In <i>The Sciences of the Artificial</i> by polymath <a href="/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon" title="Herbert A. Simon">Herbert A. Simon</a> the author asserts design to be a meta-discipline of all professions. &quot;Engineers are not the only professional designers. Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones. The intellectual activity that produces material artifacts is no different fundamentally from the one that prescribes remedies for a sick patient or the one that devises a new sales plan for a company or a social welfare policy for a state. Design, so construed, is the core of all professional training; it is the principal mark that distinguishes the professions from the sciences. Schools of engineering, as well as schools of architecture, business, education, law, and medicine, are all centrally concerned with the process of design.&quot;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Approaches_to_design">Approaches to design</span></h3>
<p>A design approach is a general philosophy that may or may not include a guide for specific methods. Some are to guide the overall goal of the design. Other approaches are to guide the tendencies of the designer. A combination of approaches may be used if they don&apos;t conflict.</p>
<p>Some popular approaches include:</p>

<p>The boundaries between art and design are blurred, largely due to a range of applications both for the term &apos;art&apos; and the term &apos;design&apos;. <a href="/wiki/Applied_arts" title="Applied arts">Applied arts</a> has been used as an umbrella term to define fields of <a href="/wiki/Industrial_design" title="Industrial design">industrial design</a>, <a href="/wiki/Graphic_design" title="Graphic design">graphic design</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fashion_design" title="Fashion design">fashion design</a>, etc. The term &apos;<a href="/wiki/Decorative_arts" title="Decorative arts">decorative arts</a>&apos; is a traditional term used in historical discourses to describe craft objects, and also sits within the umbrella of <a href="/wiki/Applied_arts" title="Applied arts">Applied arts</a>. In <a href="/wiki/Graphic_art" class="mw-redirect" title="Graphic art">graphic arts</a> (2D image making that ranges from photography to illustration) the distinction is often made between <a href="/wiki/Fine_art" title="Fine art">fine art</a> and <a href="/wiki/Commercial_art" title="Commercial art">commercial art</a>, based on the context within which the work is produced and how it is traded.</p>

Mark Getlein suggests the principles of design are &quot;almost instinctive&quot;, &quot;built-in&quot;, &quot;natural&quot;, and part of &quot;our sense of &apos;rightness&apos;.&quot; However, the intended application and context of the resulting works will vary greatly.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Design_and_engineering">Design and engineering</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Engineering" title="Engineering">engineering</a>, design is a component of the engineering process. Many overlapping methods and processes can be seen when comparing <a href="/wiki/Product_design" title="Product design">Product design</a>, <a href="/wiki/Industrial_design" title="Industrial design">Industrial design</a> and <a href="/wiki/Engineering" title="Engineering">Engineering</a>. The <a href="/wiki/American_Heritage_Dictionary" class="mw-redirect" title="American Heritage Dictionary">American Heritage Dictionary</a> defines design as: <i>&quot;To conceive or fashion in the mind; invent,&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;To formulate a plan&quot;</i>, and defines engineering as: <i>&quot;The application of scientific and mathematical principles to practical ends such as the design, manufacture, and operation of efficient and economical structures, machines, processes, and systems.&quot;</i>. Both are forms of problem-solving with a defined distinction being the application of &quot;scientific and mathematical principles&quot;. The increasingly scientific focus of engineering in practice, however, has raised the importance of new more &quot;human-centered&quot; fields of design. How much science is applied in a design is a question of what is considered &quot;<a href="/wiki/Science" title="Science">science</a>&quot;. Along with the question of what is considered science, there is <a href="/wiki/Social_science" title="Social science">social science</a> versus <a href="/wiki/Natural_science" title="Natural science">natural science</a>. Scientists at <a href="/wiki/Xerox_PARC" class="mw-redirect" title="Xerox PARC">Xerox PARC</a> made the distinction of design versus engineering at &quot;moving minds&quot; versus &quot;moving atoms&quot; (probably in cotradiction to the origin of term &quot;engineering - engineer&quot; from Latin &quot;in genio&quot; in meaning of a &quot;genius&quot; what assumes existence of a &quot;mind&quot; not of an &quot;atom&quot;).</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Design_and_production">Design and production</span></h3>
<p>The relationship between design and <a href="/wiki/Production,_costs,_and_pricing" class="mw-redirect" title="Production, costs, and pricing">production</a> is one of planning and executing. In theory, the plan should anticipate and compensate for potential problems in the execution process. Design involves problem-solving and <a href="/wiki/Creativity" title="Creativity">creativity</a>. In contrast, production involves a routine or pre-planned process. A design may also be a mere plan that does not include a production or engineering processes although a working knowledge of such processes is usually expected of designers. In some cases, it may be unnecessary and/or impractical to expect a designer with a broad <a href="/wiki/Multidisciplinary" class="mw-redirect" title="Multidisciplinary">multidisciplinary</a> knowledge required for such designs to also have a detailed <a href="/wiki/Division_of_labour" title="Division of labour">specialized</a> knowledge of how to produce the product.</p>
<p>Design and production are intertwined in many <a href="/wiki/Creative_professional" title="Creative professional">creative professional</a> careers, meaning problem-solving is part of execution and the reverse. As the cost of rearrangement increases, the need for separating design from production increases as well. For example, a high-budget project, such as a <a href="/wiki/Skyscraper" title="Skyscraper">skyscraper</a>, requires separating (design) <a href="/wiki/Architect" title="Architect">architecture</a> from (production) <a href="/wiki/Construction" title="Construction">construction</a>. A Low-budget project, such as a <a href="/wiki/Multifunction_printer" class="mw-redirect" title="Multifunction printer">locally printed</a> office party invitation <a href="/wiki/Flyer_(pamphlet)" title="Flyer (pamphlet)">flyer</a>, can be rearranged and printed dozens of times at the low cost of a few sheets of paper, a few drops of ink, and less than one hour&apos;s pay of a <a href="/wiki/Desktop_publishing" title="Desktop publishing">desktop publisher</a>.</p>
<p>This is not to say that production never involves problem-solving or creativity, nor that design always involves creativity. Designs are rarely perfect and are sometimes repetitive. The imperfection of a design may task a production position (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Production_artist" title="Production artist">production artist</a>, <a href="/wiki/Construction_worker" title="Construction worker">construction worker</a>) with utilizing creativity or problem-solving skills to compensate for what was overlooked in the design process. Likewise, a design may be a simple repetition (copy) of a known preexisting solution, requiring minimal, if any, creativity or problem-solving skills from the designer.</p>
