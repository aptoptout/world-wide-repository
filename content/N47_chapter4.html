An increasing percentage of this is due to low density urban sprawl which is extending into natural areas.

Countries accede to the union by becoming party to the founding <a href="/wiki/Treaties_of_the_European_Union" title="Treaties of the European Union">treaties</a>, thereby subjecting themselves to the privileges and obligations of EU membership.

Over the past 50 years, an increasingly dense network of legislation has been created, extending to all areas of environmental protection, including air pollution, water quality, waste management, nature conservation, and the control of chemicals, industrial hazards and biotechnology. According to the <a href="/wiki/Institute_for_European_Environmental_Policy" title="Institute for European Environmental Policy">Institute for European Environmental Policy</a>, environmental law comprises over 500 Directives, Regulations and Decisions, making environmental policy a core area of European politics.</p><p>European policy-makers originally increased the EU&apos;s capacity to act on environmental issues by defining it as a trade problem. <a href="/wiki/Trade_barrier" title="Trade barrier">Trade barriers</a> and competitive distortions in the Common Market could emerge due to the different environmental standards in each member state. In subsequent years, the environment became a formal policy area, with its own policy actors, principles and procedures. The legal basis for EU environmental policy was established with the introduction of the Single European Act in 1987.</p><p>Initially, EU environmental policy focused on Europe. More recently, the EU has demonstrated leadership in global environmental governance, e.g. the role of the EU in securing the ratification and coming into force of the <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a> despite opposition from the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>. This international dimension is reflected in the EU&apos;s Sixth Environmental Action Programme, which recognises that its objectives can only be achieved if key international agreements are actively supported and properly implemented both at EU level and worldwide. The Lisbon Treaty further strengthened the leadership ambitions. EU law has played a significant role in improving habitat and species protection in Europe, as well as contributing to improvements in air and water quality and waste management.</p><p>Mitigating <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a> is one of the top priorities of EU environmental policy. In 2007, member states agreed that, in future, 20% of the energy used across the EU must be <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable</a>, and carbon dioxide emissions have to be lower in 2020 by at least 20% compared to 1990 levels.

Generally speaking, they can be classified into two groups: those which come into force without the necessity for national implementation measures (regulations) and those which specifically require national implementation measures (directives).</p><p>The classification of the EU in terms of international or constitutional law has been much debated. It began life as an international organisation and gradually developed into a <a href="/wiki/Confederation" title="Confederation">confederation</a> of states. However, since the mid-1960s it has also added several of the key attributes of a <a href="/wiki/Federation" title="Federation">federation</a>, such as the direct effect of the law of the general level of government upon the individual and majority voting in the decision-making process of the general level of government, without becoming a federation <i>per se</i>. Scholars thus today see it as an intermediate form lying between a confederation and a federation, being an instance of neither political structure. For this reason, the organisation is termed <i><a href="/wiki/Sui_generis" title="Sui generis">sui generis</a></i> (incomparable, one of a kind), although some argue that this designation is no longer valid.</p><p>The organisation has traditionally used the terms &quot;Community&quot; and later &quot;Union&quot; to describe itself. The difficulties of classification involve the difference between national law (where the subjects of the law include natural persons and corporations) and <a href="/wiki/International_law" title="International law">international law</a> (where the subjects include sovereign states and international organizations). They can also be seen in the light of differing European and American constitutional traditions. Especially in terms of the European tradition, the term federation is equated with a sovereign <a href="/wiki/Federal_state" class="mw-redirect" title="Federal state">federal state</a> in international law; so the EU cannot be called a federation &#x2014; at least, not without qualification. It is, however, described as being based on a federal model or federal in nature; and so it may be appropriate to consider it a <a href="/wiki/Federalism" title="Federalism">federal union of states</a>, a conceptual structure lying between the confederation of states and the federal state. The German Constitutional Court refers to the EU as a <i><a href="/wiki/Staatenverbund" title="Staatenverbund">Staatenverbund</a></i>, an intermediate structure between the <i>Staatenbund</i> (confederation of states) and the <i>Bundesstaat</i> (federal state), consistent with this concept. This may be a long-lived political form. Professor Andrew Moravcsik claims that the EU is unlikely to develop further into a federal state, but instead has reached maturity as a constitutional system.</p><p>The European Union has seven institutions: the <a href="/wiki/European_Council" title="European Council">European Council</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_the_European_Union" title="Council of the European Union">Council of the European Union</a>, the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a>, the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Court_of_Justice_of_the_European_Union" title="Court of Justice of the European Union">Court of Justice of the European Union</a>, the <a href="/wiki/European_Central_Bank" title="European Central Bank">European Central Bank</a> and the <a href="/wiki/European_Court_of_Auditors" title="European Court of Auditors">European Court of Auditors</a>.

By comparison, the United Kingdom&apos;s expenditure for 2004 was estimated to be &#x20AC;759&#xA0;billion, and France was estimated to have spent &#x20AC;801&#xA0;billion. In 1960, the budget of the then European Economic Community was 0.03% of GDP.</p><p>In the 2010 budget of &#x20AC;141.5&#xA0;billion, the largest single expenditure item is &quot;<i><a href="/wiki/Structural_Funds_and_Cohesion_Fund" title="Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund">cohesion &amp; competitiveness</a></i>&quot; with around 45% of the total budget.

The Court also gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions. The Parliament uses this to decide whether to approve the Commission&apos;s handling of the budget.</p><p>The European Court of Auditors has signed off the European Union accounts every year since 2007 and, while making it clear that the European Commission has more work to do, has highlighted that most of the errors take place at national level. In their report on 2009 the auditors found that five areas of Union expenditure, <a href="/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy" title="Common Agricultural Policy">agriculture</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Structural_Funds_and_Cohesion_Fund" title="Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund">cohesion fund</a>, were materially affected by error. The European Commission estimated in 2009 that the financial impact of irregularities was &#x20AC;1,863&#xA0;million.</p><p>EU member states retain all powers not explicitly handed to the European Union. In some areas the EU enjoys exclusive competence. These are areas in which member states have renounced any capacity to enact legislation. In other areas the EU and its member states share the competence to legislate. While both can legislate, member states can only legislate to the extent to which the EU has not. In other policy areas the EU can only co-ordinate, support and supplement member state action but cannot enact legislation with the aim of harmonising national laws.</p><p>That a particular policy area falls into a certain category of competence is not necessarily indicative of what <a href="/wiki/Legislature_of_the_European_Union" class="mw-redirect" title="Legislature of the European Union">legislative procedure</a> is used for enacting legislation within that policy area. Different legislative procedures are used within the same category of competence, and even with the same policy area.</p><p>The distribution of competences in various policy areas between Member States and the Union is divided in the following three categories:</p><p>The EU is based on a series of <a href="/wiki/Treaties_of_the_European_Union" title="Treaties of the European Union">treaties</a>. These first established the European Community and the EU, and then made amendments to those founding treaties. These are power-giving treaties which set broad policy goals and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals. These legal powers include the ability to enact legislation which can directly affect all member states and their inhabitants. The EU has <a href="/wiki/Legal_personality" title="Legal personality">legal personality</a>, with the right to sign agreements and international treaties.</p><p>Under the principle of <a href="/wiki/Supremacy_(European_Union_law)" class="mw-redirect" title="Supremacy (European Union law)">supremacy</a>, national courts are required to enforce the treaties that their member states have ratified, and thus the laws enacted under them, even if doing so requires them to ignore conflicting national law, and (within limits) even constitutional provisions.</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Judiciary" title="Judiciary">judicial branch</a> of the EU&#x2014;formally called the <a href="/wiki/Court_of_Justice_of_the_European_Union" title="Court of Justice of the European Union">Court of Justice of the European Union</a>&#x2014;consists of three courts: the <a href="/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice" title="European Court of Justice">Court of Justice</a>, the <a href="/wiki/General_Court_(European_Union)" title="General Court (European Union)">General Court</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/European_Union_Civil_Service_Tribunal" title="European Union Civil Service Tribunal">European Union Civil Service Tribunal</a>. Together they interpret and apply the treaties and the law of the EU.</p><p>The Court of Justice primarily deals with cases taken by member states, the institutions, and <a href="/wiki/Preliminary_ruling" title="Preliminary ruling">cases referred to it</a> by the courts of member states. The General Court mainly deals with cases taken by individuals and companies directly before the EU&apos;s courts, and the European Union Civil Service Tribunal adjudicates in disputes between the European Union and <a href="/wiki/European_Civil_Service" title="European Civil Service">its civil service</a>. Decisions from the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice but only on a point of law.</p><p>The treaties declare that the EU itself is &quot;founded on the values of respect for <a href="/wiki/Human_dignity" class="mw-redirect" title="Human dignity">human dignity</a>, <a href="/wiki/Liberty" title="Liberty">freedom</a>, democracy, <a href="/wiki/Equality_before_the_law" title="Equality before the law">equality</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Rule_of_law" title="Rule of law">rule of law</a> and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to <a href="/wiki/Minority_group" title="Minority group">minorities</a>&#xA0;... in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail.&quot;</p><p>In 2009 the <a href="/wiki/Lisbon_Treaty" class="mw-redirect" title="Lisbon Treaty">Lisbon Treaty</a> gave legal effect to the <a href="/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union" title="Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union">Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a>. The charter is a codified catalogue of <a href="/wiki/Fundamental_right" class="mw-redirect" title="Fundamental right">fundamental rights</a> against which the EU&apos;s legal acts can be judged. It consolidates many rights which were previously recognised by the Court of Justice and derived from the &quot;constitutional traditions common to the member states.&quot; The Court of Justice has long recognised fundamental rights and has, on occasion, invalidated EU legislation based on its failure to adhere to those fundamental rights.</p><p>Although signing the <a href="/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights" title="European Convention on Human Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a> (ECHR) is a condition for EU membership, previously, the EU itself could not accede to the Convention as it is neither a state nor had the competence to accede. The Lisbon Treaty and Protocol 14 to the ECHR have changed this: the former binds the EU to accede to the Convention while the latter formally permits it.</p><p>Although, the EU is independent from Council of Europe, they share purpose and ideas especially on rule of law, human rights and democracy. Further <a href="/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights" title="European Convention on Human Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a> and <a href="/wiki/European_Social_Charter" title="European Social Charter">European Social Charter</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Source_of_law" class="mw-redirect" title="Source of law">source of law</a> of <a href="/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union" title="Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union">Charter of Fundamental Rights</a> are created by Council of Europe. The EU also promoted human rights issues in the wider world. The EU opposes the death penalty and has proposed its worldwide abolition. Abolition of the death penalty is a condition for EU membership.</p><p>The main legal acts of the EU come in three forms: <a href="/wiki/Regulation_(European_Union)" title="Regulation (European Union)">regulations</a>, <a href="/wiki/Directive_(European_Union)" title="Directive (European Union)">directives</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Decision_(European_Union)" title="Decision (European Union)">decisions</a>. Regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force, without the requirement for any implementing measures, and automatically override conflicting domestic provisions. Directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result. The details of how they are to be implemented are left to member states. When the time limit for implementing directives passes, they may, under certain conditions, have <a href="/wiki/Direct_effect" class="mw-redirect" title="Direct effect">direct effect</a> in national law against member states.</p><p>Decisions offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation. They are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals, companies or a particular member state. They are most often used in <a href="/wiki/Competition_law" title="Competition law">competition law</a>, or on rulings on State Aid, but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions. Regulations, directives, and decisions are of equal legal value and apply without any formal hierarchy.</p><p>Since the creation of the EU in 1993, it has developed its competencies in the area of freedom, security and justice, initially at an intergovernmental level and later by supranationalism. To this end, agencies have been established that co-ordinate associated actions: <a href="/wiki/Europol" title="Europol">Europol</a> for co-operation of police forces, <a href="/wiki/Eurojust" title="Eurojust">Eurojust</a> for co-operation between prosecutors, and <a href="/wiki/Frontex" title="Frontex">Frontex</a> for co-operation between border control authorities. The EU also operates the <a href="/wiki/Schengen_Information_System" title="Schengen Information System">Schengen Information System</a> which provides a common database for police and immigration authorities. This co-operation had to particularly be developed with the advent of open borders through the <a href="/wiki/Schengen_Agreement" title="Schengen Agreement">Schengen Agreement</a> and the associated cross border crime.</p><p>Furthermore, the Union has legislated in areas such as <a href="/wiki/European_Arrest_Warrant" title="European Arrest Warrant">extradition</a>, family law, asylum law, and criminal justice. Prohibitions against sexual and nationality discrimination have a long standing in the treaties. In more recent years, these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race, religion, disability, age, and sexual orientation. By virtue of these powers, the EU has enacted legislation on <a href="/wiki/Sexism" title="Sexism">sexual discrimination</a> in the work-place, <a href="/wiki/Ageism" title="Ageism">age discrimination</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Racism" title="Racism">racial discrimination</a>.</p><p>Foreign policy co-operation between member states dates from the establishment of the Community in 1957, when member states negotiated as a bloc in international trade negotiations under the Common <a href="/wiki/Commercial_policy" title="Commercial policy">Commercial policy</a>. Steps for a more wide ranging co-ordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of <a href="/wiki/European_Political_Cooperation" title="European Political Cooperation">European Political Cooperation</a> which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies. It was not, however, until 1987 when European Political Cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the <a href="/wiki/Single_European_Act" title="Single European Act">Single European Act</a>.

The CFSP requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue. The unanimity and difficult issues treated under the CFSP sometimes lead to disagreements, such as those which occurred over the <a href="/wiki/Iraq_War" title="Iraq War">war in Iraq</a>.</p><p>The coordinator and representative of the CFSP within the EU is the <a href="/wiki/High_Representative_of_the_Union_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Security_Policy" title="High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy">High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy</a> who speaks on behalf of the EU in foreign policy and defence matters, and has the task of articulating the positions expressed by the member states on these fields of policy into a common alignment.

The single market involves <a href="/wiki/Internal_market" title="Internal market">the free circulation of goods, capital, people, and services within the EU</a>, and the customs union involves the application of a <a href="/wiki/Common_external_tariff" title="Common external tariff">common external tariff</a> on all goods entering the market.

Until the drive towards <a href="/wiki/Economic_and_monetary_union" title="Economic and monetary union">economic and monetary union</a> the development of the capital provisions had been slow. Post-Maastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of ECJ judgements regarding this initially neglected freedom. The free movement of capital is unique insofar as it is granted equally to non-member states.</p><p>The free movement of persons means that <a href="/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_European_Union" title="Citizenship of the European Union">EU citizens</a> can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country. This required the lowering of administrative formalities and recognition of professional qualifications of other states.</p><p>The free movement of services and of establishment allows self-employed persons to move between member states to provide services on a temporary or permanent basis. While services account for 60&#x2013;70% of GDP, legislation in the area is not as developed as in other areas. This lacuna has been addressed by the recently passed <a href="/wiki/Directive_on_services_in_the_internal_market" class="mw-redirect" title="Directive on services in the internal market">Directive on services in the internal market</a> which aims to liberalise the cross border provision of services. According to the Treaty the provision of services is a residual freedom that only applies if no other freedom is being exercised.</p><p>The creation of a <a href="/wiki/European_Currency_Unit" title="European Currency Unit">European single currency</a> became an official objective of the European Economic Community in 1969. In 1992, having negotiated the structure and procedures of a currency union, the member states signed the <a href="/wiki/Maastricht_Treaty" title="Maastricht Treaty">Maastricht Treaty</a> and were legally bound to fulfil the agreed-on rules including the <a href="/wiki/Euro_convergence_criteria" title="Euro convergence criteria">convergence criteria</a> if they wanted to join the <a href="/wiki/Currency_union" title="Currency union">monetary union</a>.

In 2002, the currency was fully put into place, when <a href="/wiki/Euro_banknotes" title="Euro banknotes">euro notes</a> and coins were issued and national currencies began to phase out in the eurozone, which by then consisted of 12 member states. The eurozone (constituted by the EU member states which have adopted the euro) has since grown to 19 countries.</p><p>Since its launch the euro has become the second <a href="/wiki/Reserve_currency" title="Reserve currency">reserve currency</a> in the world with a quarter of foreign exchanges reserves being in euro. The euro, and the monetary policies of those who have adopted it in agreement with the EU, are under the control of the <a href="/wiki/European_Central_Bank" title="European Central Bank">European Central Bank</a> (ECB).</p><p>The ECB is the central bank for the eurozone, and thus controls <a href="/wiki/Monetary_policy" title="Monetary policy">monetary policy</a> in that area with an agenda to maintain <a href="/wiki/Price_stability" class="mw-redirect" title="Price stability">price stability</a>. It is at the centre of the <a href="/wiki/European_System_of_Central_Banks" title="European System of Central Banks">European System of Central Banks</a>, which comprehends all EU national central banks and is controlled by its General Council, consisting of the <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_European_Central_Bank" title="President of the European Central Bank">President of the ECB</a>, who is appointed by the European Council, the Vice-President of the ECB, and the governors of the national central banks of all 28 EU member states.</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/European_System_of_Financial_Supervision" title="European System of Financial Supervision">European System of Financial Supervision</a> is an institutional architecture of the EU&apos;s framework of financial supervision composed by three authorities: the <a href="/wiki/European_Banking_Authority" title="European Banking Authority">European Banking Authority</a>, the <a href="/wiki/European_Insurance_and_Occupational_Pensions_Authority" title="European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority">European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority</a> and the <a href="/wiki/European_Securities_and_Markets_Authority" title="European Securities and Markets Authority">European Securities and Markets Authority</a>.

The aim of this financial control system is to ensure the economic stability of the EU.</p><p>To prevent the joining states from getting into financial trouble or crisis after entering the monetary union, they were obliged in the Maastricht treaty to fulfil important financial obligations and procedures, especially to show budgetary discipline and a high degree of sustainable economic convergence, as well as to avoid excessive government deficits and limit the government debt to a sustainable level.</p><p>In 2006, the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Accession_2005" title="Treaty of Accession 2005">EU-27</a> had a gross inland energy consumption of 1,825&#xA0;million tonnes of oil equivalent (toe).

In the pre-2004 EU members, the major problem in transport deals with congestion and pollution. After the recent enlargement, the new states that joined since 2004 added the problem of solving accessibility to the transport agenda.

The policy has the objectives of increasing agricultural production, providing certainty in food supplies, ensuring a high quality of life for farmers, stabilising markets, and ensuring reasonable prices for consumers. It was, until recently, operated by a system of subsidies and market intervention. Until the 1990s, the policy accounted for over 60% of the then <a href="/wiki/European_Economic_Community" title="European Economic Community">European Community</a>&apos;s annual budget, and as of 2013 accounts for around 34%.</p><p>The policy&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Incomes_policy" title="Incomes policy">price controls</a> and market interventions led to considerable overproduction. These were <a href="/wiki/Buffer_stock_scheme" title="Buffer stock scheme">intervention stores</a> of products bought up by the Community to maintain minimum price levels. To dispose of surplus stores, they were often sold on the world market at prices considerably below Community guaranteed prices, or farmers were offered subsidies (amounting to the difference between the Community and world prices) to export their products outside the Community. This system has been criticised for under-cutting farmers outside Europe, especially those in the <a href="/wiki/Third_World" title="Third World">developing world</a>. Supporters of CAP argue that the economic support which it gives to farmers provides them with a reasonable standard of living.</p><p>Since the beginning of the 1990s, the CAP has been subject to a series of reforms. Initially, these reforms included the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Set-aside" title="Set-aside">set-aside</a> in 1988, where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production, milk quotas and, more recently, the &apos;de-coupling&apos; (or disassociation) of the money farmers receive from the EU and the amount they produce (by the Fischler reforms in 2004). Agriculture expenditure will move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce, toward direct payments based on farm size. This is intended to allow the market to dictate production levels. One of these reforms entailed the abolition of the EU&apos;s sugar regime, which previously divided the sugar market between member states and certain African-Caribbean nations with a privileged relationship with the EU.</p><p>The EU operates a <a href="/wiki/European_Union_competition_law" title="European Union competition law">competition policy</a> intended to ensure undistorted competition within the single market.

Many countries have experienced falling church attendance and membership in recent years. The countries where the fewest people reported a religious belief were Estonia (16%) and the Czech Republic (19%). The most religious countries were Malta (95%, predominantly Roman Catholic) as well as Cyprus and Romania (both predominantly Orthodox) each with about 90% of citizens professing a belief in God. Across the EU, belief was higher among women, older people, those with religious upbringing, those who left school at 15 or 16 and those &quot;positioning themselves on the right of the political scale&quot;.</p><p>Basic education is an area where the EU&apos;s role is limited to supporting national governments. In higher education, the policy was developed in the 1980s in programmes supporting exchanges and mobility. The most visible of these has been the <a href="/wiki/Erasmus_Programme" title="Erasmus Programme">Erasmus Programme</a>, a university exchange programme which began in 1987. In its first 20&#xA0;years, it has supported international exchange opportunities for well over 1.5&#xA0;million university and college students and has become a symbol of European student life.</p><p>There are now similar programmes for school pupils and teachers, for trainees in <a href="/wiki/Vocational_education" title="Vocational education">vocational education and training</a>, and for adult learners in the <a href="/wiki/Lifelong_Learning_Programme_2007%E2%80%932013" title="Lifelong Learning Programme 2007&#x2013;2013">Lifelong Learning Programme 2007&#x2013;2013</a>. These programmes are designed to encourage a wider knowledge of other countries and to spread good practices in the education and training fields across the EU. Through its support of the <a href="/wiki/Bologna_Process" title="Bologna Process">Bologna Process</a>, the EU is supporting comparable standards and compatible degrees across Europe.</p><p>Scientific development is facilitated through the EU&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Framework_Programmes_for_Research_and_Technological_Development" title="Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development">Framework Programmes</a>, the first of which started in 1984. The aims of EU policy in this area are to co-ordinate and stimulate research. The independent <a href="/wiki/European_Research_Council" title="European Research Council">European Research Council</a> allocates EU funds to European or national research projects. EU <a href="/wiki/Framework_Programmes_for_Research_and_Technological_Development" title="Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development">research and technological framework programmes</a> deal in a number of areas, for example energy where the aim is to develop a diverse mix of <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> to help the environment and to reduce dependence on imported fuels.</p><p>Although the EU has no major competences in the field of health care, Article 35 of the <a href="/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union" title="Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union">Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a> affirms that &quot;A high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities&quot;.

The systems are primarily <a href="/wiki/Publicly_funded_health_care" title="Publicly funded health care">publicly funded</a> through taxation (universal health care). Private funding for health care may represent personal contributions towards meeting the non-taxpayer refunded portion of health care or may reflect totally private (non-subsidised) health care either paid out of pocket or met by some form of personal or employer funded insurance.</p><p>All EU and many other European countries offer their citizens a free <a href="/wiki/European_Health_Insurance_Card" title="European Health Insurance Card">European Health Insurance Card</a> which, on a reciprocal basis, provides insurance for emergency medical treatment insurance when visiting other participating European countries. A directive on cross-border healthcare aims at promoting co-operation on health care between member states and facilitating access to safe and high-quality cross-border healthcare for European patients.</p><p>Cultural co-operation between member states has been a concern of the EU since its inclusion as a community competency in the Maastricht Treaty. Actions taken in the cultural area by the EU include the <a href="/wiki/Culture_2000" title="Culture 2000">Culture 2000</a> 7-year programme, the <a href="/wiki/European_Cultural_Month" title="European Cultural Month">European Cultural Month</a> event, the <a href="/wiki/MEDIA_Programme" title="MEDIA Programme">MEDIA Programme</a>, and orchestras such as the <a href="/wiki/European_Union_Youth_Orchestra" title="European Union Youth Orchestra">European Union Youth Orchestra</a>.</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/European_Capital_of_Culture" title="European Capital of Culture">European Capital of Culture</a> programme selects one or more cities in every year to assist the <a href="/wiki/Sociocultural_evolution" title="Sociocultural evolution">cultural development</a> of that city. 53 EU cities have been part of this initiative up to 2016.</p><p>Sport is mainly the responsibility of the member states or other international organisations, rather than of the EU. However, there are some EU policies that have had an impact on sport, such as the free movement of workers, which was at the core of the <a href="/wiki/Bosman_ruling" title="Bosman ruling">Bosman ruling</a> that prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with European citizenship. The <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Lisbon" title="Treaty of Lisbon">Treaty of Lisbon</a> requires any application of economic rules to take into account the specific nature of sport and its structures based on voluntary activity. This followed lobbying by governing organisations such as the <a href="/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee" title="International Olympic Committee">International Olympic Committee</a> and <a href="/wiki/FIFA" title="FIFA">FIFA</a>, due to objections over the application of free market principles to sport, which led to an increasing gap between rich and poor clubs. The EU does fund a programme for Israeli, Jordanian, Irish, and British football coaches, as part of the Football 4 Peace project.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Association_Football" class="mw-redirect" title="Association Football">Association Football</a> is the most popular sport in almost all EU countries.

Originally designed in 1955 for the Council of Europe, the flag was adopted by the <a href="/wiki/European_Communities" title="European Communities">European Communities</a>, the predecessors of the present Union, in 1986.</p><p><i><a href="/wiki/Motto_of_the_European_Union" title="Motto of the European Union">United in Diversity</a></i> was adopted as the motto of the Union in the year 2000, having been selected from <a href="/wiki/A_motto_for_Europe" class="mw-redirect" title="A motto for Europe">proposals</a> submitted by school pupils. Since 1985, the <a href="/wiki/Flag_day" class="mw-redirect" title="Flag day">flag day</a> of the Union has been <a href="/wiki/Europe_Day" title="Europe Day">Europe Day</a>, on 9 May (the date of the 1950 <a href="/wiki/Schuman_declaration" class="mw-redirect" title="Schuman declaration">Schuman declaration</a>). The <a href="/wiki/Anthem_of_Europe" title="Anthem of Europe">anthem of the Union</a> is an instrumental version of the prelude to the <i><a href="/wiki/Ode_to_Joy" title="Ode to Joy">Ode to Joy</a></i>, the 4th movement of <a href="/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven" title="Ludwig van Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a>&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Symphony_No._9_(Beethoven)" title="Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)">ninth symphony</a>.
