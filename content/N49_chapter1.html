<p><b>Climate</b> is the statistics (usually, <a href="/wiki/Mean" title="Mean">mean</a> or <a href="/wiki/Statistical_dispersion" title="Statistical dispersion">variability</a>) of <a href="/wiki/Weather" title="Weather">weather</a>, usually over a 30-year interval.

Climate differs from <a href="/wiki/Weather" title="Weather">weather</a>, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.</p><p>A region&apos;s climate is generated by the <b>climate system</b>, which has five components: <a href="/wiki/Earth%27s_Atmosphere" class="mw-redirect" title="Earth&apos;s Atmosphere">atmosphere</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hydrosphere" title="Hydrosphere">hydrosphere</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cryosphere" title="Cryosphere">cryosphere</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lithosphere" title="Lithosphere">lithosphere</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Biosphere" title="Biosphere">biosphere</a>.</p><p>The climate of a location is affected by its <a href="/wiki/Latitude" title="Latitude">latitude</a>, <a href="/wiki/Terrain" title="Terrain">terrain</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Altitude" title="Altitude">altitude</a>, as well as nearby <a href="/wiki/Body_of_water" title="Body of water">water bodies</a> and their currents. Climates can be <a href="/wiki/Climate_classification" title="Climate classification">classified</a> according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme was <a href="/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification" title="K&#xF6;ppen climate classification">K&#xF6;ppen climate classification</a> originally developed by <a href="/wiki/Wladimir_K%C3%B6ppen" title="Wladimir K&#xF6;ppen">Wladimir K&#xF6;ppen</a>. The Thornthwaite system, in use since 1948, incorporates <a href="/wiki/Evapotranspiration" title="Evapotranspiration">evapotranspiration</a> along with temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying biological diversity and the potential effects on it of climate changes. The Bergeron and <a href="/wiki/Spatial_Synoptic_Classification_system" title="Spatial Synoptic Classification system">Spatial Synoptic Classification systems</a> focus on the origin of air masses that define the climate of a region.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Paleoclimatology" title="Paleoclimatology">Paleoclimatology</a> is the study of ancient climates.

The standard averaging period is 30&#xA0;years, but other periods may be used depending on the purpose. Climate also includes statistics other than the average, such as the magnitudes of day-to-day or year-to-year variations. The <a href="/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change" title="Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC) <a href="/wiki/IPCC_Third_Assessment_Report" title="IPCC Third Assessment Report">2001</a> glossary definition is as follows:</p><p><i>Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the &quot;average weather,&quot; or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30&#xA0;years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system.</i></p><p>The <a href="/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization" title="World Meteorological Organization">World Meteorological Organization</a> (WMO) describes climate &quot;normals&quot; as &quot;reference points used by climatologists to compare current climatological trends to that of the past or what is considered &apos;normal&apos;. A Normal is defined as the arithmetic average of a climate element (e.g. temperature) over a 30-year period. A 30 year period is used, as it is long enough to filter out any interannual variation or anomalies, but also short enough to be able to show longer climatic trends.&quot; The WMO originated from the <a href="/wiki/International_Meteorological_Organization" title="International Meteorological Organization">International Meteorological Organization</a> which set up a technical commission for climatology in 1929. At its 1934 <a href="/wiki/Wiesbaden" title="Wiesbaden">Wiesbaden</a> meeting the technical commission designated the thirty-year period from 1901 to 1930 as the reference time frame for climatological standard normals. In 1982 the WMO agreed to update climate normals, and in these were subsequently completed on the basis of climate data from 1 January 1961 to 31 December 1990.</p><p>The difference between climate and weather is usefully summarized by the popular phrase &quot;Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get.&quot; Over <a href="/wiki/History" title="History">historical</a> time spans there are a number of nearly constant variables that determine climate, including <a href="/wiki/Latitude" title="Latitude">latitude</a>, altitude, proportion of land to water, and proximity to oceans and mountains. These change only over periods of millions of years due to processes such as <a href="/wiki/Plate_tectonics" title="Plate tectonics">plate tectonics</a>. Other climate determinants are more dynamic: the <a href="/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation" title="Thermohaline circulation">thermohaline circulation</a> of the ocean leads to a 5&#xA0;&#xB0;C (9&#xA0;&#xB0;F) warming of the northern <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> compared to other ocean basins. Other <a href="/wiki/Ocean_current" title="Ocean current">ocean currents</a> redistribute heat between land and water on a more regional scale. The density and type of vegetation coverage affects solar heat absorption, water retention, and rainfall on a regional level. Alterations in the quantity of atmospheric <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gases</a> determines the amount of solar energy retained by the planet, leading to <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a> or <a href="/wiki/Global_cooling" title="Global cooling">global cooling</a>. The variables which determine climate are numerous and the interactions complex, but there is general agreement that the broad outlines are understood, at least insofar as the determinants of historical climate change are concerned.</p><p>There are several ways to <a href="/wiki/Climate_classification" title="Climate classification">classify climates</a> into similar regimes. Originally, <a href="/wiki/Clime" title="Clime">climes</a> were defined in <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greece</a> to describe the weather depending upon a location&apos;s latitude. Modern climate classification methods can be broadly divided into <i>genetic</i> methods, which focus on the causes of climate, and <i>empiric</i> methods, which focus on the effects of climate. Examples of genetic classification include methods based on the <a href="/wiki/Relative_frequency" class="mw-redirect" title="Relative frequency">relative frequency</a> of different <a href="/wiki/Air_mass" title="Air mass">air mass</a> types or locations within <a href="/wiki/Synoptic_scale_meteorology" title="Synoptic scale meteorology">synoptic</a> weather disturbances. Examples of <a href="/wiki/Empirical" class="mw-redirect" title="Empirical">empiric</a> classifications include <a href="/wiki/Climate_zone" class="mw-redirect" title="Climate zone">climate zones</a> defined by <a href="/wiki/Plant_hardiness" class="mw-redirect" title="Plant hardiness">plant hardiness</a>, evapotranspiration, or more generally the <a href="/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification" title="K&#xF6;ppen climate classification">K&#xF6;ppen climate classification</a> which was originally designed to identify the climates associated with certain <a href="/wiki/Biome" title="Biome">biomes</a>. A common shortcoming of these <a href="/wiki/Classification_scheme" title="Classification scheme">classification schemes</a> is that they produce distinct boundaries between the zones they define, rather than the gradual transition of climate properties more common in nature.</p><p>The simplest classification is that involving air masses. The Bergeron classification is the most widely accepted form of air mass classification. Air mass classification involves three letters. The first letter describes its <a href="/wiki/Moisture" title="Moisture">moisture</a> properties, with c used for continental air masses (dry) and m for maritime air masses (moist). The second letter describes the thermal characteristic of its source region: T for <a href="/wiki/Tropical" class="mw-redirect" title="Tropical">tropical</a>, P for <a href="/wiki/Polar_region" class="mw-redirect" title="Polar region">polar</a>, A for <a href="/wiki/Arctic" title="Arctic">Arctic</a> or Antarctic, M for <a href="/wiki/Monsoon" title="Monsoon">monsoon</a>, E for <a href="/wiki/Equatorial_climate" class="mw-redirect" title="Equatorial climate">equatorial</a>, and S for superior air (dry air formed by significant downward motion in the atmosphere). The third letter is used to designate the stability of the atmosphere. If the air mass is colder than the ground below it, it is labeled k. If the air mass is warmer than the ground below it, it is labeled w. While air mass identification was originally used in <a href="/wiki/Weather_forecasting" title="Weather forecasting">weather forecasting</a> during the 1950s, climatologists began to establish synoptic climatologies based on this idea in 1973.</p><p>Based upon the Bergeron classification scheme is the <a href="/wiki/Spatial_Synoptic_Classification_system" title="Spatial Synoptic Classification system">Spatial Synoptic Classification system</a> (SSC). There are six categories within the SSC scheme: Dry Polar (similar to continental polar), Dry Moderate (similar to maritime superior), Dry Tropical (similar to continental tropical), Moist Polar (similar to maritime polar), Moist Moderate (a hybrid between maritime polar and maritime tropical), and Moist Tropical (similar to maritime tropical, maritime monsoon, or maritime equatorial).</p><p>The K&#xF6;ppen classification depends on average monthly values of temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used form of the K&#xF6;ppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. These primary types are A, tropical; B, dry; C, mild mid-latitude; D, cold mid-latitude; and E, polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as <a href="/wiki/Rain_forest" class="mw-redirect" title="Rain forest">rain forest</a>, <a href="/wiki/Monsoon" title="Monsoon">monsoon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tropical_savanna" class="mw-redirect" title="Tropical savanna">tropical savanna</a>, <a href="/wiki/Humid_subtropical" class="mw-redirect" title="Humid subtropical">humid subtropical</a>, <a href="/wiki/Humid_continental" class="mw-redirect" title="Humid continental">humid continental</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oceanic_climate" title="Oceanic climate">oceanic climate</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_climate" title="Mediterranean climate">Mediterranean climate</a>, <a href="/wiki/Steppe" title="Steppe">steppe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Subarctic_climate" title="Subarctic climate">subarctic climate</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tundra" title="Tundra">tundra</a>, <a href="/wiki/Polar_ice_cap" title="Polar ice cap">polar ice cap</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Desert" title="Desert">desert</a>.</p><p><b>Rain forests</b> are characterized by high <a href="/wiki/Rainfall" class="mw-redirect" title="Rainfall">rainfall</a>, with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between 1,750 millimetres (69&#xA0;in) and 2,000 millimetres (79&#xA0;in).

W. Thornthwaite">C. W. Thornthwaite</a>, this climate classification method monitors the soil water budget using evapotranspiration. It monitors the portion of total precipitation used to nourish vegetation over a certain area. It uses indices such as a humidity index and an aridity index to determine an area&apos;s moisture regime based upon its average temperature, average rainfall, and average vegetation type. The lower the value of the index in any given area, the drier the area is.</p><p>The moisture classification includes climatic classes with descriptors such as hyperhumid, humid, subhumid, subarid, semi-arid (values of &#x2212;20 to &#x2212;40), and arid (values below &#x2212;40). Humid regions experience more precipitation than evaporation each year, while arid regions experience greater evaporation than precipitation on an annual basis. A total of 33&#xA0;percent of the Earth&apos;s landmass is considered either arid of semi-arid, including southwest North America, southwest South America, most of northern and a small part of southern Africa, southwest and portions of eastern Asia, as well as much of Australia. Studies suggest that precipitation effectiveness (PE) within the Thornthwaite moisture index is overestimated in the summer and underestimated in the winter. This index can be effectively used to determine the number of <a href="/wiki/Herbivore" title="Herbivore">herbivore</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammal</a> species numbers within a given area. The index is also used in studies of climate change.</p><p>Thermal classifications within the Thornthwaite scheme include microthermal, mesothermal, and megathermal regimes. A microthermal climate is one of low annual mean temperatures, generally between 0&#xA0;&#xB0;C (32&#xA0;&#xB0;F) and 14&#xA0;&#xB0;C (57&#xA0;&#xB0;F) which experiences short summers and has a potential evaporation between 14 centimetres (5.5&#xA0;in) and 43 centimetres (17&#xA0;in). A mesothermal climate lacks persistent heat or persistent cold, with potential evaporation between 57 centimetres (22&#xA0;in) and 114 centimetres (45&#xA0;in). A megathermal climate is one with persistent high temperatures and abundant rainfall, with potential annual evaporation in excess of 114 centimetres (45&#xA0;in).</p><p>Details of the modern climate record are known through the taking of measurements from such weather instruments as <a href="/wiki/Thermometer" title="Thermometer">thermometers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Barometer" title="Barometer">barometers</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Anemometer" title="Anemometer">anemometers</a> during the past few centuries. The instruments used to study weather over the modern time scale, their known error, their immediate environment, and their exposure have changed over the years, which must be considered when studying the climate of centuries past.</p><p>Paleoclimatology is the study of past climate over a great period of the <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>&apos;s history. It uses evidence from ice sheets, tree rings, sediments, coral, and rocks to determine the past state of the climate. It demonstrates periods of stability and periods of change and can indicate whether changes follow patterns such as regular cycles.</p><p>Climate change is the variation in global or regional climates over time. It reflects changes in the variability or average state of the atmosphere over time scales ranging from decades to millions of years. These changes can be caused by processes internal to the Earth, external forces (e.g. variations in sunlight intensity) or, more recently, human activities.</p><p>In recent usage, especially in the context of <a href="/wiki/Environmental_policy" title="Environmental policy">environmental policy</a>, the term &quot;climate change&quot; often refers only to changes in modern climate, including the rise in average surface <a href="/wiki/Temperature" title="Temperature">temperature</a> known as <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a>. In some cases, the term is also used with a presumption of human causation, as in the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> <a href="/wiki/UNFCCC" class="mw-redirect" title="UNFCCC">Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> (UNFCCC). The UNFCCC uses &quot;climate variability&quot; for non-human caused variations.</p><p>Earth has undergone periodic climate shifts in the past, including four major <a href="/wiki/Ice_age" title="Ice age">ice ages</a>.

The accumulation of snow and ice during a glacial period increases the surface <a href="/wiki/Albedo" title="Albedo">albedo</a>, reflecting more of the Sun&apos;s energy into space and maintaining a lower atmospheric temperature. Increases in <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gases</a>, such as by volcanic activity, can increase the global temperature and produce an interglacial period. Suggested causes of ice age periods include the positions of the <a href="/wiki/Continent" title="Continent">continents</a>, variations in the Earth&apos;s orbit, changes in the solar output, and volcanism.</p><p>Climate models use quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the <a href="/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere" class="mw-redirect" title="Earth&apos;s atmosphere">atmosphere</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ocean" title="Ocean">oceans</a>, land surface and ice. They are used for a variety of purposes; from the study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system, to projections of future climate. All climate models balance, or very nearly balance, incoming energy as short wave (including visible) electromagnetic radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave (infrared) electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth.</p><p>The most talked-about applications of these models in recent years have been their use to infer the consequences of increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> (see <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gas</a>).
