<p>Music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an <a href="/wiki/Entertainment" title="Entertainment">entertainment</a> product for the marketplace. When music was only available through sheet music scores, such as during the Classical and Romantic eras, music lovers would buy the <a href="/wiki/Sheet_music" title="Sheet music">sheet music</a> of their favourite pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home on the piano. With the advent of sound recording, records of popular songs, rather than sheet music became the dominant way that music lovers would enjoy their favourite songs. With the advent of home tape recorders in the 1980s and digital music in the 1990s, music lovers could make tapes or playlists of their favourite songs and take them with them on a <a href="/wiki/Cassette_player" class="mw-redirect" title="Cassette player">portable cassette player</a> or <a href="/wiki/MP3_player" title="MP3 player">MP3 player</a>. Some music lovers create <a href="/wiki/Mix_tape" class="mw-redirect" title="Mix tape">mix tapes</a> of their favorite songs, which serve as a &quot;self-portrait, a gesture of friendship, prescription for an ideal party... [and] an environment consisting solely of what is most ardently loved.&quot;</p>
<p>Amateur musicians compose and/or perform music for their own pleasure, and derive their income elsewhere. Professional musicians are employed by a range of institutions and organisations, including armed forces (in <a href="/wiki/Marching_band" title="Marching band">marching bands</a>, <a href="/wiki/Concert_band" title="Concert band">concert bands</a> and popular music groups), churches and synagogues, symphony <a href="/wiki/Orchestra" title="Orchestra">orchestras</a>, <a href="/wiki/Broadcasting" title="Broadcasting">broadcasting</a> or <a href="/wiki/Filmmaking" title="Filmmaking">film production</a> companies, and <a href="/wiki/Music_school" title="Music school">music schools</a>.

<p>A distinction is often made between music performed for a live audience and music that is performed in a studio so that it can be recorded and distributed through the music retail system or the broadcasting system. However, there are also many cases where a live performance in front of an audience is also recorded and distributed.

<p>&quot;Composition&quot; is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music. In many cultures, including Western <a href="/wiki/Classical_music" title="Classical music">classical music</a>, the act of composing also includes the creation of <a href="/wiki/Music_notation" class="mw-redirect" title="Music notation">music notation</a>, such as a <a href="/wiki/Sheet_music" title="Sheet music">sheet music &quot;score&quot;</a>, which is then performed by the composer or other singers or musicians. In popular music and traditional music, the act of composing, which is typically called <a href="/wiki/Songwriter" title="Songwriter">songwriting</a>, may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the <a href="/wiki/Lead_sheet" title="Lead sheet">lead sheet</a>, which sets out the <a href="/wiki/Melody" title="Melody">melody</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lyrics" title="Lyrics">lyrics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chord_progression" title="Chord progression">chord progression</a>. In classical music, the composer typically <a href="/wiki/Orchestration" title="Orchestration">orchestrates</a> her own compositions, but in <a href="/wiki/Musical_theatre" title="Musical theatre">musical theatre</a> and in <a href="/wiki/Pop_music" title="Pop music">pop music</a>, songwriters may hire an <a href="/wiki/Arranger" class="mw-redirect" title="Arranger">arranger</a> to do the orchestration. In some cases, a songwriter may not use notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music.</p>
<p>Even when music is notated relatively precisely, as in classical music, there are many decisions that a performer has to make, because notation does not specify all of the elements of music precisely. The process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed &quot;interpretation&quot;. Different performers&apos; interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely, in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or <a href="/wiki/Musical_phrasing" class="mw-redirect" title="Musical phrasing">phrasing</a> of the melodies. Composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting their songs, just as much as those who perform the music of others. The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as <a href="/wiki/Historically_informed_performance" title="Historically informed performance">performance practice</a>, whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer.</p>
<p>Although a musical composition often uses <a href="/wiki/Musical_notation" title="Musical notation">musical notation</a> and has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in <a href="/wiki/Popular_music" title="Popular music">popular music</a> when a band collaborates to write a song, or in <a href="/wiki/Musical_theatre" title="Musical theatre">musical theatre</a>, when one person writes the melodies, a second person writes the lyrics, and a third person orchestrates the songs. A piece of music can also be composed with words, images, or computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples range from avant-garde music that uses <a href="/wiki/Graphic_notation" title="Graphic notation">graphic notation</a>, to text compositions such as <i><a href="/wiki/Aus_den_sieben_Tagen" title="Aus den sieben Tagen">Aus den sieben Tagen</a></i>, to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called <a href="/wiki/Aleatoric_music" title="Aleatoric music">aleatoric music</a>, and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as <a href="/wiki/John_Cage" title="John Cage">John Cage</a>, <a href="/wiki/Morton_Feldman" title="Morton Feldman">Morton Feldman</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Witold_Lutos%C5%82awski" title="Witold Lutos&#x142;awski">Witold Lutos&#x142;awski</a>. A more commonly known example of chance-based music is the sound of <a href="/wiki/Wind_chimes" class="mw-redirect" title="Wind chimes">wind chimes</a> jingling in a breeze.</p>
<p>The study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western <a href="/wiki/Classical_music" title="Classical music">classical music</a>, but the definition of composition is broad enough the creation of <a href="/wiki/Popular_music" title="Popular music">popular music</a> and <a href="/wiki/Traditional_music" class="mw-redirect" title="Traditional music">traditional music</a> songs and instrumental pieces and to include spontaneously <a href="/wiki/Music_improvisation" class="mw-redirect" title="Music improvisation">improvised</a> works like those of <a href="/wiki/Free_jazz" title="Free jazz">free jazz</a> performers and African percussionists such as <a href="/wiki/Ewe_drumming" title="Ewe drumming">Ewe drummers</a>.</p>

<p>In the 2000s, music notation typically means the written expression of music notes and rhythms on paper using symbols. When music is written down, the pitches and rhythm of the music, such as the notes of a <a href="/wiki/Melody" title="Melody">melody</a>, are notated. Music notation also often provides instructions on how to perform the music. For example, the sheet music for a song may state that the song is a &quot;slow blues&quot; or a &quot;fast swing&quot;, which indicates the tempo and the genre. To read music notation, a person must have an understanding of <a href="/wiki/Music_theory" title="Music theory">music theory</a>, <a href="/wiki/Harmony" title="Harmony">harmony</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Performance_practice" class="mw-redirect" title="Performance practice">performance practice</a> associated with a particular song or piece&apos;s genre.</p>
<p>Written notation varies with style and period of music. In the 2000s, notated music is produced as <a href="/wiki/Sheet_music" title="Sheet music">sheet music</a> or, for individuals with computer <a href="/wiki/Scorewriter" title="Scorewriter">scorewriter</a> programs, as an image on a <a href="/wiki/Computer_screen" class="mw-redirect" title="Computer screen">computer screen</a>. In ancient times, music notation was put onto stone or clay tablets. To perform music from notation, a singer or instrumentalist requires an understanding of the rhythmic and pitch elements embodied in the symbols and the performance practice that is associated with a piece of music or a genre. In genres requiring <a href="/wiki/Musical_improvisation" title="Musical improvisation">musical improvisation</a>, the performer often plays from music where only the <a href="/wiki/Chord_progression" title="Chord progression">chord changes</a> and form of the song are written, requiring the performer to have a great understanding of the music&apos;s structure, harmony and the styles of a particular genre (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Jazz" title="Jazz">jazz</a> or <a href="/wiki/Country_music" title="Country music">country music</a>).</p>
<p>In Western art music, the most common types of written notation are scores, which include all the music parts of an ensemble piece, and parts, which are the music notation for the individual performers or singers. In popular music, jazz, and blues, the standard musical notation is the <a href="/wiki/Lead_sheet" title="Lead sheet">lead sheet</a>, which notates the melody, chords, <a href="/wiki/Lyrics" title="Lyrics">lyrics</a> (if it is a vocal piece), and structure of the music. <a href="/wiki/Fake_book" title="Fake book">Fake books</a> are also used in jazz; they may consist of lead sheets or simply chord charts, which permit <a href="/wiki/Rhythm_section" title="Rhythm section">rhythm section</a> members to improvise an <a href="/wiki/Accompaniment" title="Accompaniment">accompaniment</a> part to jazz songs. Scores and parts are also used in popular music and jazz, particularly in large ensembles such as jazz &quot;<a href="/wiki/Big_band" title="Big band">big bands</a>.&quot; In popular music, <a href="/wiki/Guitar" title="Guitar">guitarists</a> and electric <a href="/wiki/Bass_guitar" title="Bass guitar">bass</a> players often read music notated in <a href="/wiki/Tablature" title="Tablature">tablature</a> (often abbreviated as &quot;tab&quot;), which indicates the location of the notes to be played on the instrument using a diagram of the guitar or bass fingerboard. Tabulature was also used in the Baroque era to notate music for the <a href="/wiki/Lute" title="Lute">lute</a>, a stringed, fretted instrument.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Improvisation">Improvisation</span></h3>

<p><a href="/wiki/Musical_improvisation" title="Musical improvisation">Musical improvisation</a> is the creation of spontaneous music, often within (or based on) a pre-existing harmonic framework or chord progression. Improvisation is the act of instantaneous composition by performers, where compositional techniques are employed with or without preparation. Improvisation is a major part of some types of music, such as <a href="/wiki/Blues" title="Blues">blues</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jazz" title="Jazz">jazz</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Jazz_fusion" title="Jazz fusion">jazz fusion</a>, in which instrumental performers improvise solos, melody lines and accompaniment parts. In the Western art music tradition, improvisation was an important skill during the Baroque era and during the Classical era. In the Baroque era, performers improvised ornaments and <a href="/wiki/Basso_continuo" class="mw-redirect" title="Basso continuo">basso continuo</a> keyboard players improvised <a href="/wiki/Chord_voicing" class="mw-redirect" title="Chord voicing">chord voicings</a> based on <a href="/wiki/Figured_bass" title="Figured bass">figured bass</a> notation. In the Classical era, solo performers and singers improvised virtuoso <a href="/wiki/Cadenza" title="Cadenza">cadenzas</a> during concerts. However, in the 20th and early 21st century, as &quot;common practice&quot; western <a href="/wiki/Art_music" title="Art music">art music</a> performance became institutionalized in symphony orchestras, opera houses and ballets, improvisation has played a smaller role. At the same time, some modern <a href="/wiki/Composers" class="mw-redirect" title="Composers">composers</a> have increasingly included improvisation in their creative work. In <a href="/wiki/Indian_classical_music" title="Indian classical music">Indian classical music</a>, improvisation is a core component and an essential criterion of performances.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Theory">Theory</span></h3>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Elements_of_music">Elements of music</span></h2>

<p>Music has many different fundamentals or elements. Depending on the definition of &quot;element&quot; being used, these can include: pitch, beat or pulse, tempo, rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, style, allocation of voices, timbre or color, dynamics, expression, articulation, form and structure. The elements of music feature prominently in the music curriculums of Australia, UK and USA. All three curriculums identify pitch, dynamics, timbre and texture as elements, but the other identified elements of music are far from universally agreed. Below is a list of the three official versions of the &quot;elements of music&quot;:</p>

<p>In relation to the UK curriculum, in 2013 the term: &quot;appropriate <a href="/wiki/Musical_notation" title="Musical notation">musical notations</a>&quot; was added to their list of elements and the title of the list was changed from the &quot;elements of music&quot; to the &quot;inter-related dimensions of music&quot;. The inter-related dimensions of music are listed as: pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture, structure and appropriate musical notations.</p>
<p>The phrase &quot;the elements of music&quot; is used in a number of different contexts. The two most common contexts can be differentiated by describing them as the &quot;rudimentary elements of music&quot; and the &quot;perceptual elements of music&quot;.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rudimentary_elements_of_music">Rudimentary elements of music</span></h3>
<p>In the 1800s, the phrase &quot;the elements of music&quot; and the phrase &quot;the rudiments of music&quot; were used interchangeably. The elements described in these documents refer to aspects of music that are needed in order to become a musician, Recent writers such as Estrella  seem to be using the phrase &quot;elements of music&quot; in a similar manner. A definition which most accurately reflects this usage is: &quot;the rudimentary principles of an art, science, etc.: the elements of grammar.&quot; The UK&apos;s curriculum switch to the &quot;inter-related dimensions of music&quot; seems to be a move back to using the rudimentary elements of music.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Perceptual_elements_of_music">Perceptual elements of music</span></h3>
<p>Since the emergence of the study of <a href="/wiki/Psychoacoustics" title="Psychoacoustics">psychoacoustics</a> in the 1930s, most lists of elements of music have related more to how we <i>hear</i> music than how we learn to play it or study it. C.E. Seashore, in his book <i>Psychology of Music</i>, identified four &quot;psychological attributes of sound&quot;. These were: &quot;pitch, loudness, time, and timbre&quot; (p.&#xA0;3). He did not call them the &quot;elements of music&quot; but referred to them as &quot;elemental components&quot; (p.&#xA0;2). Nonetheless these elemental components link precisely with four of the most common musical elements: &quot;Pitch&quot; and &quot;timbre&quot; match exactly, &quot;loudness&quot; links with dynamics and &quot;time&quot; links with the time-based elements of rhythm, duration and tempo. This usage of the phrase &quot;the elements of music&quot; links more closely with <i>Webster&apos;s New 20th Century Dictionary</i> definition of an element as: &quot;a substance which cannot be divided into a simpler form by known methods&quot; and educational institutions&apos; lists of elements align with this list as well.</p>
<p>Writers of lists of &quot;rudimentary elements of music&quot; vary their lists depending on their personal priorities. However, in relation to the perceptual elements of music, it should be possible to identify a list of discrete elements which can be independently manipulated to achieve an intended musical effect. It seems at this stage that there is still research to be done in this area.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Pitch_and_melody">Pitch and melody</span></h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/Pitch_(music)" title="Pitch (music)">Pitch</a> is an aspect of a sound that we can hear, reflecting whether one musical sound, note or tone is &quot;higher&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; than another musical sound, note or tone. We can talk about the highness or lowness of pitch in the more general sense, such as the way a listener hears a piercingly high <a href="/wiki/Piccolo" title="Piccolo">piccolo</a> note as higher in pitch than a deep thump of a <a href="/wiki/Bass_drum" title="Bass drum">bass drum</a>.

<p>A <a href="/wiki/Melody" title="Melody">melody</a> (also called a &quot;tune&quot;) is a series of pitches (notes) sounding in succession (one after the other), often in a rising and falling pattern. The notes of a melody are typically created using pitch systems such as <a href="/wiki/Musical_scale" class="mw-redirect" title="Musical scale">scales</a> or <a href="/wiki/Musical_mode" class="mw-redirect" title="Musical mode">modes</a>. Melodies also often contain notes from the chords used in the song. The melodies in simple folk songs and traditional songs may use only the notes of a single scale, the scale associated with the tonic note or <a href="/wiki/Key_(music)" title="Key (music)">key</a> of a given song. For example, a folk song in the key of C (also referred to as C major) may have a melody that uses only the notes of the C major scale (the individual notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B and C; these are the &quot;<a href="/wiki/White_notes" class="mw-redirect" title="White notes">white notes</a>&quot; on a piano keyboard.

When musicians play three or more different <a href="/wiki/Musical_note" title="Musical note">notes</a> at the same time, this creates a <a href="/wiki/Chord_(music)" title="Chord (music)">chord</a>.

The most commonly used chords are the <a href="/wiki/Major_chord" title="Major chord">major chord</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Minor_chord" title="Minor chord">minor chord</a>. An example of a major chord is the three pitches C, E and G. An example of a minor chord is the three pitches A, C and E. (Pictured is a <a href="/wiki/Guitar_player" class="mw-redirect" title="Guitar player">guitar player</a> performing a chord on a guitar).</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><a href="/wiki/Harmony" title="Harmony">Harmony</a> refers to the &quot;vertical&quot; sounds of pitches in music, which means pitches that played or sung together at the same time to create a <a href="/wiki/Chord_(music)" title="Chord (music)">chord</a>. Usually this means the notes are played at the same time, although harmony may also be implied by a melody that outlines a harmonic structure (i.e., by using melody notes that are played one after the other, outlining the notes of a chord). In music written using the system of major-minor <a href="/wiki/Tonality" title="Tonality">tonality</a> (&quot;keys&quot;), which includes most <a href="/wiki/Classical_music" title="Classical music">classical music</a> written from 1600 to 1900 and most Western pop, rock and traditional music, the key of a piece determines the scale used, which centres around the &quot;home note&quot; or <a href="/wiki/Tonic_(music)" title="Tonic (music)">tonic</a> of the key. Simple classical pieces and many pop and traditional music <a href="/wiki/Song" title="Song">songs</a> are written so that all the music is in a single key. More complex Classical, pop and traditional music songs and pieces may have two keys (and in some cases three or more keys). Classical music from the Romantic era (written from about 1820&#x2013;1900) often contains multiple keys, as does <a href="/wiki/Jazz" title="Jazz">jazz</a>, especially <a href="/wiki/Bebop" title="Bebop">Bebop</a> jazz from the 1940s, in which the key or &quot;home note&quot; of a song may change every four bars or even every two bars.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Rhythm">Rhythm</span></h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/Rhythm" title="Rhythm">Rhythm</a> is the arrangement of sounds and silences in <a href="/wiki/Time" title="Time">time</a>. <a href="/wiki/Metre_(music)" title="Metre (music)">Meter</a> animates time in regular pulse groupings, called <a href="/wiki/Bar_(music)" title="Bar (music)">measures or bars</a>, which in Western classical, popular and traditional music often group notes in sets of two (e.g., 2/4 time), three (e.g., 3/4 time, also known as <a href="/wiki/Waltz" title="Waltz">Waltz</a> time, or 3/8 time), or four (e.g., 4/4 time). Meters are made easier to hear because songs and pieces often (but not always) place an emphasis on the first beat of each grouping. Notable exceptions exist, such as the <a href="/wiki/Backbeat" class="mw-redirect" title="Backbeat">backbeat</a> used in much Western pop and rock, in which a song that uses a measure that consists of four beats (called 4/4 time or <a href="/wiki/Common_time" class="mw-redirect" title="Common time">common time</a>) will have accents on beats two and four, which are typically performed by the drummer on the <a href="/wiki/Snare_drum" title="Snare drum">snare drum</a>, a loud and distinctive-sounding <a href="/wiki/Percussion_instrument" title="Percussion instrument">percussion instrument</a>.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Texture">Texture</span></h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/Musical_texture" class="mw-redirect" title="Musical texture">Musical texture</a> is the overall sound of a piece of music or song. The texture of a piece or sing is determined by how the melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic materials are combined in a composition, thus determining the overall nature of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and range, or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices (see common types below). For example, a thick texture contains many &apos;layers&apos; of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass. The thickness also is affected by the amount and the richness of the instruments. Texture is commonly described according to the number of and relationship between <a href="/wiki/Part_(music)" title="Part (music)">parts</a> or lines of music:</p>

<p>Music that contains a large number of independent <a href="/wiki/Part_(music)" title="Part (music)">parts</a> (e.g., a double <a href="/wiki/Concerto" title="Concerto">concerto</a> accompanied by 100 orchestral instruments with many interweaving melodic lines) is generally said to have a &quot;thicker&quot; or &quot;denser&quot; texture than a work with few parts (e.g., a solo <a href="/wiki/Flute" title="Flute">flute</a> melody accompanied by a single <a href="/wiki/Cello" title="Cello">cello</a>).</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Timbre_or_.22tone_color.22">Timbre or &quot;tone color&quot;</span></h4>
<p>Timbre, sometimes called &quot;color&quot; or &quot;tone color&quot; is the quality or sound of a voice or instrument. Timbre is what makes a particular musical sound different from another, even when they have the same pitch and loudness. For example, a 440&#xA0;Hz A note sounds different when it is played on <a href="/wiki/Oboe" title="Oboe">oboe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Piano" title="Piano">piano</a>, <a href="/wiki/Violin" title="Violin">violin</a> or <a href="/wiki/Electric_guitar" title="Electric guitar">electric guitar</a>. Even if different players of the same instrument play the same note, their notes might sound different due to differences in instrumental technique (e.g., different <a href="/wiki/Embouchure" title="Embouchure">embouchures</a>), different types of accessories (e.g., mouthpieces for brass players, reeds for oboe and bassoon players) or strings made out of different materials for string players (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Gut_string" class="mw-redirect" title="Gut string">gut strings</a> versus <a href="/wiki/Steel_strings" class="mw-redirect" title="Steel strings">steel strings</a>). Even two instrumentalists playing the same note on the same instrument (one after the other) may sound different due to different ways of playing the instrument (e.g., two string players might hold the bow differently).</p>
<p>The physical characteristics of sound that determine the perception of timbre include the <a href="/wiki/Spectrum" title="Spectrum">spectrum</a>, <a href="/wiki/Envelope_(waves)" title="Envelope (waves)">envelope</a> and <a href="/wiki/Overtone" title="Overtone">overtones</a> of a note or musical sound.

<p>In music, <a href="/wiki/Musical_form" title="Musical form">form</a> describes how the overall structure or plan of a <a href="/wiki/Song" title="Song">song</a> or piece of music, and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections. In the early 20th century, <a href="/wiki/Tin_Pan_Alley" title="Tin Pan Alley">Tin Pan Alley</a> songs and <a href="/wiki/Musical_theatre" title="Musical theatre">Broadway musical</a> songs were often in <a href="/wiki/AABA_form" class="mw-redirect" title="AABA form">AABA</a> <a href="/wiki/32_bar_form" class="mw-redirect" title="32 bar form">32 bar form</a>, in which the A sections repeated the same eight bar melody and the B section provided a contrasting melody and/or harmony for 8 bars. From the 1960s onward, Western pop and rock songs are often in <a href="/wiki/Verse-chorus_form" class="mw-redirect" title="Verse-chorus form">verse-chorus form</a>, which is based around a sequence of <a href="/wiki/Verse_(popular_music)" class="mw-redirect" title="Verse (popular music)">verse</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chorus_(song)" class="mw-redirect" title="Chorus (song)">chorus</a> (&quot;refrain&quot;) sections, with new <a href="/wiki/Lyrics" title="Lyrics">lyrics</a> for most verses and repeating lyrics for the choruses. Popular music often makes use of <a href="/wiki/Strophic_form" title="Strophic form">strophic form</a>, sometimes in conjunction with the <a href="/wiki/Twelve_bar_blues" class="mw-redirect" title="Twelve bar blues">twelve bar blues</a>.</p>
<p>In the tenth edition of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Oxford_Companion_to_Music" title="The Oxford Companion to Music">The Oxford Companion to Music</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Percy_Scholes" title="Percy Scholes">Percy Scholes</a> defines musical form as &quot;a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration.&quot; Examples of common forms of Western music include the <a href="/wiki/Fugue" title="Fugue">fugue</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Invention_(musical_composition)" title="Invention (musical composition)">invention</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sonata_form" title="Sonata form">sonata-allegro</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canon_(music)" title="Canon (music)">canon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Strophic" class="mw-redirect" title="Strophic">strophic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Theme_and_variations" class="mw-redirect" title="Theme and variations">theme and variations</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Rondo" title="Rondo">rondo</a>. Scholes states that European classical music had only six stand-alone forms: simple binary, simple ternary, compound binary, rondo, air with variations, and <a href="/wiki/Fugue" title="Fugue">fugue</a> (although musicologist <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Mann_(musicologist)" title="Alfred Mann (musicologist)">Alfred Mann</a> emphasized that the fugue is primarily a method of composition that has sometimes taken on certain structural conventions.)</p>
<p>Where a piece cannot readily be broken down into sectional units (though it might borrow some form from a poem, story or <a href="/wiki/Programme_music" class="mw-redirect" title="Programme music">programme</a>), it is said to be <a href="/wiki/Through-composed" title="Through-composed">through-composed</a>. Such is often the case with a <a href="/wiki/Fantasia_(music)" title="Fantasia (music)">fantasia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Prelude_(music)" title="Prelude (music)">prelude</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rhapsody_(music)" title="Rhapsody (music)">rhapsody</a>, <a href="/wiki/Etude" class="mw-redirect" title="Etude">etude</a> (or study), <a href="/wiki/Symphonic_poem" title="Symphonic poem">symphonic poem</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bagatelle_(music)" title="Bagatelle (music)">Bagatelle</a>, <a href="/wiki/Impromptu" title="Impromptu">impromptu</a>, etc. Professor Charles Keil classified forms and formal detail as &quot;sectional, developmental, or variational.&quot;</p>
<dl>
<dt>Sectional form</dt>
</dl>
<p>This form is built from a sequence of clear-cut units that may be referred to by letters but also often have generic names such as <a href="/wiki/Introduction_(music)" title="Introduction (music)">introduction</a> and <a href="/wiki/Coda_(music)" title="Coda (music)">coda</a>, exposition, development and <a href="/wiki/Recapitulation_(music)" title="Recapitulation (music)">recapitulation</a>, verse, chorus or <a href="/wiki/Refrain" title="Refrain">refrain</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Bridge_(music)" title="Bridge (music)">bridge</a>. Introductions and codas, when they are no more than that, are frequently excluded from formal analysis. All such units may typically be eight measures long. Sectional forms include:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Strophic form</dt>

<p>This form is defined by its &quot;unrelieved repetition&quot; (<b>AAAA</b>...).</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Medley_(music)" class="mw-redirect" title="Medley (music)">Medley</a>, <a href="/wiki/Potpourri_(music)" title="Potpourri (music)">potpourri</a> is the extreme opposite, that of &quot;unrelieved variation&quot;: it is simply an indefinite sequence of self-contained sections (<b>ABCD</b>...), sometimes with repeats (<b>AABBCCDD</b>...).

Binary form in major and minor keys. Each section must be at least three phrases long.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This form uses two sections (<b>AB</b>...), each often repeated (<b>AABB</b>...). In 18th-century western classical music, &quot;simple binary&quot; form was often used for dances and carried with it the convention that the two sections should be in different <a href="/wiki/Musical_key" class="mw-redirect" title="Musical key">musical keys</a> but same rhythm, duration and tone. The alternation of two tunes gives enough variety to permit a dance to be extended for as long as desired.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Ternary form</dt>
</dl>

<p>This form has three parts. In Western classical music a simple ternary form has a third section that is a recapitulation of the first (<b>ABA</b>). Often, the first section is repeated (<b>AABA</b>). This approach was popular in the 18th-century operatic <a href="/wiki/Aria" title="Aria">aria</a>, and was called <i><a href="/wiki/Da_capo" title="Da capo">da capo</a></i> (i.e. &quot;repeat from the top&quot;) form. Later, it gave rise to the <a href="/wiki/Thirty-two-bar_form" title="Thirty-two-bar form">32-bar song</a>, with the <b>B</b> section then often referred to as the &quot;middle eight&quot;. A song has more need than a dance of a self-contained form with a beginning and an end of course.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Rondo form</dt>
</dl>

<p>This form has a recurring theme alternating with different (usually contrasting) sections called &quot;episodes&quot;. It may be asymmetrical (<b>ABACADAEA</b>) or symmetrical (<b>ABACABA</b>). A recurring section, especially the main theme, is sometimes more thoroughly varied, or else one episode may be a &quot;development&quot; of it. A similar arrangement is the <a href="/wiki/Ritornello" title="Ritornello">ritornello</a> form of the Baroque <a href="/wiki/Concerto_grosso" title="Concerto grosso">concerto grosso</a>. <a href="/wiki/Arch_form" title="Arch form">Arch form</a> (<b>ABCBA</b>) resembles a symmetrical rondo without intermediate repetitions of the main theme. It is normally used in a round.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Variational form</dt>
</dl>

<p>Variational forms are those in which variation is an important formative element.</p>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/Theme_and_Variations" class="mw-redirect" title="Theme and Variations">Theme and Variations</a>:</b> a <a href="/wiki/Theme_(music)" class="mw-redirect" title="Theme (music)">theme</a>, which in itself can be of any shorter form (binary, ternary, etc.), forms the only &quot;section&quot; and is repeated indefinitely (as in strophic form) but is varied each time (A,B,A,F,Z,A), so as to make a sort of sectional chain form. An important variant of this, much used in 17th-century British music and in the <a href="/wiki/Passacaglia" title="Passacaglia">Passacaglia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chaconne" title="Chaconne">Chaconne</a>, was that of the <a href="/wiki/Ground_bass" class="mw-redirect" title="Ground bass">ground bass</a> - a repeating bass theme or <i>basso <a href="/wiki/Ostinato" title="Ostinato">ostinato</a></i> over and around which the rest of the structure unfolds, often, but not always, spinning <a href="/wiki/Polyphony" title="Polyphony">polyphonic</a> or <a href="/wiki/Counterpoint" title="Counterpoint">contrapuntal</a> threads, or improvising <a href="/wiki/Division_(music)" title="Division (music)">divisions</a> and <a href="/wiki/Descant" title="Descant">descants</a>. This is said by Scholes (1977) to be the form <i>par excellence</i> of unaccompanied or accompanied solo instrumental music. The <a href="/wiki/Rondo" title="Rondo">Rondo</a> is often found with sections varied (<b>AABACABA</b>) or (<b>ABACABA</b>).</p>

<dt>Developmental form</dt>
</dl>

<p>Developmental forms are built directly from smaller units, such as <a href="/wiki/Motif_(music)" title="Motif (music)">motifs</a>. A well-known Classical piece with a motif is <a href="/wiki/Beethoven%27s_fifth_symphony" class="mw-redirect" title="Beethoven&apos;s fifth symphony">Beethoven&apos;s fifth symphony</a>, which starts with three short repeated notes and then a long note. In Classical pieces that are based on motifs, the motif is usually combined, varied and worked out in different ways, perhaps having a symmetrical or arch-like underpinning and a progressive development from beginning to end. By far the most important developmental form in Western classical music is <a href="/wiki/Sonata_form" title="Sonata form">Sonata form</a>. This form, also known as <i>sonata</i> form, first movement form, compound binary, ternary and a variety of other names, developed from the binary-formed dance movement described above but is almost always cast in a greater ternary form having the nominal subdivisions of <i>Exposition, Development</i> and <i>Recapitulation</i>. Usually, but not always, the &quot;A&quot; parts (<a href="/wiki/Exposition_(music)" title="Exposition (music)">Exposition</a> and <a href="/wiki/Recapitulation_(music)" title="Recapitulation (music)">Recapitulation</a>, respectively) may be subdivided into two or three <a href="/wiki/Theme_(music)" class="mw-redirect" title="Theme (music)">themes</a> or theme groups which are taken asunder and recombined to form the &quot;B&quot; part (the <a href="/wiki/Musical_development" title="Musical development">development</a>) - thus e. g. (AabB[dev. of a and/or b]Aab+coda). This developmental form is generally confined to certain sections of the piece, as to the middle section of the first movement of a sonata, though nineteenth-century composers such as Berlioz, Liszt and Wagner made valiant efforts to derive large-scale works purely or mainly from the motif.</p>

<dd>&quot;While Genesis 4.21 identifies Jubal as the &quot;father of all such as handle the harp and pipe,&quot; the Pentateuch is nearly silent about the practice and instruction of music in the early life of Israel. Then, in I Samuel 10 and the texts that follow, a curious thing happens. &quot;One finds in the biblical text,&quot; writes Alfred Sendrey, &quot;a sudden and unexplained upsurge of large choirs and orchestras, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation.&quot; This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet Samuel was the patriarch of a school, which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians. This public music school, perhaps the earliest in recorded history, was not restricted to a priestly class&#x2014;which is how the shepherd boy David appears on the scene as a minstrel to King Saul.&quot;</dd>

<p><a href="/wiki/Renaissance_music" title="Renaissance music">Renaissance music</a> (c. 1400 to 1600) was more focused on secular (non-religious) themes, such as <a href="/wiki/Courtly_love" title="Courtly love">courtly love</a>. Around 1450, the <a href="/wiki/Printing_press" title="Printing press">printing press</a> was invented, which made printed <a href="/wiki/Sheet_music" title="Sheet music">sheet music</a> much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the printing press, all notated music was hand-copied). The increased availability of sheet music helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. Musicians and singers often worked for the church, courts and towns. Church choirs grew in size, and the church remained an important patron of music. By the middle of the 15th century, <a href="/wiki/Composer" title="Composer">composers</a> wrote richly polyphonic sacred music, in which different melody lines were interwoven simultaneously. Prominent composers from this era include <a href="/wiki/Guillaume_Dufay" class="mw-redirect" title="Guillaume Dufay">Guillaume Dufay</a>, <a href="/wiki/Giovanni_Pierluigi_da_Palestrina" title="Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina">Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Morley" title="Thomas Morley">Thomas Morley</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Orlande_de_Lassus" title="Orlande de Lassus">Orlande de Lassus</a>. As musical activity shifted from the church to the aristocratic courts, kings, queens and princes competed for the finest composers.</p>
<p>Many leading important composers came from the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France. They are called the Franco-Flemish composers. They held important positions throughout Europe, especially in Italy. Other countries with vibrant musical activity included Germany, England, and Spain.</p>

German Baroque composers wrote for small <a href="/wiki/Musical_ensemble" title="Musical ensemble">ensembles</a> including <a href="/wiki/String_section" title="String section">strings</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brass_instrument" title="Brass instrument">brass</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Woodwind_instrument" title="Woodwind instrument">woodwinds</a>, as well as <a href="/wiki/Choir" title="Choir">choirs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Organ_(music)" title="Organ (music)">pipe organ</a>, <a href="/wiki/Harpsichord" title="Harpsichord">harpsichord</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Clavichord" title="Clavichord">clavichord</a>.

<p>The music of the <a href="/wiki/Classical_period_(music)" title="Classical period (music)">Classical period</a> (1730 to 1820) aimed to imitate what were seen as the key elements of the art and philosophy of Ancient Greece and Rome: the ideals of balance, proportion and disciplined expression. (Note: the music from the <a href="/wiki/Classical_period_(music)" title="Classical period (music)">Classical period</a> should not be confused with <a href="/wiki/Classical_music" title="Classical music">Classical music</a> in general, a term which refers to Western <a href="/wiki/Art_music" title="Art music">art music</a> from the fifth century to the 2000s, which includes the Classical period as one of a number of periods). Music from the Classical period has a lighter, clearer and considerably simpler texture than the <a href="/wiki/Baroque_music" title="Baroque music">Baroque music</a> which preceded it. The main style was <a href="/wiki/Homophony" title="Homophony">homophony</a>, where a prominent <a href="/wiki/Melody" title="Melody">melody</a> and a subordinate chordal <a href="/wiki/Accompaniment" title="Accompaniment">accompaniment</a> part are clearly distinct. Classical instrumental melodies tended to be almost voicelike and singable. New genres were developed, and the <a href="/wiki/Fortepiano" title="Fortepiano">fortepiano</a>, the forerunner to the modern <a href="/wiki/Piano" title="Piano">piano</a>, replaced the Baroque era <a href="/wiki/Harpsichord" title="Harpsichord">harpsichord</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pipe_organ" title="Pipe organ">pipe organ</a> as the main <a href="/wiki/Keyboard_instrument" title="Keyboard instrument">keyboard instrument</a>.</p>
<p>Importance was given to <a href="/wiki/Instrumental" title="Instrumental">instrumental</a> music. It was dominated by further development of musical forms initially defined in the Baroque period: the <a href="/wiki/Sonata" title="Sonata">sonata</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Concerto" title="Concerto">concerto</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Symphony" title="Symphony">symphony</a>. Others main kinds were the <a href="/wiki/Trio_(music)" title="Trio (music)">trio</a>, <a href="/wiki/String_quartet" title="String quartet">string quartet</a>, <a href="/wiki/Serenade" title="Serenade">serenade</a> and <a href="/wiki/Divertimento" title="Divertimento">divertimento</a>. The sonata was the most important and developed form. Although Baroque composers also wrote sonatas, the Classical style of sonata is completely distinct. All of the main instrumental forms of the Classical era, from string quartets to symphonies and concertos, were based on the structure of the sonata. The instruments used <a href="/wiki/Chamber_music" title="Chamber music">chamber music</a> and <a href="/wiki/Orchestra" title="Orchestra">orchestra</a> became more standardized. In place of the <a href="/wiki/Basso_continuo" class="mw-redirect" title="Basso continuo">basso continuo</a> group of the Baroque era, which consisted of harpsichord, organ or lute along with a number of bass instruments selected at the discretion of the group leader (e.g., viol, cello, theorbo, serpent), Classical chamber groups used specified, standardized instruments (e.g., a <a href="/wiki/String_quartet" title="String quartet">string quartet</a> would be performed by two violins, a viola and a cello). The Baroque era improvised chord-playing of the continuo keyboardist or lute player was gradually phased out between 1750 and 1800.</p>
<p>One of the most important changes made in the Classical period was the development of public concerts. The aristocracy still played a significant role in the sponsorship of concerts and compositions, but it was now possible for composers to survive without being permanent employees of queens or princes. The increasing popularity of classical music led to a growth in the number and types of orchestras. The expansion of orchestral concerts necessitated the building of large public performance spaces. Symphonic music including symphonies, musical accompaniment to <a href="/wiki/Ballet" title="Ballet">ballet</a> and mixed vocal/instrumental genres such as <a href="/wiki/Opera" title="Opera">opera</a> and <a href="/wiki/Oratorio" title="Oratorio">oratorio</a> became more popular.</p>
<p>The best known composers of Classicism are <a href="/wiki/Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach" title="Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach">Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach</a>, <a href="/wiki/Christoph_Willibald_Gluck" title="Christoph Willibald Gluck">Christoph Willibald Gluck</a>, <a href="/wiki/Johann_Christian_Bach" title="Johann Christian Bach">Johann Christian Bach</a>, <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Haydn" title="Joseph Haydn">Joseph Haydn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart" title="Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven" title="Ludwig van Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a> and <a href="/wiki/Franz_Schubert" title="Franz Schubert">Franz Schubert</a>.

<p><a href="/wiki/Romantic_music" title="Romantic music">Romantic music</a> (c. 1810 to 1900) from the nineteenth century had many elements in common with the <a href="/wiki/Romanticism" title="Romanticism">Romantic</a> styles in literature and painting of the era. Romanticism was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature. Romantic music expanded beyond the rigid styles and forms of the Classical era into more passionate, dramatic expressive pieces and songs. Romantic composers such as <a href="/wiki/Wagner" class="mw-redirect" title="Wagner">Wagner</a> and <a href="/wiki/Brahms" class="mw-redirect" title="Brahms">Brahms</a> attempted to increase emotional expression and power in their music to describe deeper truths or human feelings. With symphonic <a href="/wiki/Tone_poem" class="mw-redirect" title="Tone poem">tone poems</a>, composers tried to tell stories and evoke images or landscapes using instrumental music. Some composers promoted <a href="/wiki/Nationalism" title="Nationalism">nationalistic</a> pride with patriotic orchestral music inspired by <a href="/wiki/Folk_music" title="Folk music">folk music</a>. The emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take precedence over tradition.</p>
<p>Romantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy, and went further in the <a href="/wiki/Syncretism" title="Syncretism">syncretism</a> of exploring different art-forms in a musical context, (such as <a href="/wiki/Literature" title="Literature">literature</a>), history (historical figures and legends), or nature itself. <a href="/wiki/Romantic_love" class="mw-redirect" title="Romantic love">Romantic love</a> or longing was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period. In some cases the formal structures from the classical period continued to be used (e.g., the <a href="/wiki/Sonata_form" title="Sonata form">sonata form</a> used in <a href="/wiki/String_quartet" title="String quartet">string quartets</a> and <a href="/wiki/Symphony" title="Symphony">symphonies</a>), but these forms were expanded and altered. In many cases, new approaches were explored for existing genres, forms, and functions. Also, new forms were created that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter. Composers continued to develop <a href="/wiki/Opera" title="Opera">opera</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ballet" title="Ballet">ballet</a> music, exploring new styles and themes.</p>
<p>In the years after 1800, the music developed by <a href="/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven" title="Ludwig van Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a> and <a href="/wiki/Franz_Schubert" title="Franz Schubert">Franz Schubert</a> introduced a more dramatic, expressive style. In Beethoven&apos;s case, short <a href="/wiki/Motif_(music)" title="Motif (music)">motifs</a>, developed organically, came to replace <a href="/wiki/Melody" title="Melody">melody</a> as the most significant compositional unit (an example is the distinctive four note figure used in his <a href="/wiki/Symphony_No._5_(Beethoven)" title="Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)">Fifth Symphony</a>). Later Romantic composers such as <a href="/wiki/Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky" title="Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky">Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky</a>, <a href="/wiki/Anton%C3%ADn_Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k" title="Anton&#xED;n Dvo&#x159;&#xE1;k">Anton&#xED;n Dvo&#x159;&#xE1;k</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Gustav_Mahler" title="Gustav Mahler">Gustav Mahler</a> used more unusual <a href="/wiki/Chord_(music)" title="Chord (music)">chords</a> and more <a href="/wiki/Consonance_and_dissonance" title="Consonance and dissonance">dissonance</a> to create dramatic tension.

<p>In the 19th century, one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of <a href="/wiki/Sheet_music" title="Sheet music">sheet music</a>, which <a href="/wiki/Middle_class" title="Middle class">middle class</a> amateur music lovers would perform at home on their <a href="/wiki/Piano" title="Piano">piano</a> or other common instruments, such as <a href="/wiki/Violin" title="Violin">violin</a>. With <a href="/wiki/20th-century_music" title="20th-century music">20th-century music</a>, the invention of new <a href="/wiki/Music_technology_(electric)" title="Music technology (electric)">electric technologies</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Radio_broadcasting" title="Radio broadcasting">radio broadcasting</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Mass_market" title="Mass market">mass market</a> availability of <a href="/wiki/Gramophone_record" title="Gramophone record">gramophone records</a> meant that <a href="/wiki/Sound_recording" class="mw-redirect" title="Sound recording">sound recordings</a> of songs and pieces heard by listeners (either on the radio or on their record player) became the main way to learn about new songs and pieces. There was a vast increase in music listening as the <a href="/wiki/Radio" title="Radio">radio</a> gained popularity and <a href="/wiki/Phonograph" title="Phonograph">phonographs</a> were used to replay and distribute music, because whereas in the 19th century, the focus on sheet music restricted access to new music to the middle class and <a href="/wiki/Upper_class" title="Upper class">upper class</a> people who could read music and who owned pianos and instruments. In the 20th century, anyone with a radio or record player could hear <a href="/wiki/Opera" title="Opera">operas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Symphony" title="Symphony">symphonies</a> and <a href="/wiki/Big_band" title="Big band">big bands</a> right in their own living room. This allowed lower-income people, who would never be able to afford an opera or symphony concert ticket to hear this music. It also meant that people could hear music from different parts of the country, or even different parts of the world, even if they could not afford to travel to these locations. This helped to spread musical styles.</p>
<p>The focus of <a href="/wiki/Art_music" title="Art music">art music</a> in the 20th century was characterized by exploration of new rhythms, styles, and sounds. The horrors of <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> influenced many of the arts, including music, and some composers began exploring darker, harsher sounds. <a href="/wiki/Traditional_music" class="mw-redirect" title="Traditional music">Traditional music</a> styles such as <a href="/wiki/Jazz" title="Jazz">jazz</a> and <a href="/wiki/Folk_music" title="Folk music">folk music</a> were used by composers as a source of ideas for <a href="/wiki/Classical_music" title="Classical music">classical music</a>. <a href="/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky" title="Igor Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arnold_Schoenberg" title="Arnold Schoenberg">Arnold Schoenberg</a>, and <a href="/wiki/John_Cage" title="John Cage">John Cage</a> were all influential composers in 20th-century art music. The invention of <a href="/wiki/Sound_recording" class="mw-redirect" title="Sound recording">sound recording</a> and the ability to edit music gave rise to new subgenre of classical music, including the <a href="/wiki/Acousmatic" class="mw-redirect" title="Acousmatic">acousmatic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Musique_concr%C3%A8te" title="Musique concr&#xE8;te">Musique concr&#xE8;te</a> schools of electronic composition. Sound recording was also a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be widely distributed. The introduction of the <a href="/wiki/Multitrack_recording" title="Multitrack recording">multitrack recording</a> system had a major influence on <a href="/wiki/Rock_music" title="Rock music">rock music</a>, because it could do much more than record a band&apos;s performance. Using a multitrack system, a band and their <a href="/wiki/Music_producer" class="mw-redirect" title="Music producer">music producer</a> could overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Jazz" title="Jazz">Jazz</a> evolved and became an important genre of music over the course of the 20th century, and during the second half of that century, <a href="/wiki/Rock_music" title="Rock music">rock music</a> did the same.

However, as it gets performed, the interpretation of a song or piece can evolve and change. In classical music, instrumental performers, singers or conductors may gradually make changes to the phrasing or tempo of a piece. In popular and traditional music, the performers have a lot more freedom to make changes to the form of a song or piece. As such, in popular and traditional music styles, even when a band plays a <a href="/wiki/Cover_song" class="mw-redirect" title="Cover song">cover song</a>, they can make changes to it such as adding a <a href="/wiki/Guitar_solo" title="Guitar solo">guitar solo</a> to or inserting an introduction.</p>

A rehearsal is a structured repetition of a song or piece by the performers until it can be sung and/or played correctly and, if it is a song or piece for more than one musician, until the parts are together from a rhythmic and tuning perspective. Improvisation is the creation of a musical idea&#x2013;a melody or other musical line&#x2013;created on the spot, often based on scales or pre-existing melodic <a href="/wiki/Riff" class="mw-redirect" title="Riff">riffs</a>.</p>
<p>Many cultures have strong traditions of <a href="/wiki/Solo_(music)" title="Solo (music)">solo</a> performance (in which one singer or instrumentalist performs), such as in Indian classical music, and in the Western art-music tradition. Other cultures, such as in <a href="/wiki/Bali" title="Bali">Bali</a>, include strong traditions of group performance.

<p>In music, an &quot;ornament&quot; is a decoration to a melody, bassline or other musical part. The detail included explicitly in the <a href="/wiki/Musical_notation" title="Musical notation">music notation</a> varies between genres and historical periods. In general, art music notation from the 17th through the 19th century required performers to have a great deal of contextual knowledge about performing styles. For example, in the 17th and 18th century, music notated for solo performers typically indicated a simple, unadorned melody. However, performers were expected to know how to add stylistically appropriate ornaments to add interest to the music, such as <a href="/wiki/Trill_(music)" title="Trill (music)">trills</a> and <a href="/wiki/Turn_(music)#Turn" class="mw-redirect" title="Turn (music)">turns</a>.</p>
<p>In the 19th century, art music for solo performers may give a general instruction such as to perform the music expressively, without describing in detail how the performer should do this. The performer was expected to know how to use tempo changes, <a href="/wiki/Accent_(music)" title="Accent (music)">accentuation</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Rest_(music)" title="Rest (music)">pauses</a> (among other devices) to obtain this &quot;expressive&quot; performance style. In the 20th century, art music notation often became more explicit and used a range of markings and annotations to indicate to performers how they should play or sing the piece.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Popular_music" title="Popular music">popular music</a> and jazz, music notation almost always indicates only the basic framework of the melody, harmony, or performance approach; musicians and singers are expected to know the performance conventions and styles associated with specific genres and pieces. For example, the &quot;<a href="/wiki/Lead_sheet" title="Lead sheet">lead sheet</a>&quot; for a jazz tune may only indicate the melody and the chord changes. The performers in the <a href="/wiki/Jazz_band" title="Jazz band">jazz ensemble</a> are expected to know how to &quot;flesh out&quot; this basic structure by adding ornaments, improvised music, and chordal accompaniment.</p>

<p>Philosophy of music is a subfield of <a href="/wiki/Philosophy" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>. The philosophy of music is the study of fundamental questions regarding music. The philosophical study of music has many connections with philosophical questions in <a href="/wiki/Metaphysics" title="Metaphysics">metaphysics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aesthetics" title="Aesthetics">aesthetics</a>. Some basic questions in the philosophy of music are:</p>

<p>In ancient times, such as with the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greeks</a>, the aesthetics of music explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the eighteenth century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (<i><a href="/wiki/Plaisir" class="mw-redirect" title="Plaisir">plaisir</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Jouissance" title="Jouissance">jouissance</a></i>) of music. The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Gottlieb_Baumgarten" title="Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten">Baumgarten</a> in the 18th century, followed by <a href="/wiki/Immanuel_Kant" title="Immanuel Kant">Kant</a>. Through their writing, the ancient term &apos;aesthetics&apos;, meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation. In the 2000s, philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music&apos;s capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, important contributions were made by <a href="/wiki/Peter_Kivy" title="Peter Kivy">Peter Kivy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jerrold_Levinson" title="Jerrold Levinson">Jerrold Levinson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Roger_Scruton" title="Roger Scruton">Roger Scruton</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Davies_(philosopher)" title="Stephen Davies (philosopher)">Stephen Davies</a>. However, many musicians, <a href="/wiki/Music_criticism" title="Music criticism">music critics</a>, and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between <a href="/wiki/Eduard_Hanslick" title="Eduard Hanslick">Eduard Hanslick</a>, a music critic and musicologist, and composer <a href="/wiki/Richard_Wagner" title="Richard Wagner">Richard Wagner</a> regarding whether music can express meaning. <a href="/wiki/Harry_Partch" title="Harry Partch">Harry Partch</a> and some other <a href="/wiki/Musicologist" class="mw-redirect" title="Musicologist">musicologists</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Kyle_Gann" title="Kyle Gann">Kyle Gann</a>, have studied and tried to popularize <a href="/wiki/Microtonal_music" title="Microtonal music">microtonal music</a> and the usage of alternate <a href="/wiki/Musical_scale" class="mw-redirect" title="Musical scale">musical scales</a>.

<p>It is often thought that music has the ability to affect our <a href="/wiki/Emotions" class="mw-redirect" title="Emotions">emotions</a>, <a href="/wiki/Intellect" title="Intellect">intellect</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Psychology" title="Psychology">psychology</a>; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The philosopher <a href="/wiki/Plato" title="Plato">Plato</a> suggests in <i>the Republic</i> that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state. (Book VII)</p>
<p>There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include <a href="/wiki/Lyrics" title="Lyrics">lyricism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Harmony" title="Harmony">harmony</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hypnotism" class="mw-redirect" title="Hypnotism">hypnotism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Emotion" title="Emotion">emotiveness</a>, <a href="/wiki/Temporal_Dynamics_of_Music_and_Language" class="mw-redirect" title="Temporal Dynamics of Music and Language">temporal dynamics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Resonance" title="Resonance">resonance</a>, playfulness, and <a href="/wiki/Timbre_(music)" class="mw-redirect" title="Timbre (music)">color</a> (see also <a href="/wiki/Musical_development" title="Musical development">musical development</a>).</p>

<p>Cognitive neuroscience of music is the scientific study of brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying music. These behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and ancillary activities.

<p>Many ethnographic studies demonstrate that music is a participatory, community-based activity. Music is experienced by individuals in a range of social settings ranging from being alone to attending a large concert, forming a <a href="/wiki/Music_community" title="Music community">music community</a>, which cannot be understood as a function of individual will or accident; it includes both commercial and non-commercial participants with a shared set of common values. Musical performances take different forms in different cultures and socioeconomic milieus. In Europe and North America, there is often a divide between what types of music are viewed as a &quot;<a href="/wiki/High_culture" title="High culture">high culture</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="/wiki/Low_culture" title="Low culture">low culture</a>.&quot; &quot;High culture&quot; types of music typically include Western art music such as Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and modern-era symphonies, concertos, and solo works, and are typically heard in formal concerts in concert halls and churches, with the audience sitting quietly in seats.</p>
<p>Other types of music&#x2014;including, but not limited to, jazz, blues, <a href="/wiki/Soul_music" title="Soul music">soul</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Country_music" title="Country music">country</a>&#x2014;are often performed in bars, nightclubs, and theatres, where the audience may be able to drink, dance, and express themselves by cheering. Until the later 20th century, the division between &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; musical forms was widely accepted as a valid distinction that separated out better quality, more advanced &quot;art music&quot; from the popular styles of music heard in bars and dance halls.</p>
<p>However, in the 1980s and 1990s, musicologists studying this perceived divide between &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; musical genres argued that this distinction is not based on the musical value or quality of the different types of music. Rather, they argued that this distinction was based largely on the <a href="/wiki/Socioeconomic" class="mw-redirect" title="Socioeconomic">socioeconomics</a> standing or <a href="/wiki/Social_class" title="Social class">social class</a> of the performers or audience of the different types of music. For example, whereas the audience for Classical symphony concerts typically have above-average incomes, the audience for a rap concert in an inner-city area may have below-average incomes. Even though the performers, audience, or venue where non-&quot;art&quot; music is performed may have a lower socioeconomic status, the music that is performed, such as blues, rap, <a href="/wiki/Punk_rock" title="Punk rock">punk</a>, <a href="/wiki/Funk" title="Funk">funk</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Ska" title="Ska">ska</a> may be very complex and sophisticated.</p>
<p>When composers introduce styles of music that break with convention, there can be a strong resistance from academic music experts and popular culture. Late-period Beethoven string quartets, Stravinsky <a href="/wiki/Ballet" title="Ballet">ballet</a> scores, <a href="/wiki/Serialism" title="Serialism">serialism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bebop" title="Bebop">bebop</a>-era jazz, hip hop, punk rock, and <a href="/wiki/Electronica" title="Electronica">electronica</a> have all been considered non-music by some critics when they were first introduced. Such themes are examined in the <a href="/wiki/Sociology" title="Sociology">sociology</a> of music. The sociological study of music, sometimes called <a href="/wiki/Sociomusicology" title="Sociomusicology">sociomusicology</a>, is often pursued in departments of sociology, media studies, or music, and is closely related to the field of <a href="/wiki/Ethnomusicology" title="Ethnomusicology">ethnomusicology</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Music_technology" title="Music technology">Technology</a> has had an influence on music since prehistoric times, when cave people used simple tools to bore holes into bone flutes 41,000 years ago. Technology continued to influence music throughout the history of music, as it enabled new instruments and music notation reproduction systems to be used, with one of the watershed moments in music notation being the invention of the <a href="/wiki/Printing_press" title="Printing press">printing press</a> in the 1400s, which meant music scores no longer had to be hand copied. In the 19th century, music technology led to the development of a more powerful, louder <a href="/wiki/Piano" title="Piano">piano</a> and led to the development of new valves brass instruments. In the early 20th century (in the late 1920s), as <a href="/wiki/Sound_film" title="Sound film">talking pictures</a> emerged in the early 20th century, with their prerecorded musical tracks, an increasing number of moviehouse orchestra musicians found themselves out of work.

In industrialized countries, listening to music through a recorded form, such as <a href="/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction" title="Sound recording and reproduction">sound recording</a> or watching a <a href="/wiki/Music_video" title="Music video">music video</a>, became more common than experiencing live performance, roughly in the middle of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Sometimes, live performances incorporate prerecorded sounds.

Most karaoke machines also have video screens that show lyrics to songs being performed; performers can follow the lyrics as they sing over the instrumental tracks.</p>

<p>The advent of the <a href="/wiki/Internet" title="Internet">Internet</a> and widespread high-speed broadband access has transformed the experience of music, partly through the increased ease of access to recordings of music via <a href="/wiki/Streaming_video" class="mw-redirect" title="Streaming video">streaming video</a> and vastly increased choice of music for consumers. <a href="/wiki/Chris_Anderson_(writer)" title="Chris Anderson (writer)">Chris Anderson</a>, in his book <i><a href="/wiki/The_Long_Tail:_Why_the_Future_of_Business_Is_Selling_Less_of_More" class="mw-redirect" title="The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More">The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More</a></i>, suggests that while the traditional economic model of <a href="/wiki/Supply_and_demand" title="Supply and demand">supply and demand</a> describes scarcity, the Internet retail model is based on abundance. <a href="/wiki/Data_storage_device" title="Data storage device">Digital storage</a> costs are low, so a company can afford to make its whole recording inventory available online, giving customers as much choice as possible. It has thus become economically viable to offer music recordings that very few people are interested in. Consumers&apos; growing awareness of their increased choice results in a closer association between listening tastes and social identity, and the creation of thousands of <a href="/wiki/Niche_market" title="Niche market">niche markets</a>.</p>
<p>Another effect of the Internet arose with <a href="/wiki/Virtual_community" title="Virtual community">online communities</a> and <a href="/wiki/Social_media" title="Social media">social media</a> websites like <a href="/wiki/YouTube" title="YouTube">YouTube</a> and <a href="/wiki/Facebook" title="Facebook">Facebook</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Social_networking_service" title="Social networking service">social networking service</a>. These sites make it easier for aspiring singers and amateur bands to distribute videos of their songs, connect with other musicians, and gain audience interest. Professional musicians also use YouTube as a free publisher of promotional material. YouTube users, for example, no longer only download and listen to <a href="/wiki/MP3" title="MP3">MP3s</a>, but also actively create their own. According to <a href="/wiki/Don_Tapscott" title="Don Tapscott">Don Tapscott</a> and <a href="/wiki/Anthony_D._Williams_(author)" title="Anthony D. Williams (author)">Anthony D. Williams</a>, in their book <i><a href="/wiki/Wikinomics" title="Wikinomics">Wikinomics</a></i>, there has been a shift from a traditional consumer role to what they call a &quot;<a href="/wiki/Prosumer" title="Prosumer">prosumer</a>&quot; role, a consumer who both creates content and consumes. Manifestations of this in music include the production of <a href="/wiki/Mashup_(music)" title="Mashup (music)">mashes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Remix" title="Remix">remixes</a>, and music videos by fans.</p>

In <a href="/wiki/Elementary_school" title="Elementary school">elementary schools</a>, children often learn to play instruments such as the <a href="/wiki/Recorder_(musical_instrument)" title="Recorder (musical instrument)">recorder</a>, sing in small choirs, and learn about the history of Western art music and traditional music. Some elementary school children also learn about popular music styles. In religious schools, children sing <a href="/wiki/Hymn" title="Hymn">hymns</a> and other religious music. In secondary schools (and less commonly in elementary schools), students may have the opportunity to perform in some types of musical ensembles, such as <a href="/wiki/Choir" title="Choir">choirs</a> (a group of singers), <a href="/wiki/Marching_band" title="Marching band">marching bands</a>, <a href="/wiki/Concert_band" title="Concert band">concert bands</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jazz_band" title="Jazz band">jazz bands</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Orchestra" title="Orchestra">orchestras</a>. In some school systems, music lessons on how to play instruments may be provided. Some students also take private <a href="/wiki/Music_lesson" title="Music lesson">music lessons</a> after school with a singing teacher or instrument teacher. Amateur musicians typically learn basic musical rudiments (e.g., learning about <a href="/wiki/Musical_notation" title="Musical notation">musical notation</a> for <a href="/wiki/Musical_scale" class="mw-redirect" title="Musical scale">musical scales</a> and rhythms) and beginner- to intermediate-level singing or instrument-playing techniques.</p>
<p>At the <a href="/wiki/University" title="University">university</a> level, students in most arts and <a href="/wiki/Humanities" title="Humanities">humanities</a> programs can receive <a href="/wiki/Credit_(education)" class="mw-redirect" title="Credit (education)">credit</a> for taking a few music courses, which typically take the form of an overview course on the <a href="/wiki/History_of_music" title="History of music">history of music</a>, or a <a href="/wiki/Music_appreciation" title="Music appreciation">music appreciation</a> course that focuses on listening to music and learning about different musical styles. In addition, most North American and European universities have some types of musical ensembles that students in arts and humanities are able to participate in, such as choirs, marching bands, concert bands, or orchestras. The study of Western art music is increasingly common outside of North America and Europe, such as the <a href="/wiki/Indonesian_Institute_of_the_Arts,_Yogyakarta" title="Indonesian Institute of the Arts, Yogyakarta">Indonesian Institute of the Arts</a> in <a href="/wiki/Yogyakarta_(city)" class="mw-redirect" title="Yogyakarta (city)">Yogyakarta</a>, <a href="/wiki/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, or the classical music programs that are available in Asian countries such as South Korea, Japan, and China.

The Master of Music degree, which takes one to two years to complete, is typically awarded to students studying the performance of an instrument, education, voice (singing) or composition. The Master of Arts degree, which takes one to two years to complete and often requires a <a href="/wiki/Dissertation" class="mw-redirect" title="Dissertation">thesis</a>, is typically awarded to students studying musicology, music history, music theory or ethnomusicology.</p>
<p>The PhD, which is required for students who want to work as university <a href="/wiki/Professor" title="Professor">professors</a> in musicology, music history, or music theory, takes three to five years of study after the master&apos;s degree, during which time the student will complete advanced courses and undertake research for a dissertation. The DMA is a relatively new degree that was created to provide a credential for professional performers or composers that want to work as university professors in musical performance or composition. The DMA takes three to five years after a master&apos;s degree, and includes advanced courses, projects, and performances. In Medieval times, the study of music was one of the <a href="/wiki/Quadrivium" title="Quadrivium">Quadrivium</a> of the seven <a href="/wiki/Liberal_arts" class="mw-redirect" title="Liberal arts">Liberal Arts</a> and considered vital to higher learning.

<p><a href="/wiki/Musicology" title="Musicology">Musicology</a>, the academic study of the subject of music, is studied in universities and music conservatories. The earliest definitions from the 19th century defined three sub-disciplines of musicology: <a href="/wiki/Systematic_musicology" title="Systematic musicology">systematic musicology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Music_history" title="Music history">historical musicology</a>, and comparative musicology or <a href="/wiki/Ethnomusicology" title="Ethnomusicology">ethnomusicology</a>. In 2010-era scholarship, one is more likely to encounter a division of the discipline into <a href="/wiki/Music_theory" title="Music theory">music theory</a>, <a href="/wiki/Music_history" title="Music history">music history</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ethnomusicology" title="Ethnomusicology">ethnomusicology</a>. Research in musicology has often been enriched by cross-disciplinary work, for example in the field of <a href="/wiki/Psychoacoustics" title="Psychoacoustics">psychoacoustics</a>. The study of music of non-western cultures, and the cultural study of music, is called ethnomusicology. Students can pursue the undergraduate study of musicology, ethnomusicology, <a href="/wiki/Music_history" title="Music history">music history</a>, and music theory through several different types of degrees, including bachelor&apos;s degrees, master&apos;s degrees and PhD degrees.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Music_theory">Music theory</span></h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/Music_theory" title="Music theory">Music theory</a> is the study of music, generally in a highly technical manner outside of other disciplines.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Zoomusicology">Zoomusicology</span></h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/Zoomusicology" title="Zoomusicology">Zoomusicology</a> is the study of the music of non-human animals, or the musical aspects of sounds produced by non-human animals. As George Herzog (1941) asked, &quot;do animals have music?&quot; <a href="/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois-Bernard_M%C3%A2che" title="Fran&#xE7;ois-Bernard M&#xE2;che">Fran&#xE7;ois-Bernard M&#xE2;che</a>&apos;s <i>Musique, mythe, nature, ou les Dauphins d&apos;Arion</i> (1983), a study of &quot;ornitho-musicology&quot; using a technique of <a href="/wiki/Nicolas_Ruwet" title="Nicolas Ruwet">Nicolas Ruwet</a>&apos;s <i>Langage, musique, po&#xE9;sie</i> (1972) <a href="/wiki/Paradigmatic_analysis" title="Paradigmatic analysis">paradigmatic segmentation analysis</a>, shows that <a href="/wiki/Bird_vocalization" title="Bird vocalization">bird songs</a> are organised according to a repetition-transformation principle. Jean-Jacques Nattiez (1990), argues that &quot;in the last analysis, it is a human being who decides what is and is not musical, even when the sound is not of human origin. If we acknowledge that sound is not organised and conceptualised (that is, made to form music) merely by its producer, but by the mind that perceives it, then music is uniquely human.&quot;</p>

<p>In the West, much of the history of music that is taught deals with the Western civilization&apos;s art music, which is known as <a href="/wiki/Classical_music" title="Classical music">classical music</a>. The history of music in non-Western cultures (&quot;<a href="/wiki/World_music" title="World music">world music</a>&quot; or the field of &quot;ethnomusicology&quot;), which typically covers music from Africa and Asia is also taught in Western universities. This includes the documented classical traditions of Asian countries outside the influence of Western Europe, as well as the folk or indigenous music of various other cultures. Popular or folk styles of music in non-Western countries varied widely from culture to culture, and from period to period. Different cultures emphasised different <a href="/wiki/Musical_instrument" title="Musical instrument">instruments</a>, techniques, singing styles and uses for music. Music has been used for entertainment, ceremonies, rituals, religious purposes and for practical and artistic communication. Non-Western music has also been used for <a href="/wiki/Propaganda" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> purposes, as was the case with <a href="/wiki/Chinese_opera" title="Chinese opera">Chinese opera</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Cultural_Revolution" title="Cultural Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>There is a host of music classifications for non-Western music, many of which are caught up in the argument over the <a href="/wiki/Definition_of_music" title="Definition of music">definition of music</a>. Among the largest of these is the division between classical music (or &quot;art&quot; music), and popular music (or <a href="/wiki/Contemporary_commercial_music" title="Contemporary commercial music">commercial music</a> &#x2013; including non-Western styles of <a href="/wiki/Rock_music" title="Rock music">rock</a>, <a href="/wiki/Country_music" title="Country music">country</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Pop_music" title="Pop music">pop music</a>-related styles). Some genres do not fit neatly into one of these &quot;big two&quot; classifications, (such as <a href="/wiki/Folk_music" title="Folk music">folk music</a>, <a href="/wiki/World_music" title="World music">world music</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Jazz" title="Jazz">jazz</a>-related music).</p>
<p>As world cultures have come into <a href="/wiki/Globalization" title="Globalization">greater global contact</a>, their indigenous musical styles have often merged with other styles, which produces new styles. For example, the United States <a href="/wiki/Bluegrass_music" title="Bluegrass music">bluegrass</a> style contains elements from <a href="/wiki/Folk_Music_of_England" class="mw-redirect" title="Folk Music of England">Anglo</a>-<a href="/wiki/Music_of_Ireland" title="Music of Ireland">Irish</a>, <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Scotland" title="Music of Scotland">Scottish</a>, Irish, <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Germany" title="Music of Germany">German</a> and African instrumental and vocal traditions, which were able to fuse in the United States&apos; multi-ethnic &quot;<a href="/wiki/Melting_pot" title="Melting pot">melting pot</a>&quot; society. Some types of world music contain a mixture of non-Western indigenous styles with Western pop music elements. Genres of music are determined as much by tradition and presentation as by the actual music. Some works, like <a href="/wiki/George_Gershwin" title="George Gershwin">George Gershwin</a>&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/Rhapsody_in_Blue" title="Rhapsody in Blue">Rhapsody in Blue</a></i>, are claimed by both jazz and classical music, while Gershwin&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/Porgy_and_Bess" title="Porgy and Bess">Porgy and Bess</a></i> and <a href="/wiki/Leonard_Bernstein" title="Leonard Bernstein">Leonard Bernstein</a>&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/West_Side_Story_(musical)" class="mw-redirect" title="West Side Story (musical)">West Side Story</a></i> are claimed by both <a href="/wiki/Opera" title="Opera">opera</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Broadway_musical" class="mw-redirect" title="Broadway musical">Broadway musical</a> tradition. Many current music festivals for non-Western music include bands and singers from a particular musical genre, such as world music.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Music_of_India" title="Music of India">Indian music</a>, for example, is one of the oldest and longest living types of music, and is still widely heard and performed in South Asia, as well as internationally (especially since the 1960s). Indian music has mainly three forms of classical music, <a href="/wiki/Hindustani_classical_music" title="Hindustani classical music">Hindustani</a>, <a href="/wiki/Carnatic_music" title="Carnatic music">Carnatic</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Dhrupad" title="Dhrupad">Dhrupad</a> styles. It has also a large repertoire of styles, which involve only percussion music such as the talavadya performances famous in <a href="/wiki/South_India" title="South India">South India</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Music_therapy" title="Music therapy">Music therapy</a> is an interpersonal process in which the therapist uses music and all of its facets&#x2014;physical, emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and spiritual&#x2014;to help clients to improve or maintain their health. In some instances, the client&apos;s needs are addressed directly through music; in others they are addressed through the relationships that develop between the client and therapist. Music therapy is used with individuals of all ages and with a variety of conditions, including: psychiatric disorders, medical problems, physical handicaps, sensory impairments, developmental disabilities, substance abuse, communication disorders, interpersonal problems, and aging. It is also used to: improve learning, build self-esteem, reduce stress, <a href="/wiki/Exercise_and_music" title="Exercise and music">support physical exercise</a>, and facilitate a host of other health-related activities.</p>
<p>One of the earliest mentions of music therapy was in <a href="/wiki/Al-Farabi" title="Al-Farabi">Al-Farabi</a>&apos;s (c. 872 &#x2013; 950) treatise <i>Meanings of the Intellect</i>, which described the <a href="/wiki/Therapeutic" class="mw-redirect" title="Therapeutic">therapeutic</a> effects of music on the <a href="/wiki/Soul_(spirit)" class="mw-redirect" title="Soul (spirit)">soul</a>. Music has long been used to help people deal with their emotions. In the 17th century, the scholar <a href="/wiki/Robert_Burton_(scholar)" title="Robert Burton (scholar)">Robert Burton</a>&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Anatomy_of_Melancholy" title="The Anatomy of Melancholy">The Anatomy of Melancholy</a></i> argued that music and dance were critical in treating <a href="/wiki/Mental_disorder" title="Mental disorder">mental illness</a>, especially <a href="/wiki/Melancholia" title="Melancholia">melancholia</a>. He noted that music has an &quot;excellent power ...to expel many other diseases&quot; and he called it &quot;a sovereign remedy against despair and melancholy.&quot; He pointed out that in Antiquity, Canus, a Rhodian fiddler, used music to &quot;make a melancholy man merry, ...a lover more enamoured, a religious man more devout.&quot; In November 2006, Dr. Michael J. Crawford and his colleagues also found that music therapy helped <a href="/wiki/Schizophrenia" title="Schizophrenia">schizophrenic</a> patients. In the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, mental illnesses were treated with music.</p>
