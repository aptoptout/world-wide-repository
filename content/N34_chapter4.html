He became the first freshman in decades to start for Lower Merion&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Varsity_team" title="Varsity team">varsity team</a>, but the team finished with a 4&#x2013;20 record. The following three years, the Aces compiled a 77&#x2013;13 record, with Bryant playing all five positions. During his junior year, he averaged 31.1 points, 10.4 rebounds and 5.2 assists and was named Pennsylvania Player of the Year, attracting attention from college recruiters in the process. <a href="/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils_men%27s_basketball" title="Duke Blue Devils men&apos;s basketball">Duke</a>, <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina_Tar_Heels_men%27s_basketball" title="North Carolina Tar Heels men&apos;s basketball">North Carolina</a>, <a href="/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats_men%27s_basketball" title="Villanova Wildcats men&apos;s basketball">Villanova</a> and <a href="/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines_men%27s_basketball" title="Michigan Wolverines men&apos;s basketball">Michigan</a> were at the top of his list; however, when <a href="/wiki/Kevin_Garnett" title="Kevin Garnett">Kevin Garnett</a> went in the first round of the <a href="/wiki/1995_NBA_Draft" class="mw-redirect" title="1995 NBA Draft">1995 NBA Draft</a>, he began considering going directly to the pros.</p>
<p>At <a href="/wiki/Adidas" title="Adidas">Adidas</a> ABCD camp, Bryant earned the 1995 senior MVP award, while playing alongside future NBA teammate <a href="/wiki/Lamar_Odom" title="Lamar Odom">Lamar Odom</a>. While in high school, then 76ers coach <a href="/wiki/John_Lucas_II" title="John Lucas II">John Lucas</a> invited Bryant to work out and scrimmage with the team, where he played one-on-one with <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Stackhouse" title="Jerry Stackhouse">Jerry Stackhouse</a>. In his senior year of high school, Bryant led the Aces to their first state championship in 53 years. During the run, he averaged 30.8 points, 12 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 4.0 steals, and 3.8 blocked shots in leading the Aces to a 31&#x2013;3 record. Bryant ended his high school career as <a href="/wiki/Southeastern_Pennsylvania" class="mw-redirect" title="Southeastern Pennsylvania">Southeastern Pennsylvania</a>&apos;s all-time leading scorer at 2,883 points, surpassing both <a href="/wiki/Wilt_Chamberlain" title="Wilt Chamberlain">Wilt Chamberlain</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lionel_Simmons" title="Lionel Simmons">Lionel Simmons</a>.</p>
<p>Bryant received several awards for his performance his senior year including being named <a href="/wiki/Naismith_Prep_Player_of_the_Year_Award" title="Naismith Prep Player of the Year Award">Naismith High School Player of the Year</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gatorade" title="Gatorade">Gatorade</a> Men&apos;s National Basketball Player of the Year, a <a href="/wiki/McDonald%27s_All-American_Team" class="mw-redirect" title="McDonald&apos;s All-American Team">McDonald&apos;s All-American</a>, and a <i><a href="/wiki/USA_Today" title="USA Today">USA Today</a></i> All-USA First Team player. Bryant&apos;s varsity coach, Greg Downer, commented that he was &quot;a complete player who dominates&quot; and praised his work ethic, even as the team&apos;s top player. In 1996, Bryant took <a href="/wiki/Contemporary_R%26B" title="Contemporary R&amp;B">R&amp;B</a> singer <a href="/wiki/Brandy_Norwood" title="Brandy Norwood">Brandy</a> to his <a href="/wiki/Senior_prom" class="mw-redirect" title="Senior prom">senior prom</a>, though the two were, and remain, just friends. Ultimately, however, the 17-year-old Bryant made the decision to go <a href="/wiki/NBA_high_school_draftees" title="NBA high school draftees">directly into the NBA</a>, only the sixth player in NBA history to do so. Bryant&apos;s news was met with a lot of publicity at a time when <a href="/wiki/Prep-to-pro" class="mw-redirect" title="Prep-to-pro">prep-to-pro</a> NBA players were not very common (Garnett being the only exception in 20 years). His basketball skills and <a href="/wiki/SAT" title="SAT">SAT</a> score of 1080 would have ensured admission to any college he chose, but he did not officially visit any campuses.</p>
<p>In 2012, Bryant was honored as one of the 35 Greatest <a href="/wiki/McDonald%27s_All-American" class="mw-redirect" title="McDonald&apos;s All-American">McDonald&apos;s All-Americans</a>.</p>

<p>The first guard to ever be taken out of high school, Bryant was chosen as the 13th overall <a href="/wiki/1996_NBA_draft" title="1996 NBA draft">draft</a> pick by the <a href="/wiki/1996%E2%80%9397_Charlotte_Hornets_season" title="1996&#x2013;97 Charlotte Hornets season">Charlotte Hornets</a> in <a href="/wiki/1996_NBA_draft" title="1996 NBA draft">1996</a>. According to <a href="/wiki/Arn_Tellem" title="Arn Tellem">Arn Tellem</a>, Bryant&apos;s agent at the time, Bryant playing for the Charlotte Hornets was &quot;an impossibility&quot;. However, Bill Branch, the Hornets&apos; head scout at the time, said that the Hornets agreed to trade their draft selection to the Lakers before picking Bryant. The teams agreed to the trade the day before the draft and the Lakers told the Hornets whom to select five minutes before the pick was made. Branch said that prior to the trade agreement, the Hornets never even considered drafting Bryant. Prior to the draft, Bryant had worked out in Los Angeles, where he scrimmaged against former Lakers players <a href="/wiki/Larry_Drew" title="Larry Drew">Larry Drew</a> and <a href="/wiki/Michael_Cooper" title="Michael Cooper">Michael Cooper</a> and, according to then-Laker manager <a href="/wiki/Jerry_West" title="Jerry West">Jerry West</a>, &quot;marched over these people&quot;. On July 1, 1996, West traded his starting <a href="/wiki/Center_(basketball)" title="Center (basketball)">center</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vlade_Divac" title="Vlade Divac">Vlade Divac</a>, to the Hornets in exchange for Bryant&apos;s draft rights. Since he was still 17 at the time of the draft, his parents had to cosign his contract with the Lakers until he was able to sign his own when he turned 18 before the season began.</p>

He scored 36 points in the finale, and finished with averages of 24.5 points and 5.3 rebounds in four game. As a rookie in <a href="/wiki/1996%E2%80%9397_Los_Angeles_Lakers_season" title="1996&#x2013;97 Los Angeles Lakers season">1996&#x2013;97</a>, Bryant mostly came off the bench behind guards <a href="/wiki/Eddie_Jones_(basketball)" title="Eddie Jones (basketball)">Eddie Jones</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nick_Van_Exel" title="Nick Van Exel">Nick Van Exel</a>. At the time he became <a href="/wiki/List_of_youngest_National_Basketball_Association_players" class="mw-redirect" title="List of youngest National Basketball Association players">the youngest player ever to play in an NBA game</a> (18 years, 72 days; a record since broken by <a href="/wiki/Jermaine_O%27Neal" title="Jermaine O&apos;Neal">Jermaine O&apos;Neal</a> and former teammate <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Bynum" title="Andrew Bynum">Andrew Bynum</a>), and also became the youngest NBA starter ever (18 years, 158 days). Initially, Bryant played limited minutes, but as the season continued, he began to see some more playing time. By the end of the season, he averaged 15.5 minutes a game. During the <a href="/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Weekend" title="NBA All-Star Weekend">All-Star weekend</a>, Bryant participated in the <a href="/wiki/Rookie_Challenge" class="mw-redirect" title="Rookie Challenge">Rookie Challenge</a> and won the 1997 <a href="/wiki/Slam_Dunk_Contest" title="Slam Dunk Contest">Slam Dunk Contest</a>, becoming the youngest dunk champion ever at the age of 18.

Bryant shot four <a href="/wiki/Air_ball" title="Air ball">air balls</a> at the end of the game; the Jazz won 98&#x2013;93 in overtime to eliminate the Lakers 4&#x2013;1. He first whiffed a game-winning 2-point <a href="/wiki/Jump_shot_(basketball)" title="Jump shot (basketball)">jump shot</a> in the fourth quarter, and then misfired three <a href="/wiki/Three-point_field_goal" title="Three-point field goal">three-point field goals</a> in overtime, including two tying shots in the final minute. O&apos;Neal commented that &quot;[Bryant] was the only guy who had the guts at the time to take shots like that.&quot;</p>
<p>In Bryant&apos;s <a href="/wiki/1997%E2%80%9398_Los_Angeles_Lakers_season" title="1997&#x2013;98 Los Angeles Lakers season">second season</a>, he received more playing time and began to show more of his abilities as a talented young guard. As a result, Bryant&apos;s point averages more than doubled from 7.6 to 15.4 points per game. Bryant would see an increase in minutes when the Lakers &quot;played small&quot;, which would feature Bryant playing <a href="/wiki/Small_forward" title="Small forward">small forward</a> alongside the guards he would usually back up. Bryant was the runner-up for the <a href="/wiki/NBA_Sixth_Man_of_the_Year_Award" title="NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award">NBA&apos;s Sixth Man of the Year Award</a>, and through fan voting, he also became the youngest <a href="/wiki/National_Basketball_Association_All-Star_Game" class="mw-redirect" title="National Basketball Association All-Star Game">NBA All-Star</a> starter in NBA history. He was joined by teammates O&apos;Neal, Van Exel, and Jones, making it the first time since 1983 that four players on the same team were selected to play in the same All-Star Game. Bryant&apos;s 15.4 points per game was the highest of any non-starter in the season.</p>

With starting guards Van Exel and Jones traded, Bryant started every game for the lockout-shortened 50-game season. During the season, Bryant signed a 6-year contract extension worth $70&#xA0;million. This kept him with the Lakers until the end of the 2003&#x2013;04 season.

<p>Bryant started the <a href="/wiki/1999%E2%80%932000_NBA_season" title="1999&#x2013;2000 NBA season">1999&#x2013;2000</a> season sidelined for six weeks due to an injury to his hand suffered during a preseason game against the <a href="/wiki/1999%E2%80%932000_Washington_Wizards_season" title="1999&#x2013;2000 Washington Wizards season">Washington Wizards</a>. With Bryant back and playing over 38 minutes a game, he saw an increase in all statistical categories in the 1999&#x2013;2000 season. This included leading the team in assists per game and steals per game. The duo of O&apos;Neal and Bryant backed with a strong bench led to the Lakers winning 67 games, tied for fifth-most in NBA history. This followed with O&apos;Neal winning the MVP and Bryant being named to the <a href="/wiki/All-NBA" class="mw-redirect" title="All-NBA">All-NBA Team</a> Second Team and All-NBA Defensive Team for the first time in his career (the youngest player ever to receive defensive honors). While playing second fiddle to O&apos;Neal in the playoffs, Bryant had some clutch performances including a 25-point, 11 rebound, 7 assist, 4 block game in game 7 of the Western Conference finals against the <a href="/wiki/1999%E2%80%932000_Portland_Trail_Blazers_season" title="1999&#x2013;2000 Portland Trail Blazers season">Portland Trail Blazers</a>. He also threw an alley-oop pass to O&apos;Neal to clinch the game and the series. In the <a href="/wiki/2000_NBA_Finals" title="2000 NBA Finals">2000 NBA Finals</a> against the <a href="/wiki/1999%E2%80%932000_Indiana_Pacers_season" title="1999&#x2013;2000 Indiana Pacers season">Indiana Pacers</a>, Bryant injured his ankle in the second quarter of Game 2 after landing on the Pacers&apos; <a href="/wiki/Jalen_Rose" title="Jalen Rose">Jalen Rose</a>&apos;s foot. Rose later admitted he placed his foot under Bryant intentionally. Bryant did not return to the game, and he also missed Game 3 due to the injury. In Game 4, Bryant scored 22 points in the second half, and led the team to an OT victory as O&apos;Neal fouled out of the game. Bryant scored the winning shot to put the Lakers ahead 120&#x2013;118. With a 116&#x2013;111 Game 6 victory, the Lakers won their first championship since <a href="/wiki/1988_NBA_Finals" title="1988 NBA Finals">1988</a>.</p>
<p>Statistically, the <a href="/wiki/2000%E2%80%9301_NBA_season" title="2000&#x2013;01 NBA season">2000&#x2013;01</a> season saw Bryant perform similarly to the previous year, but he averaged 6 more points a game (28.5). It was also the year when disagreements between Bryant and O&apos;Neal began to surface. Once again he led the team in assists with 5 per game. The Lakers however, only won 56 games, an 11-game drop off from last year. The Lakers would respond by going 15&#x2013;1 in the playoffs. They easily swept the <a href="/wiki/2000%E2%80%9301_Portland_Trail_Blazers_season" title="2000&#x2013;01 Portland Trail Blazers season">Portland Trail Blazers</a>, <a href="/wiki/2000%E2%80%9301_Sacramento_Kings_season" title="2000&#x2013;01 Sacramento Kings season">Sacramento Kings</a>, and <a href="/wiki/2000%E2%80%9301_San_Antonio_Spurs_season" title="2000&#x2013;01 San Antonio Spurs season">San Antonio Spurs</a>, before losing their first game against the <a href="/wiki/2000%E2%80%9301_Philadelphia_76ers_season" title="2000&#x2013;01 Philadelphia 76ers season">Philadelphia 76ers</a> in OT. They would go on to win the next 4 games and bring their second championship to Los Angeles in as many seasons. During the playoffs, Bryant played heavy minutes which brought his stats up to 29.4 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 6.1 assists per game. In the playoffs, teammate O&apos;Neal declared Bryant the best player in the league. Bryant ended up making the All NBA Second team and All NBA Defensive Team for the second year in a row. In addition, he was also voted to start in the NBA All-Star Game for the 3rd year in a row (no game in 1999).</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/2001%E2%80%9302_NBA_season" title="2001&#x2013;02 NBA season">2001&#x2013;02 season</a>, Bryant played 80 games for the first time in his career. He continued his all-round play by averaging 25.2 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game. He also had a career high 46.9% shooting and once again led his team in assists. He claimed his first <a href="/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game_Most_Valuable_Player_Award" title="NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award">All-Star MVP trophy</a> after a 31-point performance in Philadelphia, when he was loudly booed by fans as they had throughout the game, stemming from his earlier comment to a 76ers heckler during the Finals that the Lakers were &quot;going to cut your hearts out&quot;. While making the All-NBA Defensive team again, he was also promoted to the All-NBA First Team for the first time in his career. The Lakers won 58 games that year and finished second place in the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Division_(NBA)" title="Pacific Division (NBA)">Pacific Division</a> behind in-state rival <a href="/wiki/2001%E2%80%9302_Sacramento_Kings_season" title="2001&#x2013;02 Sacramento Kings season">Sacramento Kings</a>. Bryant was suspended one game after he punched <a href="/wiki/Reggie_Miller" title="Reggie Miller">Reggie Miller</a> of the <a href="/wiki/2001%E2%80%9302_Indiana_Pacers_season" title="2001&#x2013;02 Indiana Pacers season">Indiana Pacers</a> after the Lakers&apos; March 1, 2002 victory over the Pacers.</p>
<p>The road to the Finals would prove a lot tougher than the record run the Lakers had the previous year. While the Lakers swept the <a href="/wiki/2001%E2%80%9302_Portland_Trail_Blazers_season" title="2001&#x2013;02 Portland Trail Blazers season">Blazers</a> and defeated the <a href="/wiki/2001%E2%80%9302_San_Antonio_Spurs_season" title="2001&#x2013;02 San Antonio Spurs season">Spurs</a> 4&#x2013;1, the Lakers did not have home court advantage against the <a href="/wiki/2001%E2%80%9302_Sacramento_Kings_season" title="2001&#x2013;02 Sacramento Kings season">Sacramento Kings</a>. The series would stretch to 7 games, the first time this happened to the Lakers since the 2000 Western Conference Finals. However, the Lakers were able to beat their division rivals and make their third consecutive <a href="/wiki/NBA_Finals" title="NBA Finals">NBA Finals</a> appearance. In the <a href="/wiki/2002_NBA_Finals" title="2002 NBA Finals">2002 Finals</a>, Bryant averaged 26.8 points, 51.4% shooting, 5.8 rebounds, 5.3 assists per game, which included scoring a quarter of the teams points. At age 23, Bryant became the youngest player to win three championships. Bryant&apos;s play was notable and praised for his performance in the 4th quarter of games, specifically the last 2 rounds of the playoffs. This cemented Bryant&apos;s reputation as a &quot;clutch player&quot;.</p>

<p>In the <a href="/wiki/2002%E2%80%9303_NBA_season" title="2002&#x2013;03 NBA season">2002&#x2013;03</a> season, Bryant set an NBA record for three-pointers on January 7, 2003, making 12 against the <a href="/wiki/Seattle_SuperSonics" title="Seattle SuperSonics">Seattle SuperSonics</a>. He averaged 30 points per game and embarked on a historic run, posting <a href="/wiki/List_of_40-plus_point_games_by_Kobe_Bryant" title="List of 40-plus point games by Kobe Bryant">40 or more points</a> in nine consecutive games while averaging 40.6 in the entire month of February. In addition, he averaged 6.9 <a href="/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)" title="Rebound (basketball)">rebounds</a>, 5.9 <a href="/wiki/Assist_(basketball)" title="Assist (basketball)">assists</a>, and 2.2 <a href="/wiki/Steal_(basketball)" title="Steal (basketball)">steals</a> per game, all career highs to that point. Bryant was once again voted to both the All-NBA and All-Defensive 1st teams, and came in third place in voting for the MVP award. After finishing 50&#x2013;32 in the regular season, the Lakers floundered <a href="/wiki/2003_NBA_Playoffs" title="2003 NBA Playoffs">in the playoffs</a> and lost in the Western Conference semi-finals to the eventual NBA champions <a href="/wiki/2002%E2%80%9303_San_Antonio_Spurs_season" title="2002&#x2013;03 San Antonio Spurs season">San Antonio Spurs</a> in six games.</p>
<p>In the following <a href="/wiki/2003%E2%80%9304_NBA_season" title="2003&#x2013;04 NBA season">2003&#x2013;04</a> season, the Lakers were able to acquire NBA All-Stars <a href="/wiki/Karl_Malone" title="Karl Malone">Karl Malone</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Gary_Payton" title="Gary Payton">Gary Payton</a> to make another push at the NBA Championship. Before the season began, Bryant was arrested for sexual assault. This caused Bryant to miss some games due to court appearances or attend court earlier in the day and travel to play games later in same day. In the final game of the regular season, the Lakers played the <a href="/wiki/2003%E2%80%9304_Portland_Trail_Blazers_season" title="2003&#x2013;04 Portland Trail Blazers season">Portland Trail Blazers</a>. Bryant made two buzzer beaters to win the game and the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Division_(NBA)" title="Pacific Division (NBA)">Pacific Division</a> title. At the end of the fourth quarter, Bryant made a 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds left to send it into overtime. The game eventually went to a second overtime, in which Bryant made another 3-pointer as time expired to lift the Lakers past the Blazers, 105&#x2013;104.</p>
<p>With a starting lineup of O&apos;Neal, Malone, Payton, and Bryant, the Lakers were able to reach <a href="/wiki/2004_NBA_Finals" title="2004 NBA Finals">the NBA Finals</a>. However, they were upset in five games by the <a href="/wiki/2003%E2%80%9304_Detroit_Pistons_season" title="2003&#x2013;04 Detroit Pistons season">Detroit Pistons</a>, who won their first championship since <a href="/wiki/1990_NBA_Finals" title="1990 NBA Finals">1990</a>. In that series, Bryant averaged 22.6 points per game and 4.4 assists. He shot 35.1% from the field. Jackson&apos;s contract as coach was not renewed, and <a href="/wiki/Rudy_Tomjanovich" title="Rudy Tomjanovich">Rudy Tomjanovich</a> took over. O&apos;Neal was traded to the <a href="/wiki/2004%E2%80%9305_Miami_Heat_season" title="2004&#x2013;05 Miami Heat season">Miami Heat</a> for <a href="/wiki/Lamar_Odom" title="Lamar Odom">Lamar Odom</a>, <a href="/wiki/Caron_Butler" title="Caron Butler">Caron Butler</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Brian_Grant" title="Brian Grant">Brian Grant</a>.

<p>Bryant was closely scrutinized and criticized during the <a href="/wiki/2004%E2%80%9305_Los_Angeles_Lakers_season" title="2004&#x2013;05 Los Angeles Lakers season">2004&#x2013;05 season</a> with his reputation badly damaged from all that had happened over the previous year. A particularly damaging salvo came when Jackson wrote <i><a href="/wiki/The_Last_Season:_A_Team_in_Search_of_Its_Soul" title="The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul">The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul</a></i>. The book detailed the events of the Lakers&apos; tumultuous <a href="/wiki/2003%E2%80%9304_NBA_season" title="2003&#x2013;04 NBA season">2003&#x2013;04 season</a> and has a number of criticisms of Bryant. In the book, Jackson called Bryant &quot;un-coachable&quot;. Midway through the season, Tomjanovich suddenly resigned as Lakers coach, citing the recurrence of health problems and exhaustion. Without Tomjanovich, stewardship of the remainder of the Lakers&apos; season fell to career assistant coach <a href="/wiki/Frank_Hamblen" title="Frank Hamblen">Frank Hamblen</a>. Bryant was the league&apos;s second-leading scorer at 27.6 points per game, but he was surrounded by a subpar supporting cast, and the Lakers went 34&#x2013;48 and missed the playoffs for the first time in over a decade. The year signified a drop in Bryant&apos;s overall status in the NBA, as he did not make the NBA All-Defensive Team and was also demoted to the All-NBA Third Team. During the season, Bryant also engaged in public feuds with Malone and <a href="/wiki/Ray_Allen" title="Ray Allen">Ray Allen</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/2005%E2%80%9306_NBA_season" title="2005&#x2013;06 NBA season">2005&#x2013;06 NBA season</a> would mark a crossroads in Bryant&apos;s basketball career. Despite past differences with Bryant, Jackson returned to coach the Lakers. Bryant endorsed the move, and by all appearances, the two men worked together well the second time around, leading the Lakers <a href="/wiki/2006_NBA_Playoffs" title="2006 NBA Playoffs">back into the playoffs</a>. Bryant&apos;s individual scoring accomplishments posted resulted in the finest statistical season of his career. On December 20, 2005, Bryant scored 62 points in three quarters against the <a href="/wiki/2005%E2%80%9306_Dallas_Mavericks_season" title="2005&#x2013;06 Dallas Mavericks season">Dallas Mavericks</a>. Entering the fourth quarter, Bryant outscored the entire Mavericks team 62&#x2013;61, the only time a player has done this through three quarters since the introduction of the <a href="/wiki/Shot_clock" title="Shot clock">shot clock</a>. When the Lakers faced the <a href="/wiki/2005%E2%80%9306_Miami_Heat_season" title="2005&#x2013;06 Miami Heat season">Miami Heat</a> on January 16, 2006, Bryant and Shaquille O&apos;Neal made headlines by engaging in handshakes and hugs before the game, signifying a change in <a href="/wiki/Bryant%E2%80%93O%27Neal_feud" class="mw-redirect" title="Bryant&#x2013;O&apos;Neal feud">the feud</a> that had festered between them.

<p>On January 22, 2006, Bryant scored a career-high 81 points in a 122&#x2013;104 victory against the <a href="/wiki/2005%E2%80%9306_Toronto_Raptors_season" title="2005&#x2013;06 Toronto Raptors season">Toronto Raptors</a>. In addition to breaking the previous franchise record of 71 set by <a href="/wiki/Elgin_Baylor" title="Elgin Baylor">Elgin Baylor</a>, Bryant&apos;s 81-point game was the second-highest point total in NBA history, surpassed only by <a href="/wiki/Wilt_Chamberlain%27s_100-point_game" title="Wilt Chamberlain&apos;s 100-point game">Chamberlain&apos;s 100-point game</a> in <a href="/wiki/1961%E2%80%9362_NBA_season" title="1961&#x2013;62 NBA season">1962</a>. Whereas Chamberlain was fed repeatedly by teammates for inside shots in a blowout win, Bryant created his own shot&#x2014;mostly from the outside&#x2014;in a game which the Lakers trailed at halftime by 14 and did not pull away until the fourth quarter. Chamberlain, playing in an era when the games were paced faster and scoring opportunities were more plentiful, accounted for 59 percent of his team&apos;s points in Philadelphia&apos;s 169&#x2013;147 win, compared to Bryant scoring 66 percent of the Lakers&apos; 122 points. In that same month, Bryant also became the first player since <a href="/wiki/1963%E2%80%9364_NBA_season" title="1963&#x2013;64 NBA season">1964</a> to score 45 points or more in four consecutive games, joining Chamberlain and Baylor as the only players ever to do so. For the month of January, Bryant averaged 43.4 points per game, the eighth highest single month scoring average in NBA history and highest for any player other than Chamberlain. By the end of the 2005&#x2013;06 season, Bryant set Lakers single-season franchise records for most 40-point games (27) and most points scored (2,832). He won the <a href="/wiki/List_of_National_Basketball_Association_season_scoring_leaders" class="mw-redirect" title="List of National Basketball Association season scoring leaders">league&apos;s scoring title</a> for the first time by averaging 35.4 points per game, becoming just the fifth player in league history to <a href="/wiki/List_of_National_Basketball_Association_top_individual_scoring_season_averages" class="mw-redirect" title="List of National Basketball Association top individual scoring season averages">average at least 35 in a season</a>. Bryant finished in fourth place in the voting for the 2006 <a href="/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award" title="NBA Most Valuable Player Award">NBA Most Valuable Player Award</a>, but received 22 first place votes&#x2014;second only to winner <a href="/wiki/Steve_Nash" title="Steve Nash">Steve Nash</a>. The Los Angeles Lakers posted a 45&#x2013;37 record, an eleven-game improvement over the previous season, and the entire squad seemed to be clicking.</p>
<p>Later in the season, it was reported that Bryant would change his jersey number from 8 to 24 at the start of the <a href="/wiki/2006%E2%80%9307_NBA_season" title="2006&#x2013;07 NBA season">2006&#x2013;07 NBA season</a>. Bryant&apos;s first high school number was 24 before he switched to 33. After the Lakers&apos; season ended, Bryant said on <a href="/wiki/Turner_Network_Television" class="mw-redirect" title="Turner Network Television">TNT</a> that he wanted 24 as a rookie, but it was unavailable, as was 33, retired with <a href="/wiki/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar" title="Kareem Abdul-Jabbar">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a>. Bryant wore 143 at the <a href="/wiki/Adidas" title="Adidas">Adidas ABCD camp</a>, and chose 8 by adding those numbers. In the first round of the playoffs, the Lakers played well enough to reach a 3&#x2013;1 series lead over the <a href="/wiki/2005%E2%80%9306_Phoenix_Suns_season" title="2005&#x2013;06 Phoenix Suns season">Phoenix Suns</a>, culminating with Bryant&apos;s OT-forcing and game-winning shots in Game 4. They came within six seconds of eliminating the second-seeded Suns in Game 6, however, they lost that game 126&#x2013;118 in overtime. Despite Bryant&apos;s 27.9 points per game in the series, the Lakers broke down, and ultimately fell to the Suns in seven games. After scoring 50 points on 20 of 35 shooting in the Game 6 loss, Bryant was criticized for only taking three shots in the second half of the 121&#x2013;90 Game 7 loss to Phoenix. In the 2006 off-season, Bryant had knee surgery, preventing him from participating in the <a href="/wiki/2006_FIBA_World_Championship" title="2006 FIBA World Championship">2006 FIBA World Championship</a> tournament.</p>

<p>During the <a href="/wiki/2006%E2%80%9307_NBA_season" title="2006&#x2013;07 NBA season">2006&#x2013;07 season</a>, Bryant was selected to his 9th All-Star Game appearance, and on February 18, he logged 31 points, 6 assists, and 6 steals, earning his second career All-Star Game MVP trophy. Over the course of the season, Bryant became involved in a number of on court incidents. On January 28 while attempting to draw contact on a potential game winning jumpshot, he flailed his arm, striking <a href="/wiki/2006%E2%80%9307_San_Antonio_Spurs_season" title="2006&#x2013;07 San Antonio Spurs season">San Antonio Spurs</a> guard <a href="/wiki/Manu_Gin%C3%B3bili" title="Manu Gin&#xF3;bili">Manu Gin&#xF3;bili</a> in the face with his elbow.

The basis given for the suspension was that Bryant had performed an &quot;unnatural motion&quot; in swinging his arm backwards. Later, on March 6, he seemed to repeat the motion, this time striking <a href="/wiki/2006%E2%80%9307_Minnesota_Timberwolves_season" title="2006&#x2013;07 Minnesota Timberwolves season">Minnesota Timberwolves</a> guard <a href="/wiki/Marko_Jari%C4%87" title="Marko Jari&#x107;">Marko Jari&#x107;</a>. On March 7, the NBA handed Bryant his second one-game suspension. In his first game back on March 9, he elbowed <a href="/wiki/Kyle_Korver" title="Kyle Korver">Kyle Korver</a> in the face which was retroactively re-classified as a Type 1 <a href="/wiki/Flagrant_foul" title="Flagrant foul">flagrant foul</a>.</p>
<p>On March 16, Bryant scored a season-high 65 points in a home game against the <a href="/wiki/2006%E2%80%9307_Portland_Trail_Blazers_season" title="2006&#x2013;07 Portland Trail Blazers season">Portland Trail Blazers</a>, which helped end the Lakers 7-game losing streak. This was the second-best scoring performance of his 11-year career. The following game, Bryant recorded 50 points against the Minnesota Timberwolves, after which he scored 60 points in a road win against the <a href="/wiki/Memphis_Grizzlies" title="Memphis Grizzlies">Memphis Grizzlies</a>&#x2014;becoming the second Laker to score three straight 50-plus point games, a feat not seen since Jordan last did it in 1987. The only other Laker to do so was Baylor, who also scored 50+ in three consecutive contests in December 1962. In the following day, in a game against the <a href="/wiki/2006%E2%80%9307_New_Orleans_Hornets_season" class="mw-redirect" title="2006&#x2013;07 New Orleans Hornets season">New Orleans Hornets</a>, Bryant scored 50 points, making him the second player in NBA history to have four straight 50-point games behind Chamberlain, who achieved it twice with streaks of five and seven. Bryant finished the year with a total of ten 50-plus point games, matched only by Chamberlain. Bryant also won his second straight scoring title that season. Throughout the 2006&#x2013;07 season, his jersey became the top selling NBA jersey in the United States and China. A number of journalists have attributed the improved sales to Bryant&apos;s new number, as well as his continuing All-Star performance on the court. In the <a href="/wiki/2007_NBA_Playoffs" title="2007 NBA Playoffs">2007 NBA Playoffs</a>, the Lakers were once again eliminated in the first round by the <a href="/wiki/2006%E2%80%9307_Phoenix_Suns_season" title="2006&#x2013;07 Phoenix Suns season">Phoenix Suns</a>, 4&#x2013;1.</p>

<p>On December 23, 2007, Bryant became the youngest player (29 years, 122 days) to reach 20,000 points, in a game against the <a href="/wiki/2007%E2%80%9308_New_York_Knicks_season" title="2007&#x2013;08 New York Knicks season">New York Knicks</a>, in Madison Square Garden. This record has since been broken by <a href="/wiki/LeBron_James" title="LeBron James">LeBron James</a>. Despite an injury to his shooting hand&apos;s small finger, described as &quot;a complete tear of the <a href="/wiki/Radial_collateral_ligament_(thumb)" class="mw-redirect" title="Radial collateral ligament (thumb)">radial collateral ligament</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Avulsion_fracture" title="Avulsion fracture">avulsion fracture</a>, and a volar plate injury at the MCP joint&quot; that occurred in a game on February 5, 2008, Bryant played all 82 games of the regular season instead of opting for surgery. Regarding his injury, he stated, &quot;I would prefer to delay any surgical procedure until after our Lakers season, and this summer&apos;s Olympic Games. But, this is an injury that myself [<i><a href="/wiki/Sic" title="Sic">sic</a></i>] and the Lakers&apos; medical staff will just have to continue to monitor on a day-to-day basis.&quot; In early September 2008, Bryant decided not to have surgery to repair the injury.</p>
<p>Aided by the signing of Spanish All-Star <a href="/wiki/Pau_Gasol" title="Pau Gasol">Pau Gasol</a>, Bryant lead his team to a West best 57&#x2013;25 record. The Lakers swept the <a href="/wiki/2007%E2%80%9308_Denver_Nuggets_season" title="2007&#x2013;08 Denver Nuggets season">Nuggets</a> in the first round and on May 6, 2008, and Bryant was officially announced as the league MVP. He said, &quot;It&apos;s been a long ride. I&apos;m very proud to represent this organization, to represent this city.&quot; West, who was responsible for bringing Bryant to the Lakers, was on hand at the press conference to observe Bryant receive his MVP trophy from NBA commissioner David Stern. He stated, &quot;Kobe deserved it. He&apos;s had just another great season. Doesn&apos;t surprise me one bit.&quot; In addition to winning his MVP award, Bryant was the only unanimous selection to the All-NBA team on May 8, 2008 for the third straight season and sixth time in his career. He would then headline the NBA All-Defensive First Team with <a href="/wiki/Kevin_Garnett" title="Kevin Garnett">Kevin Garnett</a>, receiving 52 points overall including 24 first-place nods, earning his eighth selection.</p>
<p>The Lakers concluded the 2007&#x2013;08 regular season with a 57&#x2013;25 record, finishing first in the Western Conference and setting up themselves for a first-round contest against the Nuggets. In Game 1, Bryant, who said he made himself a decoy through most of the game, scored 18 of his 32 points in the final 8 minutes to keep Los Angeles safely ahead. That made Denver the first 50-win team to be swept out of the first round of the playoffs since the <a href="/wiki/2003%E2%80%9304_Memphis_Grizzlies_season" title="2003&#x2013;04 Memphis Grizzlies season">Memphis Grizzlies</a> fell in four to the <a href="/wiki/2003%E2%80%9304_San_Antonio_Spurs_season" title="2003&#x2013;04 San Antonio Spurs season">San Antonio Spurs</a> in 2004. In the first game of the next round against the <a href="/wiki/2007%E2%80%9308_Utah_Jazz_season" title="2007&#x2013;08 Utah Jazz season">Jazz</a>, Bryant scored 38 points as the Lakers beat the Jazz in Game 1. The Lakers won the next game as well, but dropped Games 3 and 4, even with Bryant putting up 33.5 points per game. The Lakers then won the next two games to win the semifinals in 6. This set up a <a href="/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals#Conference_Finals_2" title="NBA Conference Finals">Western Conference Finals</a> berth against the <a href="/wiki/2007%E2%80%9308_San_Antonio_Spurs_season" title="2007&#x2013;08 San Antonio Spurs season">San Antonio Spurs</a>. The Lakers defeated the Spurs in 5 games, sending themselves to the <a href="/wiki/NBA_Finals" title="NBA Finals">NBA Finals</a> against the <a href="/wiki/2007%E2%80%9308_Boston_Celtics_season" title="2007&#x2013;08 Boston Celtics season">Boston Celtics</a>.

He also suffered a broken nose and a concussion in the third quarter of the All-Star Game after a hard foul from <a href="/wiki/Dwyane_Wade" title="Dwyane Wade">Dwyane Wade</a>. In April, Bryant missed seven games with a bruised left shin. He returned three games before the end of the regular season. In the last game of the regular season, against Sacramento, he chose not to go for a possible third NBA scoring title, having needed 38 points to surpass Kevin Durant. The Lakers were knocked out of the playoffs by Durant&apos;s Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round of the playoffs, losing in five games.</p>
<p>The Lakers in <a href="/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_Los_Angeles_Lakers_season" title="2012&#x2013;13 Los Angeles Lakers season">2012&#x2013;13</a> acquired center <a href="/wiki/Dwight_Howard" title="Dwight Howard">Dwight Howard</a> and point guard Steve Nash. On November 2, 2012, Bryant scored 40 points with two steals, and he passed <a href="/wiki/Magic_Johnson" title="Magic Johnson">Magic Johnson</a> (1,724) as the Lakers career leader in steals. However, the Lakers lost the game to the Clippers and started the season 0&#x2013;3 for the first time in 34 years and just the fourth time in franchise history. After starting the season 1&#x2013;4, coach Brown was fired. He was replaced by <a href="/wiki/Mike_D%27Antoni" title="Mike D&apos;Antoni">Mike D&apos;Antoni</a>, who Bryant knew as a child when Bryant&apos;s father was playing in Italy and D&apos;Antoni was also a star player there. Bryant had grown close with D&apos;Antoni during their time with Team USA. On December 5 against New Orleans, Bryant became the youngest player (34 years and 104 days) in league history to score 30,000 points, joining Hall of Famers Chamberlain, Jordan, <a href="/wiki/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar" title="Kareem Abdul-Jabbar">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Karl_Malone" title="Karl Malone">Karl Malone</a> as one of five players to reach that milestone. On December 18, in a 101&#x2013;100 win over the <a href="/wiki/Charlotte_Bobcats" class="mw-redirect" title="Charlotte Bobcats">Charlotte Bobcats</a>, Bryant scored 30+ points in his seventh consecutive game, the longest streak ever by an NBA player after turning 34 years old; it was the fourth-longest such streak in his career. His streak would be snapped at 10 on December 28 in a 104&#x2013;87 win over the <a href="/wiki/Portland_Trail_Blazers" title="Portland Trail Blazers">Portland Trail Blazers</a>, when he scored 27 points, sitting out the whole fourth quarter. In a move to improve the team&apos;s defense, D&apos;Antoni began having Bryant guard the opponent&apos;s best perimeter player; Bryant was the primary defender on the Cavaliers&apos; <a href="/wiki/Kyrie_Irving" title="Kyrie Irving">Kyrie Irving</a>, who was held to 15 points. Bryant acknowledged he was a more focused defender when he had a challenging defensive assignment as opposed to when he played off the ball against weaker players. His defense disrupted opponents and freed Nash from unfavorable matchups.</p>

<p>Bryant was leading the league in scoring though much of the first 42 games. With a disappointing 17&#x2013;25 start to the season, D&apos;Antoni had Bryant became the primary facilitator on offense and Nash was moved off the ball and became more of a spot-up shooter. In the next three games, Bryant had at least 10 assists in three wins with a three-game total of 39 assists, the most in his career. He missed a triple double in each game with nine rebounds twice and eight in the other. In two crucial wins in March, he scored at least 40 points and had at least 10 assists in back-to-back games, becoming the first Laker to accomplish the feat since West in 1970.</p>
<p>With the Lakers fighting to secure the eighth and final playoff berth in the <a href="/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)" title="Western Conference (NBA)">Western Conference</a>, coupled with injuries on the team, Bryant began playing almost all 48 minutes each game. On April 10, 2013, Bryant became the first player in NBA history to get 47 points, eight rebounds, five assists, four blocks and three steals in an NBA game. On April 12, Bryant suffered a <a href="/wiki/Torn_Achilles_tendon" class="mw-redirect" title="Torn Achilles tendon">torn Achilles tendon</a> against the <a href="/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors" title="Golden State Warriors">Golden State Warriors</a>, ending his season. His injury came while he was playing seven consecutive quarters and at least 40 minutes for seven consecutive games. The 34-year-old Bryant was averaging his most minutes (38.6) in six years, and only Portland rookie <a href="/wiki/Damian_Lillard" title="Damian Lillard">Damian Lillard</a> was averaging more minutes. Lakers general manager <a href="/wiki/Mitch_Kupchak" title="Mitch Kupchak">Mitch Kupchak</a> had spoken to Bryant about his extensive playing time 10 days earlier, but Bryant insisted the minutes needed to continue given the Lakers&apos; playoff push. Bryant had surgery on April 13 to repair the tear, and it was estimated he would miss six to nine months. He ended the season with his customary numbers scoring average of 27.3 points, 46.3 percent shooting, 5.6 rebounds and 6 assists. However, <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> called his leading of the Lakers back into playoff contention &quot;perhaps some of the finest work of his career.&quot; Eight times he reached 40 points during the season, and eleven times he had 10 or more assists in his role as distributor, dubbed &quot;Magic Mamba&quot; after the passing skills of <a href="/wiki/Magic_Johnson" title="Magic Johnson">Magic Johnson</a>. Bryant&apos;s assists were the second-highest of his career and his field goal percentage was its highest since 2008&#x2013;09.</p>

<p>Bryant resumed practicing starting in November, after the start of the <a href="/wiki/2013%E2%80%9314_Los_Angeles_Lakers_season" title="2013&#x2013;14 Los Angeles Lakers season">2013&#x2013;14 season</a>. On November 25, he signed a two-year contract extension with the Lakers at an estimated value of $48.5 million that would make him the first NBA player to play 20 years with the same franchise. He remained the league&apos;s highest-paid player, despite accepting the discounted deal; he had been eligible to receive an extension starting at $32 million per year. His contract became a polarizing topic, with detractors arguing that stars should take less money to allow their teams more financial freedom, while supporters countered that the NBA&apos;s biggest stars were being paid less than their true value. Bryant resumed playing on December 8 after missing the season&apos;s first 19 games. On December 17, Bryant matched his season high of 21 points in a 96&#x2013;92 win over Memphis, but he suffered a <a href="/wiki/Lateral_tibial_plateau_fracture" class="mw-redirect" title="Lateral tibial plateau fracture">lateral tibial plateau fracture</a> in his left knee that was expected to sideline him for six weeks. He had played six games since returning from his Achilles injury, which included time at point guard after injuries to Nash, <a href="/wiki/Steve_Blake" title="Steve Blake">Steve Blake</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Jordan_Farmar" title="Jordan Farmar">Jordan Farmar</a>. Bryant was averaging 13.8 points, 6.3 assists, and 4.3 rebounds. Despite being sidelined, he was voted by fans to start in <a href="/wiki/2014_NBA_All-Star_Game" title="2014 NBA All-Star Game">his 16th All-Star game</a>. Bryant did not feel he was deserving of the selection, and some likened it to a career achievement award for his past performance. However, he missed playing in the game, still hampered by his knee. On March 12, 2014, the Lakers ruled Bryant out for the remainder of the season, citing his need for more rehab and the limited time remaining in the season. At the time, the team was 22&#x2013;42 and tied for the worst record in the Western Conference. The Lakers finished 27&#x2013;55 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2005.</p>
<p>Bryant returned for the <a href="/wiki/2014%E2%80%9315_Los_Angeles_Lakers_season" title="2014&#x2013;15 Los Angeles Lakers season">2014&#x2013;15 season</a>, his 19th season with the Lakers, who had replaced D&apos;Antoni with Bryant&apos;s former Lakers teammate, <a href="/wiki/Byron_Scott" title="Byron Scott">Byron Scott</a>. On November 30, 2014, in a 129&#x2013;122 overtime victory against the <a href="/wiki/Toronto_Raptors" title="Toronto Raptors">Toronto Raptors</a>, Bryant recorded his 20th career triple-double with 31 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds. At age 36, he became the oldest NBA player to ever achieve 30 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists in a game. On December 14, Bryant became the NBA&apos;s third <a href="/wiki/List_of_National_Basketball_Association_career_scoring_leaders" title="List of National Basketball Association career scoring leaders">all-time leading scorer</a>, passing Jordan (32,292) in a 100&#x2013;94 win against Minnesota. He played in the first 27 games of the season, averaging team-highs with 26.4 points and 35.4 minutes per game while leading the league with 22.4 shots per game. However, Scott held him out for three straight games to rest after one of his worst performances of the season, when Bryant committed nine turnovers and scored 25 points on just 8-for-30 shooting in a 108&#x2013;101 loss to Sacramento. He was suffering from soreness in his knees, feet, back, and Achilles tendons, and Scott planned to reduce his workload going forward. Three times Bryant had exceeded 40 minutes in a game, and the coach blamed himself for overloading him after he started the season in such great shape. For the season, Bryant had been shooting just 37 percent from the field, and the team&apos;s record was only 8&#x2013;19. In his second game back after resting, he had 23 points, 11 assists, and 11 rebounds in a 111&#x2013;103 win over Denver, and became just the third player in league history to record multiple triple-doubles in a season at age 36 or older. On January 21, 2015, Bryant suffered a <a href="/wiki/Rotator_cuff_tear" title="Rotator cuff tear">rotator cuff tear</a> in his right shoulder while driving baseline for a two-handed dunk against the <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans_Pelicans" title="New Orleans Pelicans">New Orleans Pelicans</a>. Though he is a right-handed, he returned to play in the game and ran the offense while shooting, dribbling, and passing almost exclusively with his left hand. Prior to the injury, Bryant had been rested in 8 of 16 games. He underwent season-ending surgery for the injury, finishing the season averaging 22.3 points but shooting a career-low 37.3 percent, well below his 45.4 percent career mark to start the season. He was expected to be sidelined for nine months with a return targeted toward the start of the 2015&#x2013;16 season.</p>

Bryant scored just four points in 25 minutes on 1-for-14 shooting, matching the worst-shooting game of his career in which he attempted at least five shots.

Bryant against Washington after his retirement announcement</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>On November 29, 2015, Bryant announced via <i><a href="/wiki/The_Players%27_Tribune" title="The Players&apos; Tribune">The Players&apos; Tribune</a></i> that he will be retiring at the end of the season. In his poem titled &quot;Dear Basketball&quot;, Bryant wrote that he fell in love with the game at age six; &quot;A love so deep I gave you my all/From my mind &amp; body/To my spirit &amp; soul.&quot; The 2015&#x2013;16 season &quot;is all I have left to give./My heart can take the pounding/My mind can handle the grind/But my body knows it&#x2019;s time to say goodbye./And that&#x2019;s OK./I&#x2019;m ready to let you go.&quot; In a letter distributed to Lakers&apos; fans before that evening&apos;s game against the <a href="/wiki/Indiana_Pacers" title="Indiana Pacers">Indiana Pacers</a>, Bryant wrote, &quot;What you&apos;ve done for me is far greater than anything I&apos;ve done for you. ... My love for this city, this team and for each of you will never fade. Thank you for this incredible journey.&quot;</p>
<p>At the time of his announcement, he was second on the team in minutes (30.8) behind <a href="/wiki/Jordan_Clarkson" title="Jordan Clarkson">Jordan Clarkson</a> and leading the team with 16.7 field goal attempts per game, while averaging just 15.7 points and shooting a career-low 31.5 percent. His free throw attempts had dropped from his career average, and his game had become over-reliant on <a href="/wiki/Pump_fake" title="Pump fake">pump fakes</a> and long-range shots, making a league-worst 19.5 percent from three-point range while attempting seven a game, almost double his career average.

</div>
</div>
<p>Bryant requested that opposing teams on the road not hold any on-court ceremonies in his honor or present him any gifts in public. Prior to announcing his retirement, he had been steadfast about not wanting the fuss of a staged farewell tour, preferring to hear boos instead of cheers. Still, he was honored around the league with video tributes, and fans greeted him with ovations, even at arenas that historically jeered him like <a href="/wiki/TD_Garden" title="TD Garden">TD Garden</a> in Boston and <a href="/wiki/Sleep_Train_Arena" title="Sleep Train Arena">Sleep Train Arena</a> in Sacramento. Previously, Bryant was respected but not beloved, and he was astonished at the cheers he was now receiving.</p>
<p>On February 3, Bryant made seven three-pointers and scored a season-high 38 points, including 14 of the team&apos;s 18 points in the last 5:02 of the game, for a 119&#x2013;115 win over Minnesota. The win ended a 10-game losing streak, and the Lakers averted establishing the longest losing streak in franchise history. Bryant became just the fourth NBA player over 37 years old to log at least 35 points, five rebounds, and five assists in a game. Bryant was the leading overall vote-getter for the <a href="/wiki/2016_NBA_All-Star_Game" title="2016 NBA All-Star Game">2016 All-Star Game</a> with 1.9 million votes, ahead of <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Curry" title="Stephen Curry">Stephen Curry</a>&apos;s 1.6 million. Having moved to <a href="/wiki/Small_forward" title="Small forward">small forward</a> that season, Bryant was selected as a frontcourt starter for the first time. Playing in his first All-Star game since 2013, Bryant had 10 points, six rebounds, and seven assists. West teammates offered to feed him the ball in an attempt to get him another All-Star MVP, but he declined.</p>
<p>On April 13, 2016, Bryant played his final NBA game against the <a href="/wiki/Utah_Jazz" title="Utah Jazz">Utah Jazz</a>, scoring a season-high 60 points (the most points scored by a player that season), including outscoring the entire Jazz team 23&#x2013;21 in the fourth quarter, in the Lakers&apos; 101&#x2013;96 victory.</p>

<p>Standing at 6 feet 6 inches tall (1.98 m) and weighing 205 pounds (93&#xA0;kg), Bryant primarily plays as a <a href="/wiki/Shooting_guard" title="Shooting guard">shooting guard</a>. Able to create a decent shot at any time, he is often cited as one of the most dangerous scorers in the NBA. Bryant has drawn frequent comparisons to Jordan, after whom he modeled his playing style. Like Jordan, he became most known shooting a <a href="/wiki/Fall-away_(basketball)" class="mw-redirect" title="Fall-away (basketball)">fall-away jump shot</a>. Chris Ballard of <i>Sports Illustrated</i> describes another of Bryant&apos;s most famous moves as the &quot;jab step-and-pause&quot;: Bryant jabs his non-<a href="/wiki/Pivot_foot" class="mw-redirect" title="Pivot foot">pivot foot</a> forward to let the defender relax and instead of bringing the jab foot back, pushing off it and driving around his opponent to get to the basket.</p>
<p>Bryant established a reputation for taking shots in the closing moments of tight games, even amid <a href="/wiki/Double_team" title="Double team">double</a> or triple teams, and has been noted as being one of the premier closers in the NBA. In an annual survey of NBA general managers, he was selected in 2012 for the 10th consecutive season as the player they most wanted taking the shot with the game on the line. Bryant enjoys being the villain, and revels in being booed and silencing the crowd with his play. His ability to make difficult shots has also drawn criticism of his shot selection. Throughout his career, he has been disparaged for being a selfish high-volume shooter; he has missed more field goal attempts in his career than any other player in NBA history. Phil Jackson states that Bryant &quot;tends to force the action, especially when the game isn&apos;t going his way. When his shot is off, Kobe will pound away relentlessly until his luck turns.&quot; According to Bryant, &quot;I would go 0 for 30 before I would go 0 for 9; 0 for 9 means you beat yourself, you psyched yourself out of the game.&quot;</p>
<p>Aside from his abilities on offense, he has established himself as a standout defender. Bryant rarely draws <a href="/wiki/Charge_(basketball)" class="mw-redirect" title="Charge (basketball)">charges</a> playing defense, which he believes has spared his body and contributed to his longevity. Some critics have suggested that the defensive accolades in his later years were earned more on his reputation than his actual play. His role with the Lakers became more focused on offense and conserving his energy for the playoffs, and <a href="/wiki/Metta_World_Peace" title="Metta World Peace">Metta World Peace</a> assumed the responsibility of guarding the opponent&apos;s top player on the <a href="/wiki/Wing_(basketball)" class="mw-redirect" title="Wing (basketball)">wing</a>.</p>
<p>Bryant is also lauded for his work ethic. Through his first 16 seasons, his body was resilient, and he exhibited a high <a href="/wiki/Pain_threshold" class="mw-redirect" title="Pain threshold">pain threshold</a> while often playing through injuries. A fierce competitor, opponents and teammates alike have been the object of his scorn. Many players have considered him difficult to play with because of his high level of commitment and performance. According to sportswriter Mark Heisler of <i><a href="/wiki/Forbes" title="Forbes">Forbes</a></i>, &quot;circa 2004&#x2013;2007, Kobe was the most alienated superstar the NBA had ever seen.&quot; He did, however, lead the Lakers to two championships post-O&apos;Neal while becoming more of a mentor to his teammates. Bryant&apos;s longtime head coach <a href="/wiki/Phil_Jackson" title="Phil Jackson">Phil Jackson</a> noted that the biggest difference during his second tenure in coaching the Lakers was that &quot;[Bryant] embraced the team and his teammates, calling them up when we were on the road and inviting them out to dinner. It was as if the other players were now his partners, not his personal spear-carriers.&quot;</p>

<p>Bryant was called &quot;one of the greatest players in the history of our game&quot; by NBA commissioner <a href="/wiki/Adam_Silver" title="Adam Silver">Adam Silver</a>, and <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> wrote that he has had &quot;one of the most decorated careers in the history of the sport.&quot; <a href="/wiki/Reuters" title="Reuters">Reuters</a> called him &quot;arguably the best player of his generation&quot;, while both <i><a href="/wiki/Sporting_News" title="Sporting News">Sporting News</a></i> and <a href="/wiki/TNT_(TV_channel)" title="TNT (TV channel)">TNT</a> named him their NBA player of the decade for the 2000s.

He is the Lakers&apos; all-time leading scorer, and his five titles are tied for the most in franchise history.</p>
<p>With career averages of 25.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, 4.7 assists, and 1.4 steals per game, he is considered one of the most complete players in NBA history. He was the first player in NBA history to have at least 30,000 career points and 6,000 career assists, and is one of only four players with 25,000 points, 6,000 rebounds and 6,000 assists.

His 81-point performance against Toronto in 2006 was the second-highest in NBA history, behind only Chamberlain&apos;s 100. He has scored at least 50 points 24 times in his career, which is third in league history behind Jordan (31) and Chamberlain (118); six times Bryant scored at least 60. He was just the third player in NBA history to average 40 points in a calendar month, which he has accomplished four times. Bryant was voted the league MVP in 2008 and led his team to the <a href="/wiki/2008_NBA_Finals" title="2008 NBA Finals">2008 NBA Finals</a> as the first seed in the Western Conference.

<p>In November 1999, 21-year-old Bryant met 17-year-old Vanessa Laine while she was working as a background dancer on the <a href="/wiki/Tha_Eastsidaz" title="Tha Eastsidaz">Tha Eastsidaz</a> music video &quot;G&apos;d Up&quot;. Bryant was in the building working on <a href="#Music">his debut musical album</a>. The two began dating and became engaged just six months later in May 2000, while Laine was still a senior at <a href="/wiki/Marina_High_School_(Huntington_Beach,_California)" title="Marina High School (Huntington Beach, California)">Marina High School</a> in <a href="/wiki/Huntington_Beach,_California" title="Huntington Beach, California">Huntington Beach</a>, California. To avoid media scrutiny, she finished high school through independent study. According to Vanessa&apos;s cousin Laila Laine, there was no <a href="/wiki/Prenuptial_agreement" title="Prenuptial agreement">prenuptial agreement</a>. Vanessa said Bryant &quot;loved her too much for one&quot;.</p>
<p>They married on April 18, 2001, at St. Edward the Confessor Roman Catholic Church in <a href="/wiki/Dana_Point,_California" title="Dana Point, California">Dana Point</a>, California. The wedding was not attended by Bryant&apos;s parents, his two sisters, his longtime advisor and agent Arn Tellem, or his Laker teammates. Bryant&apos;s parents were opposed to the marriage for a number of reasons. Reportedly Bryant&apos;s parents had problems with him marrying so young, especially to a woman who was not African-American. This disagreement resulted in an estrangement period of over two years, which ended when the couple&apos;s first daughter was born.</p>
<p>In 2013, Bryant had a legal disagreement with an <a href="/wiki/Auction" title="Auction">auction</a> house over memorabilia from his early years that his mother intended to auction. Pamela Bryant received $450,000 from the auction house for the items, and claimed Bryant had given her the rights to the items he had remaining in her home. However, his lawyers asked the auction house to return the items to Bryant. Before the scheduled trial, a settlement was reached allowing the sale of less than 10% of the original items. Bryant&apos;s parents apologized to him in a written statement, which also acknowledged the financial support Bryant had provided them in the past.</p>
<p>In January 2002, Bryant bought a <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_Revival_architecture" title="Mediterranean Revival architecture">Mediterranean-style</a> house for $4&#xA0;million, located on a <a href="/wiki/Cul-de-sac" title="Cul-de-sac">cul-de-sac</a> in <a href="/wiki/Newport_Coast,_Newport_Beach" title="Newport Coast, Newport Beach">Newport Coast, Newport Beach</a>, which sold in May 2015.</p>
<p>The Bryants&apos; first child, a daughter named Natalia Diamante Bryant, was born in 2003. The birth of Natalia influenced Bryant to reconcile his differences with his parents. Vanessa Bryant suffered a <a href="/wiki/Miscarriage" title="Miscarriage">miscarriage</a> due to an <a href="/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy" title="Ectopic pregnancy">ectopic pregnancy</a> in the spring of 2005. Their second daughter, Gianna Maria-Onore Bryant, was born in 2006. On December 16, 2011, Vanessa Bryant filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences, and the couple requested joint custody of their daughters. On January 11, 2013, Bryant and his wife both announced via <a href="/wiki/Social_media" title="Social media">social media</a> that they had called off their divorce.</p>
<p>In an early 2007 interview, it was revealed that Bryant still speaks Italian fluently. He has also conducted press interviews in Spanish. Bryant assigned himself the nickname of &quot;Black Mamba&quot;, citing a desire for his basketball skills to mimic the <a href="/wiki/Black_mamba" title="Black mamba">eponymous snake</a>&apos;s ability to &quot;strike with 99% accuracy at maximum speed, in rapid succession.&quot; During the 2012&#x2013;13 season, he began referring to himself as &quot;vino&quot; to describe how his play had been <a href="/wiki/Aging_of_wine" title="Aging of wine">aging like a fine wine</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sexual_assault_allegation">Sexual assault allegation</span></h3>

<p>In the summer of 2003, the sheriff&apos;s office of <a href="/wiki/Eagle,_Colorado" title="Eagle, Colorado">Eagle, Colorado</a>, arrested Bryant in connection with an investigation of a <a href="/wiki/Sexual_assault" title="Sexual assault">sexual assault</a> complaint filed by a 19-year-old hotel employee. Bryant had checked into The Lodge and Spa at Cordillera in Eagle County in advance of undergoing knee surgery nearby. The accuser stated that Bryant raped her in his hotel room the night before Bryant was to have the procedure. Bryant admitted to an <a href="/wiki/Adultery" title="Adultery">adulterous sexual encounter</a> with his accuser, but denied her sexual assault allegation. In his interview with police, Bryant also acknowledged a &quot;frequent&quot; adulterous sexual relationship with another woman named &quot;Michelle&quot; at the time.</p>
<p>The accusation tarnished Bryant&apos;s reputation, as the public&apos;s perception of Bryant plummeted, and his endorsement contracts with <a href="/wiki/McDonald%27s" title="McDonald&apos;s">McDonald&apos;s</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nutella" title="Nutella">Nutella</a> were terminated. Sales for Bryant&apos;s replica jersey fell significantly from their previous highs. However, in September 2004, the assault case was dropped by prosecutors after the accuser refused to testify in the trial. Afterward, Bryant agreed to apologize to her for the incident, including his public <a href="/wiki/Mea_culpa" title="Mea culpa">mea culpa</a>: &quot;Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.&quot; The accuser filed a separate civil lawsuit against Bryant, which the two sides ultimately settled with the specific terms of the settlement being undisclosed to the public.</p>

His first signature shoe was the Equipment KB 8. Bryant&apos;s other earlier endorsements included deals with <a href="/wiki/The_Coca-Cola_Company" title="The Coca-Cola Company">The Coca-Cola Company</a> to endorse their <a href="/wiki/Sprite_(soft_drink)" title="Sprite (soft drink)">Sprite</a> soft drink, appearing in advertisements for <a href="/wiki/McDonald%27s" title="McDonald&apos;s">McDonald&apos;s</a>, promoting <a href="/wiki/Spalding_(sports_equipment)" title="Spalding (sports equipment)">Spalding</a>&apos;s new NBA Infusion Ball, <a href="/wiki/Upper_Deck_Company" title="Upper Deck Company">Upper Deck</a>, Italian chocolate company <a href="/wiki/Ferrero_SpA" title="Ferrero SpA">Ferrero SpA</a>&apos;s brand <a href="/wiki/Nutella" title="Nutella">Nutella</a>, <a href="/wiki/Russell_Corporation" class="mw-redirect" title="Russell Corporation">Russell Corporation</a>, and appearing on his own series of video games by <a href="/wiki/Nintendo" title="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>. Many companies like McDonald&apos;s and Ferrero SpA terminated his contracts when rape allegations against him became public. A notable exception was <a href="/wiki/Nike,_Inc." title="Nike, Inc.">Nike, Inc.</a>, who had signed him to a five-year, $40&#x2013;45&#xA0;million contract just before the incident. However, they refused to use his image or market a new shoe of his for the year, but eventually did start promoting Bryant once his image recovered 2 years later. He has since resumed endorsement deals with <a href="/wiki/The_Coca-Cola_Company" title="The Coca-Cola Company">The Coca-Cola Company</a>, through their subsidiary <a href="/wiki/Energy_Brands" title="Energy Brands">Energy Brands</a> to promote their Vitamin Water brand of drinks.

<p>In a 2008 video promoting Nike&apos;s Hyperdunk shoes, Bryant appears to jump over a speeding <a href="/wiki/Aston_Martin" title="Aston Martin">Aston Martin</a>. The stunt was considered to be fake, and the <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a> said a real stunt would probably be a violation of Bryant&apos;s Lakers contract. After promoting Nike&apos;s Hyperdunk shoes, Bryant came out with the fourth edition of his signature line by Nike, the Zoom Kobe IV. In 2010 Nike launched another shoe, Nike Zoom Kobe V. In 2009, Bryant signed a deal with Nubeo to market the &quot;Black Mamba collection&quot;, a line of sports/luxury watches that range from $25,000 to $285,000. On February 9, 2009, Bryant was featured on the cover of <a href="/wiki/ESPN_The_Magazine" title="ESPN The Magazine">ESPN <i>The Magazine</i></a>. However, it was not for anything basketball related, rather it was about Bryant being a big fan of <a href="/wiki/FC_Barcelona" title="FC Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a>. <a href="/wiki/CNN" title="CNN">CNN</a> estimated Bryant&apos;s endorsement deals in 2007 to be worth $16&#xA0;million a year.

The deal involved Bryant being in a promotional film to be aired in over 80 countries in addition to his being used in digital, print and billboard advertising.</p>
<p>Bryant has appeared as the cover athlete for the following video games:</p>

<p>In September 2012, Bryant shot a commercial for <a href="/wiki/Turkish_Airlines" title="Turkish Airlines">Turkish Airlines</a> with <a href="/wiki/FC_Barcelona" title="FC Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a> star <a href="/wiki/Lionel_Messi" title="Lionel Messi">Lionel Messi</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Music">Music</span></h3>
<p>In high school, Bryant was a member of a <a href="/wiki/Rapping" title="Rapping">rap</a> group called CHEIZAW, named after the Chi Sah gang in the martial arts film <i><a href="/wiki/Kid_with_the_Golden_Arm" title="Kid with the Golden Arm">Kid with the Golden Arm</a></i>. The group was signed by <a href="/wiki/Sony_Entertainment" class="mw-redirect" title="Sony Entertainment">Sony Entertainment</a>, but the company&apos;s ultimate goal was to eliminate the group and have Bryant record on his own. The label wanted to capitalize on Bryant&apos;s youth and NBA fame. He performed at a 1997 concert by <a href="/wiki/Sway_%26_King_Tech" title="Sway &amp; King Tech">Sway &amp; King Tech</a> and recorded a verse for a remix of <a href="/wiki/Brian_McKnight" title="Brian McKnight">Brian McKnight</a>&apos;s &quot;Hold Me&quot;. Bryant even appeared on Lakers teammate O&apos;Neal&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/Respect_(Shaquille_O%27Neal_album)" title="Respect (Shaquille O&apos;Neal album)">Respect</a></i>, starting the track &quot;3 X&apos;s Dope&quot;, though Bryant&apos;s name was not listed on the credits.</p>
<p>Sony pushed Bryant from his roots of <a href="/wiki/Underground_hip_hop" title="Underground hip hop">underground hip hop</a> into a more radio-friendly sound. His debut album, <i>Visions</i>, was scheduled to release in the spring of 2000. The first single, &quot;K.O.B.E&apos;&quot;, featured supermodel <a href="/wiki/Tyra_Banks" title="Tyra Banks">Tyra Banks</a> singing the <a href="/wiki/Hook_(music)" title="Hook (music)">hook</a>. The single debuted in January 2000, and was performed at NBA All-Star Weekend that month; the song was not well received. Sony abandoned plans for the album, which was never released, and dropped Bryant later that year. The Sony president who originally signed Bryant had already left, and Bryant&apos;s other backers had mostly abandoned him.
