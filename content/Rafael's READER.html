			<h1>ON ARRANGED CHAOS</h1>
			<p>A research on the legibility of 10 good legible typefaces. They individually exist in their own structure of rules and grids. By creating a system for every type family that distorts the existing one, new forms and shapes are created.

			<h1>ON THE COUNCIL FOR CULTURE</h1>
			<p>
				The Council for Culture is the legal adviser of the government in the fields of art, culture and media. <br><br>

				The Blue Room functions as an office and meeting space, where decisions and conversations take place. The sound created by a discussion in the room influences a projection of thin animated white lines on the wall gradually forming various types of cinematographic grids referring to the focus of the Council for Culture: choice, structure, anticipation, devision, method, trends, recommendation, etc. <br><br>

				The specification of the grid can be addapted according to the different occasions - meetings, events, presentations. <br>

			<h1>ON THE UTOPIAN ROUTINE</h1>
			<p>
			An utopia based on our daily routines. The utopian island acts as a digital layer on top of the physical world we live in. The utopia consist of an app, a set of jewelry, a flag/scarf and a model of the architectural world. <br><br>

			Together with D&#xE9;bora Marquesi &amp; Amir Houieh we created the app. The app serves as a depository of the various acts and events. Within the interaction between user and the app, user will receive a randomly chosen action to do or event to particitate in. This will create a connection between digital and the utopian world and make a move in a direction of breaking the daily routines. <br><br>

			The set of jewellery represents a system of insular signs. Both the jewellery and the scarf (that can also be used as flag), show the physical presence of the inhabitant of the utopian island. <br><br>

			The maquette represents the ideal architectural world where randomly generated doors are mapped out on the circles. Once two doors connect the pass trough becomes possible, which directs a travelling routine into a randomly generated process.

			<h1>ON WASTE</h1>
			<p>
				This publication compares ways of dealing with waste in the physical and digital space. How messy are we with the digital data? Can we use the methods of waste managment that we use in a physical space be used for the digital world as well?  <br><br>

				By researching my own waste production I give a perspective on how both the physical and digital worlds are interconnected.

			<h1>ON HAPPINESS</h1>
			<p>
				People often do not express themselves enough when it comes to happiness. The movement of jumping and hopping is no longer an expression of happiness for an adult. By focussing on the movement and gestures while hopping I created a model that functions as a poster that mimics this movement and at the same time creates a smile. On the series of photographs I focus on the static movement and recognition of the jumping. The video represents a manual existing of an army of happy people and questions if such an army is something we want.

            <h1>ON SHAPES</h1>
			<p>
				A process is a research on 2D and 3D shapes and forms and its interpretations. The concept is based on the idea of a process itself, a process that is changing in a linear way.<br> <br>

				The video shows four perspectives on a process. It illustrates different points of view and choices that can be made in the process of a project.  <br> <br>
