Meanwhile the rest of the undercard was not as well received.</p><p>James Caldwell of <i><a href="/wiki/Pro_Wrestling_Torch" class="mw-redirect" title="Pro Wrestling Torch">Pro Wrestling Torch</a></i> reviewed most of the event&apos;s matches, giving the Reigns-Rollins world title match 3.5 (out of 5) stars due to a &quot;very strong second-half after a sluggish first-half with Reigns playing a heel throughout.&quot; Caldwell attributed Ambrose&apos;s title win to WWE needing to &quot;to do something after the 2.03 TV rating on Monday&quot; for <i>Raw</i>, leading to &quot;WWE switching the belt the one clear, 100 percent, Daniel Bryan-like babyface they have at the top of the card&quot;. Two of the event&apos;s matches were jointly best rated at 3.75 stars: Cena-Styles, &quot;three-fourths of the way to an epic match that was hyped going into the PPV&quot; but &quot;Cena looked rusty&quot;; as well as the ladder match, &quot;very good&quot; but with a predictable ending &quot;since everyone got their shine while Ambrose was mainly in the background during the match&quot;. The rest of the matches on the pay-per-view broadcast were rated between 2.0 and 2.5 stars: the tag title match was &quot;a bit of a mess&quot;; &quot;Ziggler made [Corbin] look good&quot;; Lynch and Natalya should have gotten a &quot;credibility-boosting victory since they always lose to Charlotte&quot;; Crews&apos;s win was &quot;unconvincing&quot;, and Rusev was repeating his 2014 storyline with the U.S. title.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Dave_Meltzer" title="Dave Meltzer">Dave Meltzer</a> of the <i>Wrestling Observer</i> deemed the first pre-show match a &quot;nothing match&quot; and the second pre-show match &quot;normal&quot;. He opined that the tag title match drew the crowd into it but that the &quot;execution was rough&quot;. Meltzer was negative on Corbin-Ziggler, which he called &quot;too long&quot;, as the &quot;feud has done Ziggler no favors&quot; while &quot;Corbin just doesn&apos;t show much of anything&quot;. The finish of Crews-Sheamus made him think &quot;it&apos;s just the beginning between these two.&quot; The next two matches Meltzer deemed &quot;excellent&quot;: Cena-Styles was about Styles being &quot;the better wrestler than Cena, beating him at every turn but he couldn&apos;t finish him&quot;, while in the ladder match everyone (especially Cesaro) &quot;took big ladder bumps but there was nothing really insane like used to be in such matches. Meltzer wrote the U.S. title match &quot;was in the death spot&quot; and &quot;really had no chance with the crowd&quot; despite Rusev and O&apos;Neil having &quot;worked hard in a physical match.&quot; The Reigns-Rollins match he called &quot;flat at times because it went so long&quot; and that Rollins was &quot;not that over as a face&quot; while &quot;people just weren&apos;t into Reigns at all&quot;.</p><p>Jason Namako of <i>Wrestleview</i> felt that Money in the Bank was &quot;a damn good show&quot; with a &quot;phenomenal ending&quot;: it featured &quot;the resurrection of Dean Ambrose as a player in this company and it was an amazing success&quot;. That followed the Reigns-Rollins world title match, which was Namako&apos;s match of the night. Ambrose was Namako&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Most_Valuable_Player" class="mw-redirect" title="Most Valuable Player">Most Valuable Player</a> of the night, with his &quot;insane&quot; ladder match featuring &quot;tremendous effort&quot; by all six men involved. Another notable match was the tag title match, a &quot;super-fun opener with a real hot, frenetic pace to it&quot;. Meanwhile, Corbin-Ziggler was &quot;solid&quot;, Crews-Sheamus was &quot;decent&quot;, and O&apos;Neil and Rusev &quot;did the best they could&quot; in the &quot;epitome of a cool-down match&quot;. However, Namako felt the show also had negatives: the &quot;masterful performance&quot; by Cena and Styles was &quot;tarnished by timid booking&quot; with an &quot;unneeded cheap finish&quot; which did not &quot;help Styles in the slightest&quot;; while the women&apos;s match was &quot;run-of-the-mill&quot; and &quot;it unfortunately looks like we are right back where we started one year ago before the &apos;Divas Revolution&apos; began&quot;.</p><p>Aaron Oster, writing for <i><a href="/wiki/The_Baltimore_Sun" title="The Baltimore Sun">The Baltimore Sun</a></i>, wrote that Ambrose&apos;s win of the ladder match was predictable, yet &quot;the main event was anything but predictable&quot;. Oster attributed the television overrun of the show to two reasons: firstly viewers who were watching the Game 7 of the NBA Finals could watch the main event, and secondly &quot;it kept fans guessing exactly when it would end&quot;. &quot;Hypothetically, if things go as the WWE wants with Brock Lesnar returning to UFC&quot;, Oster speculated, &quot;many more eyes than usual will be turning toward the company for the entire summer, and especially at Summerslam. To have Dean Ambrose be the champion when that is happening is a huge statement from the company that shows how much confidence that they have in him.&quot; For the other events, Oster felt it was &quot;weird&quot; to portray Crews as an &quot;underdog&quot; but that was still &quot;better than having absolutely no direction with him.&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;Rusev as a jerk heel, and not simply an anti-American heel, is really a fantastic thing.&quot; Oster also remarked that Golden Truth had fan support but doubted that WWE would &quot;actually go anywhere with it.&quot;</p><p>The day after Money in the Bank, Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins wrestled on <i>Raw</i> for a future shot at Dean Ambrose&apos;s world title. That match ended in a double count-out, so Ambrose agreed to face both men, and Shane McMahon arranged a triple threat world title match at <a href="/wiki/Battleground_(2016)" title="Battleground (2016)">Battleground</a>.
