<p>The cultural change in the United States during the 1970s that was experienced by the baby boomers is complex. The 1960s are remembered as a time of political protests, radical experimentation with new cultural experiences (the <a href="/wiki/Sexual_Revolution" class="mw-redirect" title="Sexual Revolution">Sexual Revolution</a>, <a href="/wiki/Happenings" class="mw-redirect" title="Happenings">happenings</a>, mainstream awareness of Eastern religions). The <a href="/wiki/Civil_Rights_Movement" class="mw-redirect" title="Civil Rights Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a> gave rebellious young people serious goals to work towards. Cultural experimentation was justified as being directed toward spiritual or intellectual enlightenment. The 1970s, in contrast, were a time of disillusionment with idealistic politics among the young, particularly after the resignation of <a href="/wiki/Richard_Nixon" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, the assassination of <a href="/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr." title="Martin Luther King, Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>, and the end of the <a href="/wiki/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>. Unapologetic <a href="/wiki/Hedonism" title="Hedonism">hedonism</a> became acceptable among the young, expressed in the <a href="/wiki/Disco" title="Disco">Disco</a> music popular at the time.</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>The new introspectiveness announced the demise of an established set of traditional faiths centred on work and the postponement of gratification, and the emergence of a consumption-oriented lifestyle ethic centred on lived experience and the immediacy of daily lifestyle choices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the mid-1970s, <a href="/wiki/Tom_Wolfe" title="Tom Wolfe">Tom Wolfe</a> and <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Lasch" title="Christopher Lasch">Christopher Lasch</a> were speaking out critically against the culture of narcissism. These criticisms were widely repeated throughout American popular media.</p>
<p>The development of a youth culture focusing so heavily on self-fulfillment was also perhaps a reaction against the traits that characterized the older generation, which had grown up during the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>. That generation had learned values associated with self-sacrifice. The deprivations of the Depression had taught that generation to work hard, save money and not spend it; to cherish family and community ties. Loyalty to institutions, traditional religious faiths, and other common bonds were what that generation considered to be the cultural foundations of their country. Baby boomers gradually abandoned those values in large numbers, a development that was entrenched during the 1970s.</p>

Discos and nightclubbing became popular with Me generation singles during the 1970s.</div>

<p>Health and exercise fads, <a href="/wiki/New_Age" title="New Age">New Age</a> spirituality, <a href="/wiki/Disco" title="Disco">discos</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hot_tub" title="Hot tub">hot tub</a> parties, <a href="/wiki/Self-help" title="Self-help">self-help</a> programs such as EST (<a href="/wiki/Erhard_Seminars_Training" title="Erhard Seminars Training">Erhard Seminars Training</a>), and the growth of the self-help book industry became identified with the baby boomers during the 1970s. The marketing of lifestyle products, eagerly consumed by baby boomers with <a href="/wiki/Disposable_income" class="mw-redirect" title="Disposable income">disposable income</a> during the 1970s, became an inescapable part of the culture. Revlon&apos;s marketing staff did research into young women&apos;s cultural values during the 1970s, and the research revealed that young women were striving to compete with men in the workplace and to express themselves as independent individuals. Revlon launched the &quot;lifestyle&quot; perfume <i>Charlie</i>, with marketing aimed at glamorizing the values of the new 1970s woman, and it became the world&apos;s best-selling perfume.</p>
<p>The introspection of baby boomers and their focus on self-fulfillment has been examined in a serious light in pop culture. Films such as <i><a href="/wiki/An_Unmarried_Woman" title="An Unmarried Woman">An Unmarried Woman</a></i> (1978), <i><a href="/wiki/Kramer_vs._Kramer" title="Kramer vs. Kramer">Kramer vs. Kramer</a></i> (1979), <i><a href="/wiki/Ordinary_People" title="Ordinary People">Ordinary People</a></i> (1980) and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Big_Chill_(film)" title="The Big Chill (film)">The Big Chill</a></i> (1983) brought the inner struggles of baby boomers to a wide audience. The self-absorbed side of 1970s life was given a sharp and sometimes poignant satirization in <i><a href="/wiki/Manhattan_(film)" title="Manhattan (film)">Manhattan</a></i> (1979). More acerbic lampooning came in <i><a href="/wiki/Shampoo" title="Shampoo">Shampoo</a></i> (1975) and <i><a href="/wiki/Private_Benjamin_(1980_film)" title="Private Benjamin (1980 film)">Private Benjamin</a></i> (1980). The Me generation has also been satirized in retrospect, as the generation called &quot;<a href="/wiki/Generation_X" title="Generation X">Generation X</a>&quot; reached adulthood, for example, in <i><a href="/wiki/Parenthood_(film)" title="Parenthood (film)">Parenthood</a></i> (1989). <i><a href="/wiki/Forrest_Gump" title="Forrest Gump">Forrest Gump</a></i> (1994) summed up the decade with Gump&apos;s cross-country <a href="/wiki/Jogging" title="Jogging">jogging</a> quest for meaning during the 1970s, complete with a <a href="/wiki/Tracksuit" title="Tracksuit">tracksuit</a>, which was worn as much as a fashion statement as an athletic necessity during the era.</p>
<p>The satirization of the Me generation&apos;s me-first attitude perhaps reached its peak with the television sitcom <i><a href="/wiki/Seinfeld" title="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></i>, which did not include conscious moral development for its baby boomer characters, rather the opposite. Nor did it have plots with lessons to teach its audience. It was a &quot;show about nothing&quot;, and its creators held this position deliberately.</p>

The Me generation, for the most part, embrace entertainment and consumer culture.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The term &quot;Me generation&quot; has persisted over the decades, becoming synonymous with the baby boomers to many Americans. Not all young adults were enamored with the lifestyle choices being offered to them in mainstream culture, however. The 1970s were also an era of rising unemployment among the young, continuing erosion of faith in conventional social institutions, and political and ideological aimlessness for many. This was the environment that precipitated gravitation toward <a href="/wiki/Punk_rock" title="Punk rock">Punk rock</a> among America&apos;s disaffected young people. By 1980, when <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> was elected President, a growing number of America&apos;s baby boomers had also begun turning toward conservative political and cultural priorities.</p>
<p>At the same time, the realities behind the label have not escaped notice. As Eastern religions and rituals such as <a href="/wiki/Yoga" title="Yoga">yoga</a> grew during the 1970s, at least one writer observed a <a href="/wiki/New_Age" title="New Age">New Age</a> corruption of the popular understanding of &quot;realization&quot; taught by <a href="/wiki/Neo-Vedanta" title="Neo-Vedanta">Neo-Vedantic</a> practitioners, away from spiritual realization and towards &quot;self-realization&quot;. The leading edge of the baby boomers, who were <a href="/wiki/Counter-culture" class="mw-redirect" title="Counter-culture">counter-culture</a> &quot;<a href="/wiki/Hippies" class="mw-redirect" title="Hippies">hippies</a>&quot; and political activists during the 1960s, have been referred to sympathetically as the &quot;Now generation&quot;, in contrast to the Me generation.</p>
