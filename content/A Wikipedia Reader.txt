What follows is the documentation of 23 travels within Wikipedia (navigating from article to article via a connecting hyper-link, producing a string of connecting articles). The string of articles produced by each travel can be understood as a kind of mental-map: a wandering in thought, or a deeper continuous investigation. The decisions that each contributor made will hopefully produce not only an array of interesting subjects, but also serve as a kind of supplemental reader to their own creative practice. Presenting these links sequentially as they were traveled is also a kind of ordering method. To an extent, digital systems make hierarchical categorizing and analog ordering irrelevant (see introduction to A Wikipedia Reader, 2008). Information online is not necessarily categorized and ordered in the traditional sense, it is interconnected with everything, and accessed through these connections. Here the contributors themselves become the categories through their own choices of what connection to follow. The articles are abridged because of printing limitations. It must also be understood that each printed article is also a documentation in the article’s continuously growing life. That is the nature of user-generated content. Things are revised and updated. Some of the connections presented here may now be broken. Like old trolley lines, they belong to a different time. Yet unlike these old lines, they can be reconnected. Obviously, the nature of Web 2.0 opens up room for factual error. It also opens up room for tinkering and play, which was not present in the first reader. Oraib Toukan’s travel includes a fictitious article in between factual ones (this article lasted no longer than a day). It is a culture of participation. Even tricksters and trouble-makers can participate. But this tinkering is not always rooted in misinformation. When looking at the Hannah Arendt article (which came up twice through Marc Handelman and Eileen Quinlan), I had the uncanny realization that I was looking at my own hand in the photograph of her gravestone. I uploaded the photograph over a year before and had forgotten about it. I had thought, with it becoming more difficult to play with the text, why not play with the images? Anyone can assert their presence in the backgrounds and margins of photographs, becoming part of the information.
