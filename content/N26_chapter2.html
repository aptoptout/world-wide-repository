<p>That same month, Kardashian was involved in a lawsuit against one of her endorsements. Sanford Siegal, the creator of the <a href="/wiki/Cookie_diet" title="Cookie diet">Cookie Diet</a>, sued Kardashian, claiming she <a href="/wiki/Defamation" title="Defamation">defamed</a> him on Twitter. According to Siegal, Kardashian tweeted in October 2009 that he was &quot;falsely promoting&quot; that she was on the cookie diet. Siegal filed a claim in a Florida state court charging that her statements were false and defamatory. He also alleged that Kardashian was on QuickTrim&apos;s payroll when she posted the tweet. Kardashian&apos;s tweet appears to stem from an article on CookieDiet.com, that named Kardashian as one of many celebrities who saw positive results on the diet. Kardashian sent a <a href="/wiki/Cease-and-desist" class="mw-redirect" title="Cease-and-desist">cease-and-desist</a> order to Siegal, demanding the link be removed.</p>

The show followed them as they settle into their new offices in Los Angeles. That month, she also appeared on <a href="/wiki/The_Apprentice_(U.S._season_10)#Episode_9:_Fragrant_Disregard" title="The Apprentice (U.S. season 10)">season ten</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Apprentice_(U.S._TV_series)" title="The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)">The Apprentice</a></i>. Kim, Kourtney, and Khlo&#xE9; wrote an autobiography titled <i>Kardashian Konfidential</i>, which was released in stores on November 23, and appeared on <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_Times" class="mw-redirect" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">&apos;</span>s <a href="/wiki/New_York_Times_Best_Seller_List" class="mw-redirect" title="New York Times Best Seller List">Best Seller List</a>.

The song was produced by <a href="/wiki/The-Dream" title="The-Dream">The-Dream</a> and <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Stewart_(music_producer)" class="mw-redirect" title="Christopher Stewart (music producer)">Tricky Stewart</a>. When asked if an album was in the works, Kardashian replied, &quot;There&apos;s no album in the works or anything&#x2014;just one song we did for <i>Kourtney and Kim Take New York</i>, and a video Hype Williams directed, half of the proceeds we&apos;re giving away to a cancer foundation, because The-Dream&apos;s and one of my parents passed away from cancer. It&apos;s just all having fun&#x2014;with a good cause&quot;. Jim Farber, writing for the <i><a href="/wiki/Daily_News_(New_York)" class="mw-redirect" title="Daily News (New York)">Daily News</a></i>, called the song a &quot;dead-brained piece of generic dance music, without a single distinguishing feature,&quot; and suggested that the single made Kardashian the &quot;worst singer in the reality TV universe.&quot; That month, the <a href="/wiki/International_Business_Times" title="International Business Times">International Business Times</a> reported that Kardashian&apos;s 2010 earnings were the highest among Hollywood-based reality stars, estimating them at $6&#xA0;million.</p>

<p>In April 2011, Kardashian released her third fragrance &quot;Gold&quot;. Also in 2011, she filed a $20 million lawsuit against <a href="/wiki/Old_Navy" title="Old Navy">Old Navy</a> and its parent company, <a href="/wiki/Gap_Inc." title="Gap Inc.">Gap Inc.</a> for right of publicity. Old Navy used actress/model <a href="/wiki/Melissa_Molinaro" title="Melissa Molinaro">Melissa Molinaro</a> in their Old Navy commercial featuring the actress singing and dancing. Kim Kardashian claimed that Old Navy used Molinaro as a look alike to Kim in order to promote their brand. Kim Kardashian was also seeking order to have the actress/model Molinaro banned from Old Navy commercials. The lawsuit never went to trial but a settlement was reached by use of a mediator in 2012; the exact settlement is unknown.</p>
<p>In May 2011, Kardashian became engaged to NBA player <a href="/wiki/Kris_Humphries" title="Kris Humphries">Kris Humphries</a>, then of the <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey_Nets" class="mw-redirect" title="New Jersey Nets">New Jersey Nets</a>, whom she had been dating since October 2010.

A two-part TV special showing the preparations and the wedding itself aired on <i>E!</i> in early October 2011, amidst what <i><a href="/wiki/The_Washington_Post" title="The Washington Post">The Washington Post</a></i> called a &quot;media blitz&quot; related to the wedding.</p>
<p>After 72 days of marriage, she filed for divorce from Humphries on October 31, citing <a href="/wiki/Irreconcilable_differences" title="Irreconcilable differences">irreconcilable differences</a>. Several news outlets surmised that Kardashian&apos;s marriage to Humphries was merely a publicity stunt, to promote the Kardashian family&apos;s brand and their subsequent television ventures. A man professing to be her former publicist, Jonathan Jaxson, also claimed that her short-lived wedding was indeed staged and a ploy to generate money. Kardashian filed suit against Jaxson, saying his claims were untrue, and subsequently settled the case which included an apology from Jaxson. A widely circulated petition asking to remove all Kardashian-related programming from the air followed the split. The divorce would be subject to widespread media attention.</p>
<p>In March 2012, Kardashian debuted her fourth fragrance, titled &quot;True Reflection&quot;, which she worked with the company Dress for Success to promote. That month, Kardashian and her sisters were named in a $5 million <a href="/wiki/Class_action_lawsuit" class="mw-redirect" title="Class action lawsuit">class action lawsuit</a> against QuickTrim, the weight loss supplement they endorse. The complaint, filed in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_New_York" title="United States District Court for the Southern District of New York">United States District Court for the Southern District of New York</a>, accuses the Kardashians (along with QuickTrim&apos;s manufacturer, Windmill Health Products; the retailer GNC; and others in the sales and marketing chain) of false and deceptive marketing of the diet aid. The plaintiffs, hailing from several states, brought claims under their respective states&apos; <a href="/wiki/Consumer_protection_laws" class="mw-redirect" title="Consumer protection laws">consumer protection laws</a>. In April, <i>E!</i> renewed <i>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</i> for two additional seasons, in a deal reported to be worth $50 million.

Kardashian in September 2014</div>

</div>
<p>Kardashian appeared on the cover, and in a pictorial in <i><a href="/wiki/Paper_(magazine)" title="Paper (magazine)">Paper</a></i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">&apos;</span>s winter issue in 2014 photographed by <a href="/wiki/Jean-Paul_Goude" title="Jean-Paul Goude">Jean-Paul Goude</a>. On the cover, her nude buttocks are featured above the caption: &quot;Break the Internet&quot;, which generated considerable comment in both social and traditional media. The photos show Kardashian with her hair tied up in a bun, wearing only a pearl necklace, a pair of earrings and black satin gloves, and, on the cover, with her bare back facing the camera, holding a sequined gown below her bare, oiled-up buttocks, while smiling broadly at the camera. A <i>Time</i> magazine writer commented that, unlike previous celebrities&apos; nudes that represented the women&apos;s rebellion against repressed society and &quot;trying to tear down&quot; barriers, Kardashian&apos;s exhibition was &quot;just provocation and bluster, repeated images that seem to offer us some sort of truth or insight but are really just self serving. We want there to be something more, some reason or context, some great explanation that tells us what it is like to live in this very day and age, but there is not. Kim Kardashian&apos;s ass is nothing but an empty promise.&quot; However, the stunt &quot;set a new benchmark&quot; in social media response, and <i>Paper</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">&apos;</span>s website received 15.9 million views in one day, compared with 25,000 views on an average day.</p>
