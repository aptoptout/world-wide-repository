<p><b>Facebook</b> (stylized as <b>facebook</b>) is a for-profit <a href="/wiki/Corporation" title="Corporation">corporation</a> and online <a href="/wiki/Social_networking_service" title="Social networking service">social networking service</a> based in <a href="/wiki/Menlo_Park,_California" title="Menlo Park, California">Menlo Park, California</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>. Its website was launched on February 4, 2004 by <a href="/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg" title="Mark Zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a> with his <a href="/wiki/Harvard_College" title="Harvard College">Harvard College</a> roommates and fellow students <a href="/wiki/Eduardo_Saverin" title="Eduardo Saverin">Eduardo Saverin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Andrew_McCollum" title="Andrew McCollum">Andrew McCollum</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dustin_Moskovitz" title="Dustin Moskovitz">Dustin Moskovitz</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Chris_Hughes" title="Chris Hughes">Chris Hughes</a>. The founders had initially limited the website&apos;s membership to Harvard students, but later expanded it to <a href="/wiki/List_of_colleges_and_universities_in_metropolitan_Boston" title="List of colleges and universities in metropolitan Boston">higher education institutions in the Boston area</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Ivy_League" title="Ivy League">Ivy League</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Stanford_University" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</a>. It gradually added support for students at various other universities and later to high school students. Since 2006, anyone in general aged 13 and older has been allowed to become a registered user of the website, though variations exist in the minimum age requirement, depending on applicable local laws. Its name comes from the <a href="/wiki/Face_book" title="Face book">face book</a> directories often given to U.S. university students.</p>
<p>After registering to use the site, users can create a <a href="/wiki/User_profile" title="User profile">user profile</a>, add other users as <a href="/wiki/Friending" title="Friending">&quot;friends&quot;</a>, exchange messages, post status updates and photos, share videos, use various apps, and receive notifications when others update their profiles. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups organized by workplace, school, or other characteristics, and categorize their friends into lists such as &quot;People From Work&quot; or &quot;Close Friends&quot;. In groups editors can pin posts to top. Also, users can complain about or block unpleasant people. Because of the large volume of data that users submit to the service, Facebook has come under scrutiny for their privacy policies. Facebook, Inc. held its <a href="/wiki/Initial_public_offering" title="Initial public offering">initial public offering</a> in February 2012 and began selling <a href="/wiki/Stock" title="Stock">stock</a> to the public three months later, reaching an original peak <a href="/wiki/Market_capitalization" title="Market capitalization">market capitalization</a> of $104 billion.

<p>Zuckerberg wrote a program called <b>Facemash</b> on October 28, 2003 while attending <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> as a <a href="/wiki/Sophomore_year" class="mw-redirect" title="Sophomore year">sophomore</a> (second year student). According to <i><a href="/wiki/The_Harvard_Crimson" title="The Harvard Crimson">The Harvard Crimson</a></i>, the site was comparable to <a href="/wiki/Hot_or_Not" title="Hot or Not">Hot or Not</a> and used &quot;photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the &apos;hotter&apos; person&quot;</p>
<p>To accomplish this, Zuckerberg <a href="/wiki/Hacker_(computer_security)" title="Hacker (computer security)">hacked</a> into protected areas of Harvard&apos;s computer network and copied private dormitory <a href="/wiki/Identity_document" title="Identity document">ID</a> images. Harvard did not have a student &quot;<a href="/wiki/Facebook_(directory)" class="mw-redirect" title="Facebook (directory)">Facebook</a>&quot; (a directory with photos and basic information) at the time, although individual houses had been issuing their own paper facebooks since the mid-1980s, and Harvard&apos;s longtime Freshman Yearbook was colloquially referred to as the <b>&quot;Freshman Facebook&quot;</b>. Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours online.</p>
<p>The site was quickly forwarded to several campus group list-servers, but was shut down a few days later by the Harvard administration. Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was charged by the administration with breach of security, violating <a href="/wiki/Copyright" title="Copyright">copyrights</a>, and violating individual privacy. Ultimately, the charges were dropped. Zuckerberg expanded on this initial project that semester by creating a social study tool ahead of an <a href="/wiki/Art_history" title="Art history">art history</a> final exam. He uploaded 500 <a href="/wiki/History_of_Rome" title="History of Rome">Augustan</a> images to a website, each of which was featured with a corresponding comments section. He shared the site with his classmates, and people started sharing notes.</p>

<p>The following semester, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website in January 2004. He said that he was inspired by an editorial about the Facemash incident in <i>The Harvard Crimson</i>. On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched &quot;Thefacebook&quot;, originally located at thefacebook.com.</p>
<p>Six days after the site launched, Harvard seniors <a href="/wiki/Cameron_Winklevoss" title="Cameron Winklevoss">Cameron Winklevoss</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tyler_Winklevoss" title="Tyler Winklevoss">Tyler Winklevoss</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Divya_Narendra" title="Divya Narendra">Divya Narendra</a> accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing that he would help them build a social network called <b><a href="/wiki/ConnectU" title="ConnectU">HarvardConnection.com</a></b>. They claimed that he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product. The three complained to <i>The Harvard Crimson</i> and the newspaper began an investigation. They later filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg, subsequently settling in 2008 for 1.2 million <a href="/wiki/Shares" class="mw-redirect" title="Shares">shares</a> (worth $300 million at Facebook&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Initial_public_offering" title="Initial public offering">IPO</a>).</p>
<p>Membership was initially restricted to students of <a href="/wiki/Harvard_College" title="Harvard College">Harvard College</a>; within the first month, more than half the undergraduates at Harvard were registered on the service. <a href="/wiki/Eduardo_Saverin" title="Eduardo Saverin">Eduardo Saverin</a> (business aspects), Dustin Moskovitz (programmer), <a href="/wiki/Andrew_McCollum" title="Andrew McCollum">Andrew McCollum</a> (graphic artist), and <a href="/wiki/Chris_Hughes" title="Chris Hughes">Chris Hughes</a> joined Zuckerberg to help promote the website. In March 2004, Facebook expanded to the universities of <a href="/wiki/Columbia_University" title="Columbia University">Columbia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Stanford" class="mw-redirect" title="Stanford">Stanford</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Yale" class="mw-redirect" title="Yale">Yale</a>. It later opened to all <a href="/wiki/Ivy_League" title="Ivy League">Ivy League</a> colleges, <a href="/wiki/Boston_University" title="Boston University">Boston University</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York_University" title="New York University">New York University</a>, <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</a>, and gradually most universities in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>In mid-2004, entrepreneur <a href="/wiki/Sean_Parker" title="Sean Parker">Sean Parker</a> &#x2014; an informal advisor to Zuckerberg &#x2014; became the company&apos;s president. In June 2004, Facebook moved its operations base to <a href="/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California" title="Palo Alto, California">Palo Alto, California</a>. It received its first investment later that month from <a href="/wiki/PayPal" title="PayPal">PayPal</a> co-founder <a href="/wiki/Peter_Thiel" title="Peter Thiel">Peter Thiel</a>. In 2005, the company dropped &quot;the&quot; from its name after purchasing the <a href="/wiki/Domain_name" title="Domain name">domain name</a> <b>facebook.com</b> for <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" title="United States dollar">US$</a>200,000. The domain <b>facebook.com</b> belonged to AboutFace Corporation before the purchase. This website last appeared on April 8, 2005; from April 10, 2005 to August 4, 2005, this domain gave a 403 error.</p>

<p>In May 2005, <a href="/wiki/Accel_Partners" title="Accel Partners">Accel Partners</a> invested $12.7 million in Facebook, and <a href="/wiki/Jim_Breyer" title="Jim Breyer">Jim Breyer</a> added $1 million of his own money. A high-school version of the site was launched in September 2005, which Zuckerberg called the next logical step. (At the time, high-school networks required an invitation to join.) Facebook also expanded membership eligibility to employees of several companies, including <a href="/wiki/Apple_Inc." title="Apple Inc.">Apple Inc.</a> and Microsoft.</p>

<p>On September 26, 2006, Facebook was opened to everyone at least 13 years old with a valid <a href="/wiki/Email_address" title="Email address">email address</a>.</p>
<p>In late 2007, Facebook had 100,000 business pages (pages which allowed companies to promote themselves and attract customers). These started as group pages, but a new concept called company pages was planned. Pages began rolling out for businesses in May 2009.</p>
<p>On October 24, 2007, Microsoft announced that it had purchased a 1.6% share of Facebook for $240&#xA0;million, giving Facebook a total implied value of around $15&#xA0;billion. Microsoft&apos;s purchase included rights to place international advertisements on the social networking site.</p>
<p>In October 2008, Facebook announced that it would set up its international headquarters in <a href="/wiki/Dublin" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>, Ireland. Almost a year later, in September 2009, Facebook said that it had turned cash-flow positive for the first time.</p>
<p>A January 2009 <a href="/wiki/Compete.com" title="Compete.com">Compete.com</a> study ranked Facebook the most used social networking service by worldwide <a href="/wiki/Monthly_active_users" title="Monthly active users">monthly active users</a>. <i><a href="/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" title="Entertainment Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a></i> included the site on its end-of-the-decade &quot;best-of&quot; list saying, &quot;How on earth did we stalk our exes, remember our co-workers&apos; birthdays, bug our friends, and play a rousing game of <a href="/wiki/Lexulous" title="Lexulous">Scrabulous</a> before Facebook?&quot;</p>
<p>Traffic to Facebook increased steadily after 2009. The company announced 500 million users in July 2010 making it the largest online social network in the world at the time. According to the company&apos;s data, half of the site&apos;s membership use Facebook daily, for an average of 34 minutes, while 150 million users access the site by mobile. A company representative called the milestone a &quot;quiet revolution.&quot;</p>
<p>In November 2010, based on <a href="/wiki/SecondMarket" class="mw-redirect" title="SecondMarket">SecondMarket</a> Inc. (an exchange for privately held companies&apos; shares), Facebook&apos;s value was $41&#xA0;billion.

<p>In early 2011, Facebook announced plans to move its headquarters to the former <a href="/wiki/Sun_Microsystems" title="Sun Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a> campus in Menlo Park, California. In March 2011, it was reported that Facebook was removing approximately 20,000 profiles offline every day for violations such as spam, graphic content, and underage use, as part of its efforts to boost <a href="/wiki/Cyber_security" class="mw-redirect" title="Cyber security">cyber security</a>.</p>
<p>Release of statistics by <a href="/wiki/DoubleClick" title="DoubleClick">DoubleClick</a> showed that Facebook reached one trillion page views in the month of June 2011, making it the most visited website tracked by DoubleClick. According to a Nielsen Media Research study, released in December 2011, Facebook had become the second-most accessed website in the U.S. behind Google.</p>

<p>Facebook eventually filed for an <a href="/wiki/Initial_public_offering" title="Initial public offering">initial public offering</a> on February 1, 2012. Facebook <a href="/wiki/Initial_public_offering_of_Facebook" title="Initial public offering of Facebook">held an initial public offering</a> on May 17, 2012, negotiating a share price of US$38. The company was valued at $104 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly listed public company.</p>
<p>Facebook Inc. began selling stock to the public and trading on the <a href="/wiki/NASDAQ" title="NASDAQ">NASDAQ</a> on May 18, 2012. Based on its 2012 income of $5 billion, Facebook joined the <a href="/wiki/Fortune_500" title="Fortune 500">Fortune 500</a> list for the first time in May 2013, ranked in position 462.</p>
<p>Facebook filed their S1 document with the <a href="/wiki/Securities_and_Exchange_Commission" class="mw-redirect" title="Securities and Exchange Commission">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> on February 1, 2012. The company applied for a $5 billion IPO, one of the biggest offerings in the history of technology. The IPO raised $16 billion, making it the third-largest in U.S. history.</p>
<p>The shares began trading on May 18; the stock struggled to stay above the IPO price for most of the day, but set a record for the trading volume of an IPO (460 million shares). The first day of trading was marred by technical glitches that prevented orders from going through; only the technical problems and artificial support from underwriters prevented the stock price from falling below the IPO price on the day.</p>
<p>In March 2012, Facebook announced App Center, a store selling applications that operate via the site. The store was to be available on <a href="/wiki/IPhone" title="IPhone">iPhones</a>, <a href="/wiki/Android_(operating_system)" title="Android (operating system)">Android</a> devices, and mobile web users.</p>

<p>On May 22, 2012, the Yahoo! Finance website reported that Facebook&apos;s lead underwriters, <a href="/wiki/Morgan_Stanley" title="Morgan Stanley">Morgan Stanley</a> (MS), <a href="/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase" title="JPMorgan Chase">JP Morgan</a> (JPM), and <a href="/wiki/Goldman_Sachs" title="Goldman Sachs">Goldman Sachs</a> (GS), cut their earnings forecasts for the company in the middle of the IPO process. The stock had begun its freefall by this time, closing at 34.03 on May 21 and 31.00 on May 22. A <a href="/wiki/Trading_curb" title="Trading curb">&quot;circuit breaker&quot;</a> was used in an attempt to slow down the stock price&apos;s decline. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman <a href="/wiki/Mary_Schapiro" title="Mary Schapiro">Mary Schapiro</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Financial_Industry_Regulatory_Authority" title="Financial Industry Regulatory Authority">Financial Industry Regulatory Authority</a> (FINRA) Chairman Rick Ketchum, called for a review of the circumstances surrounding the IPO.</p>
<p>Facebook&apos;s IPO was consequently investigated, and was compared to a <a href="/wiki/Pump_and_dump" title="Pump and dump">pump and dump</a> scheme. A class-action lawsuit was filed in May 2012 because of the trading glitches, which led to botched orders. Lawsuits were filed, alleging that an underwriter for Morgan Stanley selectively revealed adjusted earnings estimates to preferred clients.</p>
<p>The other underwriters (MS, JPM, GS), Facebook&apos;s CEO and board, and NASDAQ also faced litigation after numerous lawsuits were filed, while SEC and FINRA both launched investigations. It was believed that adjustments to earnings estimates were communicated to the underwriters by a Facebook financial officer, who used the information to cash out on their positions while leaving the general public with overpriced shares. By the end of May 2012, Facebook&apos;s stock lost over a quarter of its starting value, which led the <i><a href="/wiki/Wall_Street_Journal" class="mw-redirect" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a></i> to label the IPO a &quot;fiasco&quot;.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg announced to the media at the start of October 2012 that Facebook had passed the monthly active users mark of one billion&#x2014;Facebook defines active users as a logged-in member who visits the site, or accesses it through a third-party site connected to Facebook, at least once a month. Fake accounts were not mentioned in the announcement, but the company continued to remove them after it found that 8.7% of its users were not real in August 2012. The company&apos;s data also revealed 600 million mobile users, 140 billion friend connections since the inception of Facebook, and the median age of a user as 22 years.</p>

<p>On January 15, 2013, Facebook announced <a href="/wiki/Facebook_Graph_Search" title="Facebook Graph Search">Facebook Graph Search</a>, which provides users with a &quot;precise answer,&quot; rather than a link to an answer by leveraging the data present on its site. Facebook emphasized that the feature would be &quot;privacy-aware,&quot; returning only results from content already shared with the user.</p>
<p>The company became the subject of a lawsuit by Rembrandt Social Media in February 2013, for patents involving the &quot;Like&quot; button. On April 3, 2013, Facebook unveiled <a href="/wiki/Facebook_Home" title="Facebook Home">Facebook Home</a>, a user-interface layer for Android devices offering greater integration with the site. <a href="/wiki/HTC" title="HTC">HTC</a> announced the <a href="/wiki/HTC_First" title="HTC First">HTC First</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Smartphone" title="Smartphone">smartphone</a> with Home pre-loaded.</p>
<p>On April 15, 2013, Facebook announced an alliance across 19 states with the National Association of Attorneys General, to provide teenagers and parents with information on tools to manage social networking profiles. On April 19, 2013, Facebook officially modified its logo to remove the faint blue line at the bottom of the &quot;F&quot; icon. The letter F moved closer to the edge of the box.</p>
<p>Following a campaign by 100 advocacy groups, Facebook agreed to update its policy on hate speech. The campaign highlighted content promoting domestic and sexual violence against women, and used over 57,000 tweets and more than 4,900 emails that caused withdrawal of advertising from the site by 15 companies, including Nissan UK, House of Burlesque and Nationwide UK. The social media website initially responded by stating that &quot;while it may be vulgar and offensive, distasteful content on its own does not violate our policies&quot;. It decided to take action on May 29, 2013, after it &quot;become clear that our systems to identify and remove hate speech have failed to work as effectively as we would like, particularly around issues of gender-based hate.&quot;</p>
<p>On June 12, 2013, Facebook announced on its newsroom that it was introducing clickable <a href="/wiki/Hashtag" title="Hashtag">hashtags</a> to help users follow trending discussions, or search what others are talking about on a topic. A July 2013 <i>Wall Street Journal</i> article identified the Facebook IPO as the cause of a change in the U.S.&apos; national economic statistics, as the local government area of the company&apos;s headquarters, <a href="/wiki/San_Mateo_County" class="mw-redirect" title="San Mateo County">San Mateo County</a>, California, became the top wage-earning county in the country after the fourth quarter of 2012. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the average weekly wage in the county was <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" title="United States dollar">US$</a>3,240, 107% higher than the previous year.

<p>A <a href="/wiki/Reuters" title="Reuters">Reuters</a> report, published on December 11, 2013, stated that <a href="/wiki/Standard_%26_Poor%27s" title="Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s">Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s</a> announced the placement of Facebook on its <a href="/wiki/S%26P_500" class="mw-redirect" title="S&amp;P 500">S&amp;P 500</a> index &quot;after the close of trading on December 20.&quot; Facebook announced Q4 2013 earnings of $523 million (20 cents per share), an increase of $64 million from the previous year, as well as 945 million mobile users.</p>
<p>By January 2014, Facebook&apos;s market capitalization had risen to over $134 billion. At the end of January 2014, 1.23 billion users were active on the website every month.</p>
<p>The company celebrated its 10th anniversary during the week of February 3, 2014. In each of the first three months of 2014, over one billion users logged into their Facebook account on a mobile device.</p>
<p>In February 2014, Facebook announced that it would be buying mobile messaging company Whatsapp for US$19 billion in cash and stock. In June 2014, Facebook announced the acquisition of Pryte, a Finnish mobile data-plan firm that aims to make it easier for mobile phone users in underdeveloped parts of the world to use wireless Internet apps.</p>
<p>At the start of July 2014, Facebook announced the acquisition of <a href="/w/index.php?title=LiveRail&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="LiveRail (page does not exist)">LiveRail</a>, a San Francisco, California-based online video advertising company.

As part of the company&apos;s second quarter results, Facebook announced in late July 2014 that mobile accounted for 62% of its advertising revenue, which is an increase of 21% from the previous year.</p>
<p>Alongside other American technology figures like <a href="/wiki/Jeff_Bezos" title="Jeff Bezos">Jeff Bezos</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tim_Cook" title="Tim Cook">Tim Cook</a>, Zuckerberg hosted visiting Chinese politician Lu Wei, known as the &quot;Internet czar&quot; for his influence in the enforcement of China&apos;s online policy, at Facebook&apos;s headquarters on December 8, 2014. The meeting occurred after Zuckerberg participated in a Q&amp;A session at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, on October 23, 2014, where he attempted to converse in Mandarin&#x2014;although Facebook is banned in China, Zuckerberg is highly regarded among the people and was at the university to help fuel the nation&apos;s burgeoning entrepreneur sector. A book of Chinese president Xi Xinping found on Zuckerberg&apos;s office desk attracted a great deal of attention in the media, after the Facebook founder explained to Lu, &quot;I want them [Facebook staff] to understand socialism with Chinese characteristics.&quot;</p>
<p>Zuckerberg fielded questions during a live Q&amp;A session at the company&apos;s headquarters in Menlo Park on December 11, 2014. The question of whether the platform would adopt a dislike button was raised again, and Zuckerberg said, &quot;We&apos;re [Facebook] thinking about it [dislike button] &#x2026; It&apos;s an interesting question,&quot; and said that he likes the idea of Facebook users being able to express a greater variety of emotions. In October 2015, Zuckerberg said that instead of creating a dislike button, Facebook is testing emoji reactions as an alternative to the &apos;like&apos; button. On February 24, 2016, Facebook launched <b>Facebook Reactions</b>, which allows users to respond to posts with multiple reactions in addition to &quot;liking&quot; it.</p>
<p>As of January 21, 2015, Facebook&apos;s algorithm is programmed to filter out false or misleading content, such as fake news stories and hoaxes, and will be supported by users who select the option to flag a story as &quot;purposefully fake or deceitful news.&quot; According to Reuters, such content is &quot;being spread like a wildfire&quot; on the social media platform. Facebook maintained that &quot;satirical&quot; content, &quot;intended to be humorous, or content that is clearly labeled as satire,&quot; will be taken into account and should not be intercepted. The algorithm, however, has been accused of maintaining a &quot;filter bubble&quot;, where both material the user disagrees with and posts with a low level of likes, will also not be seen. In 2015 November, Zuckerberg prolonged period of paternity leave from 4 weeks to 4 months.</p>
<p>On April 12, 2016, Zuckerberg revealed a decade-long plan for Facebook in a keynote address. His speech outlined his vision, which was centered around three main pillars: artificial intelligence, increased connectivity around the world and virtual and augmented reality. He also announced a new Facebook Messenger platform, which will have developers creating bots that are able to engage in automatic interactions with customers. In June 2016 Facebook announced Deep Text, a natural language processing AI which will learn user intent and context in 20 languages.</p>
<p>On May 31, 2016, Facebook, along with <a href="/wiki/Google" title="Google">Google</a>, <a href="/wiki/Microsoft" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter</a>, jointly agreed to a <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> code of conduct obligating them to review &quot;[the] majority of valid notifications for removal of illegal <a href="/wiki/Hate_speech" title="Hate speech">hate speech</a>&quot; posted on their services within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Facebook introduced 360-degree photo to posts on June 9, 2016. If one has a compatible <a href="/wiki/Samsung" title="Samsung">Samsung</a> phone, Facebook will display a dedicated &quot;view in VR&quot; button, then users will have to insert the phone into their Gear VR headsets to watch the photo in a more immersive style.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Revenue">Revenue</span></h3>

<p>Most of Facebook&apos;s revenue comes from advertising. Facebook generally has a lower <a href="/wiki/Clickthrough_rate" class="mw-redirect" title="Clickthrough rate">clickthrough rate</a> (CTR) for advertisements than most major Web sites. According to BusinessWeek.com, banner advertisements on Facebook have generally received one-fifth the number of clicks compared to those on the Web as a whole, although specific comparisons can reveal a much larger disparity. For example, while <a href="/wiki/Google" title="Google">Google</a> users click on the first advertisement for search results an average of 8% of the time (80,000 clicks for every one million searches), Facebook&apos;s users click on advertisements an average of 0.04% of the time (400 clicks for every one million pages).</p>
<p>Sarah Smith, who was Facebook&apos;s Online Sales Operations Manager until 2012, reported that successful <a href="/wiki/Advertising_campaign" title="Advertising campaign">advertising campaigns</a> on the site can have clickthrough rates as low as 0.05% to 0.04%, and that CTR for ads tend to fall within two weeks.</p>
<p>The cause of Facebook&apos;s low CTR has been attributed to younger users enabling <a href="/wiki/Ad_blocking" title="Ad blocking">ad blocking</a> software and their adeptness at ignoring advertising messages, as well as the site&apos;s primary purpose being social communication rather than content viewing. According to digital consultancy iStrategy Labs in mid-January 2014, three million fewer users aged between 13 and 17 years were present on Facebook&apos;s Social Advertising platform compared to 2011. However, <i>Time</i> writer and reporter Christopher Matthews stated in the wake of the iStrategy Labs results:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A big part of Facebook&apos;s pitch is that it has so much information about its users that it can more effectively target ads to those who will be responsive to the content. If Facebook can prove that theory to be true, then it may not worry so much about losing its cool cachet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In December 2014, a report from Frank N. Magid and Associates found that the percentage of teens aged 13 to 17 who used Facebook fell to 88% in 2014, down from 94% in 2013 and 95% in 2012.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg, alongside other Facebook executives, have questioned the data in such reports; although, a former Facebook senior employee has commented: &quot;Mark [Zuckerberg] is very willing to recognize the strengths in other products and the flaws in Facebook.&quot;</p>
<p>On pages for brands and products, however, some companies have reported CTR as high as 6.49% for Wall posts. A study found that, for video advertisements on Facebook, over 40% of users who viewed the videos viewed the entire video, while the industry average was 25% for in-banner video ads.</p>

The deployment of HipHop reportedly reduced average CPU consumption on Facebook servers by 50%.</p>
<p>Facebook is developed as one monolithic application. According to an interview in 2012 with Chuck Rossi, a build engineer at Facebook, Facebook compiles into a 1.5&#xA0;GB binary blob which is then distributed to the servers using a custom <a href="/wiki/BitTorrent" title="BitTorrent">BitTorrent</a>-based release system. Rossi stated that it takes approximately 15 minutes to build and 15 minutes to release to the servers. The build and release process is zero downtime and new changes to Facebook are rolled out daily.</p>
<p>Facebook used a combination platform based on <a href="/wiki/HBase" class="mw-redirect" title="HBase">HBase</a> to store data across distributed machines. Using a tailing architecture, new events are stored in log files, and the logs are tailed. The system rolls these events up and writes them into storage. The User Interface then pulls the data out and displays it to users. Facebook handles requests as <a href="/wiki/Ajax_(programming)" title="Ajax (programming)">AJAX</a> behavior. These requests are written to a log file using <a href="/wiki/Scribe_(log_server)" title="Scribe (log server)">Scribe</a> (developed by Facebook).</p>
<p>Data is read from these log files using Ptail, an internally built tool to aggregate data from multiple Scribe stores. It tails the log files and pulls data out (thus the name). Ptail data is separated out into three streams so they can eventually be sent to their own clusters in different <a href="/wiki/Data_center" title="Data center">data centers</a> (Plugin impression, News feed impressions, Actions (plugin + news feed)). Puma is used to manage periods of high data flow (Input/Output or IO). Data is processed in batches to lessen the number of times needed to read and write under high demand periods (A hot article will generate a lot of impressions and news feed impressions which will cause huge data skews). Batches are taken every 1.5 seconds, limited by memory used when creating a <a href="/wiki/Hash_table" title="Hash table">hash table</a>.</p>
<p>After this, data is output in PHP format (compiled with <a href="/wiki/HipHop_for_PHP" title="HipHop for PHP">HipHop for PHP</a>). The backend is written in <a href="/wiki/Java" title="Java">Java</a> and Thrift is used as the messaging format so PHP programs can query Java services. Caching solutions are used to make the web pages display more quickly. The more and longer data is cached the less realtime it is. The data is then sent to <a href="/wiki/MapReduce" title="MapReduce">MapReduce</a> servers so it can be queried via Hive. This also serves as a backup plan as the data can be recovered from Hive. Raw logs are removed after a period of time.</p>
<p>On March 20, 2014 Facebook announced a new open source programming language called <a href="/wiki/Hack_(programming_language)" title="Hack (programming language)">Hack</a>. Prior to public release, a large portion of Facebook was already running and &quot;battle tested&quot; using the new language.</p>

Described as a &quot;<a href="/wiki/Gmail" title="Gmail">Gmail</a> killer&quot; by some publications, the system allows users to directly communicate with each other via Facebook using several different methods (including a special <a href="/wiki/Email_address" title="Email address">email address</a>, text messaging, or through the Facebook website or mobile app)&#x2014;no matter what method is used to deliver a message, they are contained within single <a href="/wiki/Threaded_discussion" class="mw-redirect" title="Threaded discussion">threads</a> in a unified inbox. As with other Facebook features, users can adjust from whom they can receive messages&#x2014;including just friends, friends of friends, or from anyone. Email service was terminated in 2014 because of low uptake. Aside from the Facebook website, messages can also be accessed through the site&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Mobile_app" title="Mobile app">mobile apps</a>, or a dedicated <a href="/wiki/Facebook_Messenger" title="Facebook Messenger">Facebook Messenger</a> app.</dd>

It also confirmed that it is recommending additional videos to users after they have watched a video. Sixty-five percent of Facebook&apos;s video views are coming from mobile where Facebook&apos;s user base is shifting, and views grew 50 percent from May to July, in part thanks to the viral ALS <a href="/wiki/Ice_Bucket_Challenge" title="Ice Bucket Challenge">Ice Bucket Challenge</a> finding a home on Facebook.</dd>

<p>The format of individual user pages was revamped in late 2011 and became known as either a profile or personal timeline since that change. Users can create profiles with photos and images, lists of personal interests, contact information, memorable life events, and other personal information, such as employment status. Users can communicate with friends and other users through private or public messages, as well as a chat feature, and share content that includes website URLs, images, and video content. A 2012 Pew Internet and American Life study identified that between 20 and 30 percent of Facebook users are &quot;power users&quot; who frequently link, poke, post and tag themselves and others.</p>
<p>In 2007, Facebook launched Facebook Pages (also called &quot;Fan Pages&quot; by users) to allow &quot;users to interact and affiliate with businesses and organizations in the same way they interact with other Facebook user profiles&quot;. On November 6, 2007, more than 100,000 Facebook pages were launched.</p>
<p>In July 2012, Facebook added a <a href="/wiki/Same-sex_marriage" title="Same-sex marriage">same-sex marriage</a> icon to its timeline feature. On February 14, 2014, Facebook expanded the options for user&apos;s gender setting, adding a custom input field that allows users to choose from a wide range of gender identities. Users can also set which set of gender-specific pronouns are used in reference to them throughout the site. The change occurs after Nepal&apos;s first openly gay politician <a href="/wiki/Sunil_Babu_Pant" title="Sunil Babu Pant">Sunil Babu Pant</a> sent a letter to Zuckerberg in early 2012 to request the addition of an &quot;Other&quot; gender option for Facebook users; Facebook&apos;s official statement on the issue: &quot;People can already opt out of showing their sex on their profile. We&apos;re constantly innovating on our products and features and we welcome input from everyone as we explore ways to improve the Facebook experience.&quot;</p>
<p>On June 13, 2009, Facebook introduced a &quot;Usernames&quot; feature, whereby pages can be linked with simpler <a href="/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator" class="mw-redirect" title="Uniform resource locator">URLs</a> such as <code><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.facebook.com/facebook">https://www.facebook.com/name</a></code> instead of <code><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=20531316728">https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=20531316728</a></code>. Many new <a href="/wiki/Smartphone" title="Smartphone">smartphones</a> offer access to Facebook services through either their Web browsers or applications. An official Facebook application is available for the operating systems <a href="/wiki/Android_(operating_system)" title="Android (operating system)">Android</a>, <a href="/wiki/IOS" title="IOS">iOS</a>, <a href="/wiki/WebOS" title="WebOS">webOS</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Firefox_OS" title="Firefox OS">Firefox OS</a>. <a href="/wiki/Nokia" title="Nokia">Nokia</a> and <a href="/wiki/BlackBerry_(company)" class="mw-redirect" title="BlackBerry (company)">Research In Motion</a> both provide Facebook applications for their own mobile devices.

<p>In May 2014, Facebook introduced a feature to allow users to ask for information not disclosed by other users on their profiles. If a user does not provide key information, such as location, hometown, or relationship status, other users can use a new &apos;ask&apos; button to send a message asking about that item to the user in a single click.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="News_Feed">News Feed</span></h3>
<p>On September 6, 2006, <a href="/wiki/News_Feed_(Facebook)" class="mw-redirect" title="News Feed (Facebook)">News Feed</a> was announced, which appears on every user&apos;s homepage and highlights information including profile changes, upcoming events, and birthdays of the user&apos;s friends. This enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays to attract attention to their profile or cause. Initially, the News Feed caused dissatisfaction among Facebook users; some complained it was too cluttered and full of undesired information, others were concerned that it made it too easy for others to track individual activities (such as relationship status changes, events, and conversations with other users).</p>
<p>In response, Zuckerberg issued an apology for the site&apos;s failure to include appropriate customizable privacy features. Since then, users have been able to control what types of information are shared automatically with friends. Users are now able to prevent user-set categories of friends from seeing updates about certain types of activities, including profile changes, Wall posts, and newly added friends.</p>
<p>On February 23, 2010, Facebook was granted a patent on certain aspects of its News Feed. The patent covers News Feeds in which links are provided so that one user can participate in the same activity of another user. The patent may encourage Facebook to pursue action against websites that violate its patent, which may potentially include websites such as <a href="/wiki/Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>One of the most popular applications on Facebook is the <a href="/wiki/Facebook_features#Photo_and_video_uploads" title="Facebook features">Photos</a> application, where users can upload albums and photos. Facebook allows users to upload an unlimited number of photos, compared with other <a href="/wiki/Image_hosting_service" title="Image hosting service">image hosting services</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Photobucket" title="Photobucket">Photobucket</a> and <a href="/wiki/Flickr" title="Flickr">Flickr</a>, which apply limits to the number of photos that a user is allowed to upload. During the first years, Facebook users were limited to 60&#xA0;photos per album. As of May 2009, this limit has been increased to 200&#xA0;photos per album.</p>
<p>Privacy settings can be set for individual albums, limiting the groups of users that can see an album. For example, the privacy of an album can be set so that only the user&apos;s friends can see the album, while the privacy of another album can be set so that all Facebook users can see it. Another feature of the Photos application is the ability to &quot;<a href="/wiki/Tag_(metadata)" title="Tag (metadata)">tag</a>&quot;, or label, users in a photo. For instance, if a photo contains a user&apos;s friend, then the user can tag the friend in the photo. This sends a notification to the friend that they have been tagged, and provides them a link to see the photo.</p>
<p>On June 7, 2012, Facebook launched its App Center to its users. It will help the users in finding games and other applications with ease. Since the launch of the App Center, Facebook has seen 150M monthly users with 2.4 times the installation of apps.</p>
<p>The sorting and display of stories in a user&apos;s News Feed is governed by the <a href="/wiki/EdgeRank" title="EdgeRank">EdgeRank</a> algorithm.</p>
<p>On May 13, 2015 Facebook in association with major news portals launched a program &quot;Instant Articles&quot; to provide rich news experience. Instant articles provides users, access to articles on Facebook news feed without leaving the site.</p>
<p>According to the technology news web site <a href="/wiki/Gizmodo" title="Gizmodo">Gizmodo</a> on May 9, 2016, Facebook curators routinely suppresses or promotes news that is deemed to meet a political agenda. For example, articles about <a href="/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter" title="Black Lives Matter">Black Lives Matter</a> would be listed even if they did not meet the trending criteria of News Feed. Likewise positive news about conservative political figures were regularly excised from Facebook pages.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Like_button">Like button</span></h3>

<p>The like button is a social networking feature, allowing users to express their appreciation of content such as status updates, comments, photos, and advertisements. It is also a <a href="/wiki/Facebook_Platform#Social_plugins" title="Facebook Platform">social plug-in of the Facebook Platform</a>&#xA0;&#x2013; launched on April 21, 2010&#xA0;&#x2013; that enables participating Internet websites to display a similar like button.</p>
<p>The sheriff of Hampton, Virginia, US fired employees who liked the Facebook page of an adversary, and a federal appeals court in Virginia ruled that the US Constitution protects the rights of US citizens to like any Facebook page of their choosing. US Circuit Judge William Traxler likened the practice to displaying a &quot;political sign in one&apos;s front yard.&quot; Additionally, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Second_Circuit" title="United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> upheld a <a href="/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board" title="National Labor Relations Board">National Labor Relations Board</a> decision which found that one employee&apos;s &quot;liking&quot; another employee&apos;s negative comments about their employer deserved protection under the <a href="/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Act" title="National Labor Relations Act">National Labor Relations Act</a>, alerting employers to proceed with caution when disciplining employees for Facebook activity.</p>
<p>Following a lengthy period of calls from the public to include a dislike button on the Facebook interface, Zuckerberg explained in a Q&amp;A session on December 11, 2014 that his hesitance was due to a concern about a tone of negativity on the platform, whereby users could &quot;shame&quot; others, and he offered the comment option for situations where people were unwilling to use the like function. However, he said, &quot;We&apos;re [Facebook] thinking about it [dislike button] &#x2026; It&apos;s an interesting question,&quot; and said that he likes the idea of Facebook users being able to express a greater variety of emotions.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Following">Following</span></h3>
<p>On September 14, 2011, Facebook added the ability for users to provide a &quot;Subscribe&quot; button on their page, which allows users to subscribe to public postings by the user without needing to add them as a friend. In conjunction, Facebook also introduced a system in February 2012 to verify the identity of certain accounts.</p>
<p>In December 2012, Facebook announced that because of user confusion surrounding its function, the Subscribe button would be re-labeled as a &quot;Follow&quot; button&#x2014;making it more similar to other social networks with similar functions.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Comparison_with_Myspace">Comparison with Myspace</span></h3>
<p>The media often compares Facebook to <a href="/wiki/Myspace" title="Myspace">Myspace</a>, but one significant difference between the two Web sites is the level of customization. Another difference is Facebook&apos;s requirement that users give their true identity, a demand that MySpace does not make. MySpace allows users to decorate their profiles using <a href="/wiki/HTML" title="HTML">HTML</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" title="Cascading Style Sheets">Cascading Style Sheets</a> (CSS), while Facebook allows only <a href="/wiki/Plain_text" title="Plain text">plain text</a>. Facebook has a number of features with which users may interact. They include the <a href="/wiki/Tag_(Facebook)" class="mw-redirect" title="Tag (Facebook)">Wall</a>, a space on every user&apos;s profile page that allows friends to post messages for the user to see; <a href="/wiki/Super_Poke" class="mw-redirect" title="Super Poke">Pokes</a>, which allows users to send a virtual &quot;poke&quot; to each other (a notification then tells a user that they have been poked); <a href="/wiki/Facebook_features#Photo_and_video_uploads" title="Facebook features">Photos</a>, that allows users to upload albums and photos; and <a href="/wiki/Facebook_features#Status_updates" title="Facebook features">Status</a>, which allows users to inform their friends of their whereabouts and actions. Facebook also allows users to tag various people in photographs. Depending on privacy settings, anyone who can see a user&apos;s profile can also view that user&apos;s Wall. In July 2007, Facebook began allowing users to post attachments to the Wall, whereas the Wall was previously limited to textual content only. Facebook also differs from Myspace in the form of advertising used. Facebook uses advertising in the form of banner ads, referral marketing, and games. Myspace, on the other hand, uses <a href="/wiki/Google" title="Google">Google</a> and <a href="/wiki/AdSense" title="AdSense">AdSense</a>. There is also a difference in the userbase of each site. MySpace, initially, was much more popular with high school students, while Facebook was more popular among college students. A study by the American firm Nielsen Claritas showed that Facebook users are more inclined to use other professional networking sites, such as <a href="/wiki/LinkedIn" title="LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a>, than Myspace users.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Privacy">Privacy</span></h3>
<p>Facebook enables users to choose their own privacy settings and choose who can see specific parts of their profile. The website is free to its users and generates revenue from advertising, such as <a href="/wiki/Web_banner" title="Web banner">banner ads</a>. Facebook requires a user&apos;s name and profile picture (if applicable) to be accessible by everyone. Users can control who sees other information they have shared, as well as who can find them in searches, through their privacy settings.</p>
<p>On November 6, 2007, Facebook launched <a href="/wiki/Facebook_Beacon" title="Facebook Beacon">Facebook Beacon</a>, which was a part of Facebook&apos;s advertisement system until it was discontinued in 2009. Its purpose was to allow targeted advertisements and allowing users to share their activities with their friends.</p>
<p>In 2010, Facebook&apos;s security team began expanding its efforts to reduce the risks to users&apos; <a href="/wiki/Privacy" title="Privacy">privacy</a>, but <a href="/wiki/Criticism_of_Facebook#Privacy_concerns" title="Criticism of Facebook">privacy concerns</a> remain.</p>
<p>Since 2010, among other social media services, the <a href="/wiki/National_Security_Agency" title="National Security Agency">National Security Agency</a> has been taking publicly posted profile information from users Facebook profiles to discover who they interact with.</p>
<p>On November 29, 2011, Facebook settled <a href="/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission" title="Federal Trade Commission">Federal Trade Commission</a> charges that it deceived consumers by failing to keep privacy promises.</p>
<p>In August 2013 <a href="/wiki/High-Tech_Bridge" title="High-Tech Bridge">High-Tech Bridge</a> published a study showing that links included in Facebook messaging service messages were being accessed by Facebook. In January 2014 two users filed a lawsuit against Facebook alleging that their privacy had been violated by this practice.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facebook_Bug_Bounty_Program">Facebook Bug Bounty Program</span></h3>
<p>On July 29, 2011, Facebook announced its Bug Bounty Program in which security researchers will be paid a minimum of $500 for reporting security holes on Facebook website. Facebook&apos;s <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://facebook.com/whitehat">Whitehat</a> page for security researchers says: &quot;If you give us a reasonable time to respond to your report before making any information public and make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service during your research, we will not bring any lawsuit against you or ask law enforcement to investigate you.&quot;</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Facebook started paying researchers who find and report security bugs by issuing them custom branded &quot;White Hat&quot; debit cards that can be reloaded with funds each time the researchers discover new flaws. &quot;Researchers who find bugs and security improvements are rare, and we value them and have to find ways to reward them,&quot; Ryan McGeehan, former manager of Facebook&apos;s security response team, told CNET in an interview. &quot;Having this exclusive black card is another way to recognize them. They can show up at a conference and show this card and say &apos;I did special work for Facebook.&apos;&quot;</p>
<p>India, which has the second largest number of bug hunters in the world, tops the Facebook Bug Bounty Program with the largest number of valid bugs. &quot;Researchers in Russia earned the highest amount per report in 2013, receiving an average of $3,961 for 38 bugs. India contributed the largest number of valid bugs at 136, with an average reward of $1,353. The U.S. reported 92 issues and averaged $2,272 in rewards. Brazil and the UK were third and fourth by volume, with 53 bugs and 40 bugs, respectively, and average rewards of $3,792 and $2,950&quot;, Facebook quoted in a post.</p>

<p>According to <a href="/wiki/ComScore" title="ComScore">comScore</a>, Facebook is the leading social networking site based on monthly unique visitors, having overtaken main competitor <a href="/wiki/MySpace" class="mw-redirect" title="MySpace">MySpace</a> in April 2008. ComScore reports that Facebook attracted 130&#xA0;million unique visitors in May 2010, an increase of 8.6&#xA0;million people. According to third-party <a href="/wiki/Web_analytics" title="Web analytics">web analytics</a> providers, <a href="/wiki/Alexa_Internet" title="Alexa Internet">Alexa</a> and <a href="/wiki/SimilarWeb" title="SimilarWeb">SimilarWeb</a>, Facebook is ranked second and first globally respectively, it is the highest-read social network on the Web, with over 20 billion visitors per month, as of 2015. <a href="/wiki/SimilarWeb" title="SimilarWeb">SimilarWeb</a>, <a href="/wiki/Quantcast" title="Quantcast">Quantcast</a> and <a href="/wiki/Compete.com" title="Compete.com">Compete.com</a> all rank the website 2nd in the U.S. in traffic. The website is the most popular for uploading photos, with 50&#xA0;billion uploaded cumulatively. In 2010, <a href="/wiki/Sophos" title="Sophos">Sophos</a>&apos;s &quot;Security Threat Report 2010&quot; polled over 500 firms, 60% of which responded that they believed that Facebook was the social network that posed the biggest threat to security, well ahead of MySpace, Twitter, and <a href="/wiki/LinkedIn" title="LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook is the most popular social networking site in several <a href="/wiki/List_of_countries_where_English_is_an_official_language" class="mw-redirect" title="List of countries where English is an official language">English-speaking countries</a>, including Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. However, Facebook still receives limited adoption in countries such as Japan, where domestically created social networks are still largely preferred. In regional Internet markets, Facebook penetration is highest in North America (69 percent), followed by Middle East-Africa (67 percent), Latin America (58 percent), Europe (57 percent), and Asia-Pacific (17 percent). Some of the top competitors were listed in 2007 by <a href="/wiki/Mashable" title="Mashable">Mashable</a>.</p>
<p>The website has won awards such as placement into the &quot;Top 100 Classic Websites&quot; by <i><a href="/wiki/PC_Magazine" title="PC Magazine">PC Magazine</a></i> in 2007, and winning the &quot;People&apos;s Voice Award&quot; from the <a href="/wiki/Webby_Award" title="Webby Award">Webby Awards</a> in 2008. In a 2006 study conducted by Student Monitor, a company specializing in research concerning the college student market, Facebook was named the second most popular thing among undergraduates, tied with beer and only ranked lower than the <a href="/wiki/IPod" title="IPod">iPod</a>.</p>
<p>In 2010, Facebook won the <a href="/wiki/Crunchie" title="Crunchie">Crunchie</a> &quot;Best Overall Startup Or Product&quot; for the third year in a row and was recognized as one of the &quot;Hottest <a href="/wiki/Silicon_Valley" title="Silicon Valley">Silicon Valley</a> Companies&quot; by Lead411. However, in a July 2010 survey performed by the <a href="/wiki/American_Customer_Satisfaction_Index" title="American Customer Satisfaction Index">American Customer Satisfaction Index</a>, Facebook received a score of 64 out of 100, placing it in the bottom 5% of all private-sector companies in terms of customer satisfaction, alongside industries such as the <a href="/wiki/IRS_e-file" title="IRS e-file">IRS e-file</a> system, airlines, and <a href="/wiki/Cable_companies" class="mw-redirect" title="Cable companies">cable companies</a>. The reasons why Facebook scored so poorly include privacy problems, frequent changes to the website&apos;s interface, the results returned by the News Feed, and spam.</p>

<p>In December 2008, the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_Australian_Capital_Territory" title="Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory">Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory</a> ruled that Facebook is a valid <a href="/wiki/Protocol_(diplomacy)" title="Protocol (diplomacy)">protocol</a> to serve court notices to defendants.

In March 2009, the New Zealand High Court associate justice David Gendall allowed for the serving of legal papers on Craig Axe by the company Axe Market Garden via Facebook. Employers have also used Facebook as a means to keep tabs on their employees and have even been known to fire them over posts they have made.</p>
<p>By 2005, the use of Facebook had already become so ubiquitous that the generic verb &quot;facebooking&quot; had come into use to describe the process of browsing others&apos; profiles or updating one&apos;s own. In 2008, <a href="/wiki/Collins_English_Dictionary" title="Collins English Dictionary">Collins English Dictionary</a> declared &quot;Facebook&quot; as its new Word of the Year. In December 2009, the <a href="/wiki/New_Oxford_American_Dictionary" title="New Oxford American Dictionary">New Oxford American Dictionary</a> declared its word of the year to be the verb &quot;<a href="/wiki/Unfriend" class="mw-redirect" title="Unfriend">unfriend</a>&quot;, defined as &quot;To remove someone as a &apos;<a href="/wiki/Friend_(Facebook)" class="mw-redirect" title="Friend (Facebook)">friend</a>&apos; on a <a href="/wiki/Social_networking" class="mw-redirect" title="Social networking">social networking</a> site such as Facebook.</p>
<p>In early 2010, <a href="/wiki/Openbook_(website)" title="Openbook (website)">Openbook</a> was established, an avowed <a href="/wiki/Parody" title="Parody">parody</a> (and privacy advocacy) website that enables text-based searches of those Wall posts that are available to &quot;Everyone&quot;, i.e. to everyone on the Internet.</p>
<p>Writers for <i><a href="/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal" title="The Wall Street Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a></i> found in 2010 that Facebook apps were transmitting identifying information to &quot;dozens of advertising and Internet tracking companies&quot;. The apps used an <a href="/wiki/HTTP_referer" title="HTTP referer">HTTP referer</a> which exposed the user&apos;s identity and sometimes their friends&apos;. Facebook said, &quot;We have taken immediate action to disable all applications that violate our terms&quot;.</p>
<p>In May 2014, the countries with the most Facebook users were:</p>

<p>Facebook&apos;s popularity throughout the world (especially as a tool for political movements or procrastination) has led to some countries and employers <a href="/wiki/Censorship_of_Facebook" title="Censorship of Facebook">blocking access</a> to the site.</p>
<p>All of the above total 309 million members or about 38.6 percent of Facebook&apos;s 1 billion worldwide members. As of March 2013, Facebook reported having 1.11 billion monthly active users, globally.</p>

<p>In regards to Facebook&apos;s mobile usage, per an analyst report in early 2013, there are 192 million Android users, 147 million iPhone users, 48 million iPad users and 56 million messenger users, and a total of 604 million mobile Facebook users. In January 2016, Facebook Messenger hits 800 million users.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Electricity_usage">Electricity usage</span></h3>
<p>On April 21, 2011, <a href="/wiki/Greenpeace" title="Greenpeace">Greenpeace</a> released a report showing that of the top ten big brands in cloud computing, Facebook was most reliant on coal for electricity for its data centers. At the time, data centers consumed up to 2% of all global electricity and this amount was projected to increase. <a href="/wiki/Phil_Radford" title="Phil Radford">Phil Radford</a> of Greenpeace said &quot;we are concerned that this new explosion in electricity use could lock us into old, polluting energy sources instead of the clean energy available today.&quot; On December 15, 2011, Greenpeace and Facebook announced together that Facebook would shift to use clean and renewable energy to power its own operations. Marcy Scott Lynn, of Facebook&apos;s sustainability program, said it looked forward &quot;to a day when our primary energy sources are clean and renewable&quot; and that the company is &quot;working with Greenpeace and others to help bring that day closer.&quot;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Google">Google</span></h3>
<p>In May 2011 emails were sent to journalists and bloggers making critical allegations about <a href="/wiki/Google%27s_privacy_policies" class="mw-redirect" title="Google&apos;s privacy policies">Google&apos;s privacy policies</a>; however it was later discovered that <a href="/wiki/Public_relations" title="Public relations">PR</a> giant <a href="/wiki/Burson-Marsteller" title="Burson-Marsteller">Burson-Marsteller</a> was paid for the emails by Facebook .</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Users_violating_minimum_age_requirements">Users violating minimum age requirements</span></h3>
<p>A 2011 study in the online journal <i><a href="/wiki/First_Monday" title="First Monday">First Monday</a></i>, examines how parents consistently enable children as young as 10 years old to sign up for accounts, directly violating Facebook&apos;s policy banning young visitors. This policy is in compliance with a United States law, the 1998 <a href="/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act" title="Children&apos;s Online Privacy Protection Act">Children&apos;s Online Privacy Protection Act</a>, which requires minors aged 13 or younger to gain explicit parental consent to access commercial websites. In other jurisdictions where a similar law sets a lower minimum age, Facebook enforces the lower age. Of the 1,007 households surveyed for the study, 76% of parents reported that their child joined Facebook when they were younger than 13, the minimum age in the site&apos;s terms of service. The study also reported that Facebook removes roughly 20,000 users each day for violating its minimum age policy. The study&apos;s authors also note, &quot;Indeed, Facebook takes various measures both to restrict access to children and delete their accounts if they join.&quot; The findings of the study raise questions primarily about the shortcomings of United States federal law, but also implicitly continue to raise questions about whether or not Facebook does enough to publicize its terms of service with respect to minors. Only 53% of parents said they were aware that Facebook has a minimum signup age; 35% of these parents believe that the minimum age is merely a recommendation, or thought the signup age was 16 or 18, and not 13.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Accounts_hacked_in_Bangalore.2C_India">Accounts hacked in Bangalore, India</span></h3>
<p>In November 2011, several Facebook users in <a href="/wiki/Bangalore" title="Bangalore">Bangalore</a>, India reported that their accounts had been hacked and their profile pictures replaced with pornographic images. For more than a week, users&apos; news feeds were spammed with pornographic, violent and sexual content, and it was reported that more than 200,000 accounts were affected. Facebook described the reports as inaccurate, and Bangalore police speculated that the stories may have been rumors spread by Facebook&apos;s competitors.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Unauthorized_wall_posting_bug">Unauthorized wall posting bug</span></h3>
<p>On August 19, 2013, it was reported that a Facebook user from <a href="/wiki/Yatta,_Hebron" title="Yatta, Hebron">Yatta</a>, <a href="/wiki/West_Bank" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> Khalil Shreateh had found a <a href="/wiki/Software_bug" title="Software bug">bug</a> that allowed him to post material to other users&apos; Facebook Walls. Users are not supposed to have the ability to post material to the Facebook Walls of other users unless they are approved friends of those users that they have posted material to. To prove that he was telling the truth, Shreateh posted material to Sarah Goodin&apos;s wall, a friend of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Following this, Shreateh contacted Facebook&apos;s security team with the proof that his bug was real, explaining in detail what was going on. Facebook has a bounty program in which it compensates people a US$500 fee for reporting bugs instead of using them to their advantage or selling them on the black market. However, it was reported that instead of fixing the bug and paying Shreateh the fee, Facebook originally told him that &quot;this was not a bug&quot; and dismissed him. Shreateh then tried a second time to inform Facebook, but they dismissed him yet again. On the third try, Shreateh used the bug to post a message to Mark Zuckerberg&apos;s Wall, stating &quot;Sorry for breaking your privacy &#x2026; but a couple of days ago, I found a serious Facebook exploit&quot; and that Facebook&apos;s security team was not taking him seriously. Within minutes, a security engineer contacted Shreateh, questioned him on how he performed the move and ultimately acknowledged that it was a bug in the system. Facebook temporarily suspended Shreateh&apos;s account and fixed the bug after several days. Facebook refused to pay out the bounty to Shreateh, stating that by posting to Zuckerberg&apos;s account, Shreateh had violated one of their <a href="/wiki/Terms_of_service" title="Terms of service">terms of service</a> policies and therefore &quot;could not be paid.&quot; Facebook also noted that in Shreateh&apos;s initial reports, he had failed to provide technical details for Facebook to act on the bug.</p>
<p>On August 22, 2013, <a href="/wiki/Yahoo_News" class="mw-redirect" title="Yahoo News">Yahoo News</a> reported that <a href="/wiki/Marc_Maiffret" title="Marc Maiffret">Marc Maiffret</a>, a chief technology officer of the <a href="/wiki/Cyber_security_standards" title="Cyber security standards">cybersecurity</a> firm <a href="/wiki/BeyondTrust" title="BeyondTrust">BeyondTrust</a>, is prompting <a href="/wiki/Hacker_(computer_security)" title="Hacker (computer security)">hackers</a> to support in raising a $10,000 reward for Khalil Shreateh. On August 20, Maiffret stated that he had already raised $9,000 in his efforts, including the $2,000 he himself contributed. He and other hackers alike have denounced Facebook for refusing Shreateh compensation. Stated Maiffret, &quot;He is sitting there in Palestine doing this research on a five-year-old laptop that looks like it is half broken. It&apos;s something that might help him out in a big way.&quot; Facebook representatives have since responded, &quot;We will not change our practice of refusing to pay rewards to researchers who have tested vulnerabilities against real users.&quot; Facebook representatives also claimed they&apos;d paid out over $1 million to individuals who have discovered bugs in the past.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Users_quitting">Users quitting</span></h3>
<p>A 2013 study examined the reasons users eventually quit the site. It found the most common reasons were privacy concerns (48%), general dissatisfaction with Facebook (14%), negative aspects regarding Facebook friends (13%) and the feeling of getting addicted to Facebook (6%). Facebook quitters were found to be more concerned about privacy, more addicted to the Internet and more conscientious.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="iPhone_.27Paper.27_app">iPhone &apos;Paper&apos; app</span></h3>
<p>Following the release of the Facebook <a href="/wiki/IPhone_app" class="mw-redirect" title="IPhone app">iPhone app</a> &quot;Paper&quot; at the beginning of February 2014, developer company <a href="/wiki/FiftyThree,_Inc." class="mw-redirect" title="FiftyThree, Inc.">FiftyThree</a> sent a correspondence to the social media company regarding its own app, also entitled Paper and trademarked in 2012, asking Facebook to cease using an app name that they consider their own. In response, Facebook stated that it will continue to use the Paper title but conceded that it should have informed FiftyThree at an earlier point in time. FiftyThree articulated its desired outcome in a blog post: &quot;There&apos;s a simple fix here. We think Facebook can apply the same degree of thought they put into the app into building a brand name of their own. An app about stories shouldn&apos;t start with someone else&apos;s story. Facebook should stop using our brand name.&quot;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Lane_v._Facebook.2C_Inc.">Lane v. Facebook, Inc.</span></h3>
<p>On March 2010, Judge Richard Seeborg issued an order approving the class settlement in <i><a href="/wiki/Lane_v._Facebook,_Inc." title="Lane v. Facebook, Inc.">Lane v. Facebook, Inc.</a></i> This lawsuit charged that user&apos;s private information was being posted on Facebook without consent using Facebook&apos;s Beacon program.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="User_influence_experiments">User influence experiments</span></h3>
<p>Academic and Facebook researchers have collaborated to test if the messages people see on Facebook can influence their behavior. For instance, in &quot;A 61-Million-Person Experiment in Social Influence And Political Mobilization,&quot; during the 2010 elections, Facebook users were given the opportunity to &quot;tell your friends you voted&quot; by clicking on an &quot;I voted&quot; button. Users were 2% more likely to click the button if it was associated with friends who had already voted.</p>
<p>Much more controversially, a 2014 study of &quot;Emotional Contagion Through Social Networks&quot; manipulated the balance of positive and negative messages seen by 689,000 Facebook users. The researchers concluded that they had found &quot;some of the first experimental evidence to support the controversial claims that emotions can spread throughout a network, [though] the effect sizes from the manipulations are small.&quot;</p>
<p>Unlike the &quot;I voted&quot; study, which had presumptively beneficial ends and raised few concerns, this study was criticized for both its ethics and methods/claims. As controversy about the study grew, Adam Kramer, a lead author of both studies and member of the Facebook data team, defended the work in a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.facebook.com/akramer/posts/10152987150867796">Facebook update</a>. A few days later, Sheryl Sandburg, Facebook&apos;s COO, made a statement while traveling abroad. While at an Indian Chambers of Commerce event in New Delhi she stated that &quot;This was part of ongoing research companies do to test different products, and that was what it was. It was poorly communicated and for that communication we apologize. We never meant to upset you.&quot;</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, on July 3, 2014, <a href="/wiki/USA_Today" title="USA Today">USA Today</a> reported that the privacy watchdog group <a href="/wiki/Electronic_Privacy_Information_Center" title="Electronic Privacy Information Center">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> (EPIC) had filed a formal complaint with the Federal Trade claiming that Facebook had broken the law when it conducted the study on the emotions of its users without their knowledge or consent. In its complaint, EPIC alleged that Facebook had deceived it users by secretly conducting a psychological experiment on their emotions: &quot;At the time of the experiment, Facebook did not state in the Data Use Policy that user data would be used for research purposes. Facebook also failed to inform users that their personal information would be shared with researchers.&quot;</p>
<p>Beyond the ethical concerns, other scholars criticized the methods and reporting of the study&apos;s findings. John Grohol, writing at PsycCentral, argued that despite its title and claims of &quot;<a href="/wiki/Emotional_contagion" title="Emotional contagion">emotional contagion</a>,&quot; this study did not look at emotions at all. Instead, its authors used an application (called &quot;Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count&quot; or LIWC 2007) that simply counted positive and negative words in order to infer users&apos; sentiments. He wrote that a shortcoming of the LIWC tool is that it does not understand negations. Hence, the tweet &quot;I am not happy&quot; would be scored as positive: &quot;Since the LIWC 2007 ignores these subtle realities of informal human communication, so do the researchers.&quot; Grohol concluded that given these subtleties, the <a href="/wiki/Effect_size" title="Effect size">effect size</a> of the findings are little more than a &quot;statistical blip.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kramer et al. (2014) found a 0.07% &#x2014; that&apos;s not 7 percent, that&apos;s 1/15th of one percent!! &#x2014; decrease in negative words in people&apos;s status updates when the number of negative posts on their Facebook news feed decreased. Do you know how many words you&apos;d have to read or write before you&apos;ve written one less negative word due to this effect? Probably thousands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The consequences of the controversy are pending (be it FTC or court proceedings) but it did prompt an &quot;<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/07/02/1412469111.full.pdf+html">Editorial Expression of Concern</a>&quot; from its publisher, the <a href="/wiki/Proceedings_of_the_National_Academy_of_Sciences" class="mw-redirect" title="Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>, as well as an blog posting from <a href="/wiki/OkCupid" title="OkCupid">OkCupid</a> that &quot;<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/we-experiment-on-human-beings/">We experiment on human beings</a>!&quot; In September 2014, law professor James Grimmelmann argued that the actions of both companies were &quot;illegal, immoral, and mood-altering&quot; and filed notices with the Maryland Attorney General and Cornell Institutional Review Board.</p>
<p>In the UK, the study was also criticised by the <a href="/wiki/British_Psychological_Society" title="British Psychological Society">British Psychological Society</a> which said, in a letter to <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i>, &quot;There has undoubtedly been some degree of harm caused, with many individuals affected by increased levels of negative emotion, with consequent potential economic costs, increase in possible mental health problems and burden on health services. The so-called &apos;positive&apos; manipulation is also potentially harmful.&quot;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Real-name_policy_controversy_and_compromise">Real-name policy controversy and compromise</span></h3>

<p>Facebook has a <a href="/wiki/Real-name_system" title="Real-name system">real-name system</a> policy for <a href="/wiki/User_profile" title="User profile">user profiles</a>. The real-name policy stems from the position &quot;that way, you always know who you&apos;re connecting with. This helps keep our community safe.&quot; Facebook&apos;s real-name system does not allow adopted names or <a href="/wiki/Pseudonym" title="Pseudonym">pseudonyms</a>, and in its enforcement has suspended accounts of legitimate users, until the user provides identification indicating the name. Facebook representatives have described these incidents as very rare. A user claimed responsibility via the <a href="/wiki/Anonymous_social_media" title="Anonymous social media">anonymous</a> <a href="/wiki/Android_(operating_system)" title="Android (operating system)">Android</a> and <a href="/wiki/IOS" title="IOS">iOS</a> app <a href="/wiki/Secret_(app)" title="Secret (app)">Secret</a> for reporting &quot;fake names&quot; which caused user profiles to be suspended, specifically targeting the <a href="/wiki/Stage_name" title="Stage name">stage names</a> of <a href="/wiki/Drag_queen" title="Drag queen">drag queens</a>. On October 1, 2014, <a href="/wiki/Chris_Cox_(Facebook)" title="Chris Cox (Facebook)">Chris Cox</a>, Chief Product Officer at Facebook, offered an apology: &quot;In the two weeks since the real-name policy issues surfaced, we&apos;ve had the chance to hear from many of you in these communities and understand the policy more clearly as you experience it. We&apos;ve also come to understand how painful this has been. We owe you a better service and a better experience using Facebook, and we&apos;re going to fix the way this policy gets handled so everyone affected here can go back to using Facebook as you were.&quot;</p>
<p>On December 15, 2015, Facebook announced in a press release that it would be providing a compromise to its real name policy after protests from groups such as the gay/lesbian community and abuse-victims. The site is developing a protocol that will allow members to provide specifics as to their &quot;special circumstance&quot; or &quot;unique situation&quot; with a request to use pseudonyms, subject to verification of their true identities. At that time, this was already being tested in the U.S. Product manager Todd Gage and vice president of global operations Justin Osofsky also promised a new method for reducing the number of members who must go through ID verification while ensuring the safety of others on Facebook. The fake name reporting procedure will also be modified, forcing anyone who makes such an allegation to provide specifics that would be investigated and giving the accused individual time to dispute the allegation.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id=".22Free_basics.22_controversy_in_India">&quot;Free basics&quot; controversy in India</span></h3>
<p>In February 2016, <a href="/wiki/TRAI" class="mw-redirect" title="TRAI">TRAI</a> ruled against differential data pricing for limited services from mobile phone operators effectively ending zero-rating platforms in India.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Media_impact">Media impact</span></h3>
<p>In April 2011, Facebook launched a new portal for marketers and creative agencies to help them develop brand promotions on Facebook. The company began its push by inviting a select group of British advertising leaders to meet Facebook&apos;s top executives at an &quot;influencers&apos; summit&quot; in February 2010. Facebook has now been involved in campaigns for <i><a href="/wiki/True_Blood" title="True Blood">True Blood</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/American_Idol" title="American Idol">American Idol</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Top_Gear_(2002_TV_series)" title="Top Gear (2002 TV series)">Top Gear</a></i>. News and media outlets such as the Washington Post, Financial Times and ABC News have used aggregated Facebook fan data to create various infographics and charts to accompany their articles. In 2012, the beauty pageant <a href="/wiki/Miss_Sri_Lanka_Online" title="Miss Sri Lanka Online">Miss Sri Lanka Online</a> was run exclusively using Facebook.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_impact">Social impact</span></h3>

<p>Facebook has affected the social life and activity of people in various ways. Facebook allows people using computers or mobile phones to continuously stay in touch with friends, relatives and other acquaintances wherever they are in the world, as long as there is access to the Internet. It has reunited lost family members and friends. It allows users to trade ideas, stay informed with local or global developments, and unite people with common interests and/or beliefs through open, closed and private groups and other pages.</p>
<p>Facebook&apos;s social impact has also changed how people communicate. Rather than having to reply to others through email, Facebook allows users to broadcast or share content to others, and thereby to engage others or be engaged with others&apos; posts.</p>
<p>Facebook has been successful and more socially impactful than many other social media sites. David Kirkpatrick, technology journalist and author of <i>The Facebook Effect</i>, believes that Facebook is structured in a way that is not easily replaceable. He challenges users to consider how difficult it would be to move all the relationships and photos to an alternative. Facebook has let people participate in an atmosphere with the &quot;over the backyard fence quality&quot; of a small town, despite the move to larger cities. As per <a href="/wiki/Pew_Research_Center" title="Pew Research Center">Pew Research Center</a> survey, 44 percent of the overall population gets news through Facebook.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Emotional_health_impact">Emotional health impact</span></h3>
<p>Recent studies have shown that Facebook causes negative effects on <a href="/wiki/Self-esteem" title="Self-esteem">self-esteem</a> by triggering feelings of envy, with vacation and holiday photos proving to be the largest resentment triggers. Other prevalent causes of envy include posts by friends about family happiness and images of physical beauty&#x2014;such envious feelings leave people lonely and dissatisfied with their own lives. A joint study by two German universities discovered that one out of three people were more dissatisfied with their lives after visiting Facebook, and another study by <a href="/wiki/Utah_Valley_University" title="Utah Valley University">Utah Valley University</a> found that college students felt worse about their own lives following an increase in the amount of time spent on Facebook.</p>
<p>According to professor of psychology Susan Krauss Whitbourne, although Facebook has an upside of friending people, there is also the downside of having someone <a href="/wiki/Unfriend" class="mw-redirect" title="Unfriend">unfriend</a> or reject another person. Whitbourne refers to unfriended persons on Facebook as victims of <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/estrangement" class="extiw" title="wikt:estrangement">estrangement</a>. Unfriending someone is seldom a mutual decision and the person often does not know they have been unfriended.</p>

<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Arab_Spring" title="Arab Spring">Arab Spring</a> many journalists made claims that Facebook played a major role in generating the <a href="/wiki/2011_Egyptian_revolution" class="mw-redirect" title="2011 Egyptian revolution">2011 Egyptian revolution</a>. On January 14, the Facebook page of &quot;We are all khaled Said&quot; was started by Wael Ghoniem Create Event to invite the Egyptian people to &quot;peaceful demonstrations&quot; on January 25. According to <a href="/wiki/Mashable" title="Mashable">Mashable</a>, in Tunisia and Egpyt, Facebook became the primary tool for connecting all protesters and led the Egyptian government of Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Ahmed_Nazif" title="Ahmed Nazif">Nazif</a> to ban Facebook, Twitter and another websites on January 26 then ban all mobile and Internet connections for all of Egypt at midnight January 28. After 18 days, the uprising forced President <a href="/wiki/Mubarak" class="mw-redirect" title="Mubarak">Mubarak</a> to resign.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Bahraini_uprising_of_2011" title="Bahraini uprising of 2011">Bahrain uprising</a> which started on February 14, 2011, Facebook was utilized by the Bahraini regime as well as regime loyalists to identify, capture and prosecute citizens involved in the protests. A 20-year-old girl named <a href="/wiki/Ayat_Al-Qurmezi" title="Ayat Al-Qurmezi">Ayat Al Qurmezi</a> was identified as a protester using Facebook, taken from her home by masked commandos and put in prison.</p>
<p>In 2011, Facebook filed paperwork with the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission" title="Federal Election Commission">Federal Election Commission</a> to form a <a href="/wiki/Political_action_committee" title="Political action committee">political action committee</a> under the name <i>FB PAC</i>. In an email to <i><a href="/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)" title="The Hill (newspaper)">The Hill</a></i>, a spokesman for Facebook said &quot;Facebook <a href="/wiki/Political_Action_Committee" class="mw-redirect" title="Political Action Committee">Political Action Committee</a> will give our employees a way to make their voice heard in the political process by supporting candidates who share our goals of promoting the value of innovation to our economy while giving people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.&quot;</p>
<p>During the Syrian civil war, the <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Protection_Units" title="People&apos;s Protection Units">YPG</a>, a libertarian army for <a href="/wiki/Rojava" title="Rojava">Rojava</a> has recruited westerners through Facebook in its fight against <a href="/wiki/ISIL" class="mw-redirect" title="ISIL">ISIL</a>. Dozens have joined its ranks for various reasons from religious to ideological. The Facebook page&apos;s name &quot;The Lions of Rojava&quot; comes from a Kurdish saying which translates as &quot;A lion is a lion, whether it&apos;s a female or a male&quot;, reflecting the organisation&apos;s feminist ideology.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="United_States">United States</span></h4>
<p>Facebook&apos;s role in the American political process was demonstrated in January 2008, shortly before the <a href="/wiki/New_Hampshire_primary" title="New Hampshire primary">New Hampshire primary</a>, when Facebook teamed up with <a href="/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> and <a href="/wiki/Saint_Anselm_College" title="Saint Anselm College">Saint Anselm College</a> to allow users to give live feedback about the &quot;back to back&quot; January 5 Republican and Democratic debates. Facebook users took part in debate groups organized around specific topics, register to vote, and message questions.</p>
<p>Over a million people installed the Facebook application &quot;US Politics on Facebook&quot; in order to take part, and the application measured users&apos; responses to specific comments made by the debating candidates. This debate showed the broader community what many young students had already experienced: Facebook as a popular and powerful new way to interact and voice opinions. A poll by <a href="/wiki/CBS_News" title="CBS News">CBS News</a>, <a href="/wiki/UWIRE" title="UWIRE">UWIRE</a> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Chronicle_of_Higher_Education" title="The Chronicle of Higher Education">The Chronicle of Higher Education</a></i> claimed to illustrate how the &quot;Facebook effect&quot; has affected youth voting rates, support by youth of political candidates, and general involvement by the youth population in the 2008 election.</p>
<p>The new social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, made use first of the personal computer and the Internet, and after 2010 of the smart phones to connect hundreds of millions of people, especially those under age 35. By 2008, politicians and interest groups were experimenting with systematic use of social media to spread their message among much larger audiences than they had previously reached.</p>
<p>Facebook is having an impact on local government as well. <a href="/wiki/Justin_Smith_(Colorado_sheriff)" title="Justin Smith (Colorado sheriff)">Justin Smith</a>, a Colorado sheriff uses Facebook to disseminate his ideas on matters relating to local, state, and national concerns. He also publicizes crimes, particularly those that his department solves. He has seven thousand followers on the social medium, considered a large number. Smith said that he rarely goes out in public &quot;when I don&apos;t get feedback from folks. &#x2026; Facebook is an interesting tool because I think it holds candidates and elected officials more accountable. Voters know where someone stands.&quot;</p>
<p>As American political strategists turn their attention to the 2016 presidential contest, they identify Facebook as an increasingly important advertising tool. Recent technical innovations have made possible more advanced divisions and subdivisions of the electorate. Most important, Facebook can now deliver video ads to small, highly targeted subsets. Television, by contrast, shows the same commercials to all viewers, and so cannot be precisely tailored.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ban">Ban</span></h3>
<p>In many countries the social networking sites and mobile apps have been blocked temporarily or permanently. In Bangladesh, the government has been blocking Facebook, WhatsApp, Tango, Viber and many other sites and apps since November 18, 2015.</p>
