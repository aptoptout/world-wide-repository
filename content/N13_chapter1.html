<p>The <b>potato</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Starch" title="Starch">starchy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tuber" title="Tuber">tuberous</a> <a href="/wiki/Crop" title="Crop">crop</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Perennial_plant" title="Perennial plant">perennial</a> <a href="/wiki/Solanaceae" title="Solanaceae">nightshade</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Solanum" title="Solanum">Solanum</a> tuberosum</i> L. The word &quot;potato&quot; may refer either to the plant itself or to the edible tuber. In the <a href="/wiki/Andes" title="Andes">Andes</a>, where the species is indigenous, there are some other closely related cultivated potato species. Potatoes were introduced outside the Andes region approximately four centuries ago, and have since become an integral part of much of the world&apos;s food supply. It is the world&apos;s fourth-largest food crop, following <a href="/wiki/Maize" title="Maize">maize</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Rice" title="Rice">rice</a>. The green leaves and green skins of tubers exposed to the light are toxic.</p><p>Wild potato species can be found throughout <a href="/wiki/The_Americas" class="mw-redirect" title="The Americas">the Americas</a> from the United States to southern <a href="/wiki/Chile" title="Chile">Chile</a>. The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated independently in multiple locations, but later genetic testing of the wide variety of <a href="/wiki/Cultivar" title="Cultivar">cultivars</a> and wild species proved a single <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_(ecology)" title="Indigenous (ecology)">origin</a> for potatoes in the area of present-day southern <a href="/wiki/Peru" title="Peru">Peru</a> and extreme northwestern <a href="/wiki/Bolivia" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> (from a species in the <i><a href="/wiki/Solanum_brevicaule" title="Solanum brevicaule">Solanum brevicaule</a></i> complex), where they were domesticated approximately 7,000&#x2013;10,000 years ago. Following centuries of <a href="/wiki/Selective_breeding" title="Selective breeding">selective breeding</a>, there are now over a thousand different types of potatoes. Over 99% of the presently cultivated potatoes worldwide descended from varieties that originated in the lowlands of south-central Chile, which have displaced formerly popular varieties from the <a href="/wiki/Andes" title="Andes">Andes</a>.</p><p>However, the local importance of the potato is variable and changing rapidly. It remains an essential crop in Europe (especially eastern and central Europe), where per capita production is still the highest in the world, but the most rapid expansion over the past few decades has occurred in southern and eastern Asia. As of 2007 <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a> led the world in potato production, and nearly a third of the world&apos;s potatoes were harvested in China and <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>.</p><p>The English word <i>potato</i> comes from Spanish <i>patata</i> (the name used in Spain). The <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Royal_Academy" class="mw-redirect" title="Spanish Royal Academy">Spanish Royal Academy</a> says the Spanish word is a compound of the <a href="/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno_language" title="Ta&#xED;no language">Ta&#xED;no</a> <i>batata</i> and the <a href="/wiki/Quechua_languages" class="mw-redirect" title="Quechua languages">Quechua</a> <i>papa</i> (potato). The name potato originally referred to a type of sweet potato although the two plants are not closely related; in many of the chronicles detailing agriculture and plants, no distinction is made between the two. The 16th-century English herbalist <a href="/wiki/John_Gerard" title="John Gerard">John Gerard</a> used the terms &quot;bastard potatoes&quot; and &quot;Virginia potatoes&quot; for this species, and referred to sweet potatoes as &quot;common potatoes&quot;. Potatoes are occasionally referred to as &quot;Irish potatoes&quot; or &quot;white potatoes&quot; in the United States, to distinguish them from <a href="/wiki/Sweet_potato" title="Sweet potato">sweet potatoes</a>.</p><p>The name <b>spud</b> for a small potato comes from the digging of soil (or a hole) prior to the planting of potatoes. The word has an unknown origin and was originally (c. 1440) used as a term for a short knife or dagger, probably related to Dutch <i>spyd</i> or the Latin &quot;spad-&quot; a word root meaning &quot;sword&quot;; cf. Spanish &quot;espada&quot;, English &quot;spade&quot; and &quot;spadroon&quot;. The word spud traces back to the 16th century. It subsequently transferred over to a variety of digging tools. Around 1845, the name transferred to the tuber itself. The origin of the word &quot;spud&quot; has erroneously been attributed to a 19th-century activist group dedicated to keeping the potato out of <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland">Britain</a>, calling itself The Society for the Prevention of an Unwholesome Diet <small>(S.P.U.D.)</small>. It was <a href="/wiki/Mario_Pei" title="Mario Pei">Mario Pei</a>&apos;s 1949 <i>The Story of Language</i> that can be blamed for the word&apos;s <a href="/wiki/False_etymology" title="False etymology">false origin</a>. Pei writes, &quot;the potato, for its part, was in disrepute some centuries ago. Some Englishmen who did not fancy potatoes formed a Society for the Prevention of Unwholesome Diet. The initials of the main words in this title gave rise to spud.&quot; Like most other pre-20th century <a href="/wiki/Acronym" title="Acronym">acronymic</a> origins, this is false.</p><p>Potato plants are herbaceous <a href="/wiki/Perennial" class="mw-redirect" title="Perennial">perennials</a> that grow about 60&#xA0;cm (24&#xA0;in) high, depending on variety, with the leaves <a href="/wiki/Plant_senescence" title="Plant senescence">dying back</a> after flowering, fruiting and tuber formation. They bear white, pink, red, blue, or purple flowers with yellow <a href="/wiki/Stamen" title="Stamen">stamens</a>. In general, the tubers of varieties with white flowers have white skins, while those of varieties with colored flowers tend to have pinkish skins. Potatoes are mostly <a href="/wiki/Pollination" title="Pollination">cross-pollinated</a> by insects such as <a href="/wiki/Bumblebee" title="Bumblebee">bumblebees</a>, which carry pollen from other potato plants, though a substantial amount of self-fertilizing occurs as well. Tubers form in response to decreasing day length, although this tendency has been minimized in commercial varieties.</p><p>After flowering, potato plants produce small green fruits that resemble green <a href="/wiki/Cherry_tomato" title="Cherry tomato">cherry tomatoes</a>, each containing about 300 <a href="/wiki/Seed" title="Seed">seeds</a>. Like all parts of the plant except the tubers, the fruit contain the toxic <a href="/wiki/Alkaloid" title="Alkaloid">alkaloid</a> <a href="/wiki/Solanine" title="Solanine">solanine</a> and are therefore unsuitable for consumption. All new potato varieties are grown from seeds, also called &quot;true potato seed&quot;, &quot;TPS&quot; or &quot;botanical seed&quot; to distinguish it from seed tubers. New varieties grown from seed can be <a href="/wiki/Vegetative_propagation" class="mw-redirect" title="Vegetative propagation">propagated vegetatively</a> by planting tubers, pieces of tubers cut to include at least one or two eyes, or cuttings, a practice used in greenhouses for the production of healthy seed tubers. Plants propagated from tubers are clones of the parent, whereas those propagated from seed produce a range of different varieties.</p><p>There are about 5,000 potato varieties worldwide. Three thousand of them are found in the Andes alone, mainly in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, and Colombia. They belong to eight or nine species, depending on the taxonomic school. Apart from the 5,000 cultivated varieties, there are about 200 wild species and subspecies, many of which can be cross-bred with cultivated varieties. Cross-breeding has been done repeatedly to transfer resistances to certain pests and diseases from the gene pool of wild species to the gene pool of cultivated potato species. <a href="/wiki/Genetically_modified_food" title="Genetically modified food">Genetically modified</a> varieties have met public resistance in the United States and in the European Union.</p><p>The major species grown worldwide is <i>Solanum tuberosum</i> (a <a href="/wiki/Tetraploid" class="mw-redirect" title="Tetraploid">tetraploid</a> with 48 <a href="/wiki/Chromosome" title="Chromosome">chromosomes</a>), and modern varieties of this species are the most widely cultivated. There are also four diploid species (with 24 chromosomes): <i>S.&#xA0;stenotomum</i>, <i>S.&#xA0;phureja</i>, <i>S.&#xA0;goniocalyx</i>, and <i>S.&#xA0;ajanhuiri</i>. There are two triploid species (with 36 chromosomes): <i>S.&#xA0;chaucha</i> and <i>S.&#xA0;juzepczukii</i>. There is one pentaploid cultivated species (with 60 chromosomes): <i>S.&#xA0;curtilobum</i>. There are two major subspecies of <i>Solanum tuberosum</i>: <i>andigena</i>, or Andean; and <i>tuberosum</i>, or Chilean. The Andean potato is adapted to the short-day conditions prevalent in the mountainous equatorial and tropical regions where it originated; the Chilean potato, however, native to the <a href="/wiki/Chilo%C3%A9_Archipelago" title="Chilo&#xE9; Archipelago">Chilo&#xE9; Archipelago</a>, is adapted to the long-day conditions prevalent in the higher latitude region of southern Chile.</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/International_Potato_Center" title="International Potato Center">International Potato Center</a>, based in <a href="/wiki/Lima,_Peru" class="mw-redirect" title="Lima, Peru">Lima, Peru</a>, holds an <a href="/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization" title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</a>-accredited collection of potato <a href="/wiki/Germplasm" title="Germplasm">germplasm</a>. The international Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium announced in 2009 that they had achieved a draft sequence of the potato genome. The potato genome contains 12 chromosomes and 860 million base pairs, making it a medium-sized plant genome. More than 99 percent of all current <a href="/wiki/Variety_(botany)" title="Variety (botany)">varieties</a> of potatoes currently grown are direct descendants of a subspecies that once grew in the <a href="/wiki/Lowland" class="mw-redirect" title="Lowland">lowlands</a> of south-central <a href="/wiki/Chile" title="Chile">Chile</a>. Nonetheless, genetic testing of the wide variety of <a href="/wiki/Cultivar" title="Cultivar">cultivars</a> and wild species affirms that all potato subspecies derive from a single <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_(ecology)" title="Indigenous (ecology)">origin</a> in the area of present-day southern <a href="/wiki/Peru" title="Peru">Peru</a> and extreme northwestern <a href="/wiki/Bolivia" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> (from a species in the <i>Solanum brevicaule</i> complex).</p><p>Most modern potatoes grown in North America arrived through European settlement and not independently from the South American sources; however, at least one wild potato species, <i>Solanum fendleri</i>, is found as far north as Texas and is used in breeding for resistance to a <a href="/wiki/Nematode" title="Nematode">nematode</a> species that attacks cultivated potatoes. A secondary center of genetic variability of the potato is Mexico, where important wild species that have been used extensively in modern breeding are found, such as the hexaploid <i>Solanum demissum</i>, as a source of resistance to the devastating late blight disease. Another relative native to this region, <i><a href="/wiki/Solanum_bulbocastanum" title="Solanum bulbocastanum">Solanum bulbocastanum</a></i>, has been used to genetically engineer the potato to resist potato blight.</p><p>Potatoes yield abundantly with little effort, and adapt readily to diverse climates as long as the climate is cool and moist enough for the plants to gather sufficient water from the soil to form the starchy tubers. Potatoes do not keep very well in storage and are vulnerable to molds that feed on the stored tubers and quickly turn them rotten, however: crops such as grain can be stored for several years with a low risk of rot. The yield of Calories per acre (about 9.2 million) is higher than that of maize (7.5 million), rice (7.4 million), wheat (3 million), or <a href="/wiki/Soybean" title="Soybean">soybean</a> (2.8 million).</p><p>The potato was first domesticated in the region of modern-day southern <a href="/wiki/Peru" title="Peru">Peru</a> and extreme northwestern <a href="/wiki/Bolivia" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> between 8000 and 5000 BC. It has since spread around the world and become a <a href="/wiki/Staple_food" title="Staple food">staple crop</a> in many countries.</p><p>The earliest archaeologically verified potato tuber remains have been found at the coastal site of <a href="/wiki/Ancon_(archaeological_site)" title="Ancon (archaeological site)">Ancon</a> (central <a href="/wiki/Peru" title="Peru">Peru</a>), dating to 2500 BC.</p><p>According to conservative estimates, the introduction of the potato was responsible for a quarter of the growth in <a href="/wiki/Old_World" title="Old World">Old World</a> population and urbanization between 1700 and 1900. Following the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_conquest_of_the_Inca_Empire" title="Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire">Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire</a>, the Spanish introduced the potato to Europe in the second half of the 16th century. The staple was subsequently conveyed by European mariners to territories and ports throughout the world. The potato was slow to be adopted by distrustful European farmers, but soon enough it became an important food staple and field crop that played a major role in the European 19th century population boom. However, lack of genetic diversity, due to the very limited number of varieties initially introduced, left the crop vulnerable to disease. In 1845, a plant disease known as late blight, caused by the fungus-like <a href="/wiki/Oomycete" title="Oomycete">oomycete</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Phytophthora_infestans" title="Phytophthora infestans">Phytophthora infestans</a></i>, spread rapidly through the poorer communities of western Ireland, resulting in the crop failures that led to the <a href="/wiki/Great_Irish_Famine" class="mw-redirect" title="Great Irish Famine">Great Irish Famine</a>. Thousands of varieties still persist in the Andes however, where over 100 cultivars might be found in a single valley, and a dozen or more might be maintained by a single agricultural household.</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization_of_the_United_Nations" class="mw-redirect" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations">Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations</a> reports that the world production of potatoes in 2013 was about 368 million tonnes. Just over two thirds of the global production is eaten directly by humans with the rest being fed to animals or used to produce starch. This means that the annual diet of an average global citizen in the first decade of the 21st century included about 33&#xA0;kg (or 73&#xA0;lb) of potato. However, the local importance of potato is extremely variable and rapidly changing. It remains an essential crop in Europe (especially eastern and central Europe), where per capita production is still the highest in the world, but the most rapid expansion over the past few decades has occurred in southern and eastern Asia. As of 2007, China led the world in potato production, and nearly a third of the world&apos;s potatoes were harvested in China and India. The geographic shift of potato production has been away from wealthier countries toward lower-income areas of the world, although the degree of this trend is ambiguous.</p><p>In 2008, several international organizations highlighted the potato&apos;s role in world food production, in the face of developing economic problems. They cited its potential derived from its status as a cheap and plentiful crop that grows in a wide variety of climates and locales.</p><p>Due to perishability, only about 5% of the world&apos;s potato crop is traded internationally; its minimal presence in world financial markets contributed to its stable pricing during the <a href="/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_world_food_price_crisis" class="mw-redirect" title="2007&#x2013;2008 world food price crisis">2007&#x2013;2008 world food price crisis</a>. Thus, the United Nations officially declared 2008 as the <i><a href="/wiki/International_Year_of_the_Potato" title="International Year of the Potato">International Year of the Potato</a></i>, to raise its profile in developing nations, calling the crop a &quot;hidden treasure&quot;. This followed the International Rice Year in 2004.</p><p>The potato contains <a href="/wiki/Vitamin" title="Vitamin">vitamins</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dietary_mineral" class="mw-redirect" title="Dietary mineral">minerals</a>, as well as an assortment of <a href="/wiki/Phytochemical" title="Phytochemical">phytochemicals</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Carotenoid" title="Carotenoid">carotenoids</a> and natural phenols. <a href="/wiki/Chlorogenic_acid" title="Chlorogenic acid">Chlorogenic acid</a> constitutes up to 90% of the potato tuber natural phenols.

The predominant form of this carbohydrate is <a href="/wiki/Starch" title="Starch">starch</a>. A small but significant portion of this starch is resistant to digestion by <a href="/wiki/Enzyme" title="Enzyme">enzymes</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Stomach" title="Stomach">stomach</a> and <a href="/wiki/Small_intestine" title="Small intestine">small intestine</a>, and so reaches the <a href="/wiki/Large_intestine" title="Large intestine">large intestine</a> essentially intact. This <a href="/wiki/Resistant_starch" title="Resistant starch">resistant starch</a> is considered to have similar physiological effects and health benefits as <a href="/wiki/Dietary_fiber" title="Dietary fiber">fiber</a>: It provides bulk, offers protection against <a href="/wiki/Colon_cancer" class="mw-redirect" title="Colon cancer">colon cancer</a>, improves <a href="/wiki/Glucose" title="Glucose">glucose</a> tolerance and insulin sensitivity, lowers plasma cholesterol and <a href="/wiki/Triglyceride" title="Triglyceride">triglyceride</a> concentrations, increases satiety, and possibly even reduces fat storage. The amount of resistant starch in potatoes depends much on preparation methods. Cooking and then cooling potatoes significantly increases resistant starch. For example, cooked <a href="/wiki/Potato_starch" title="Potato starch">potato starch</a> contains about 7% resistant starch, which increases to about 13% upon cooling.</p><p>The storage and cooking method used can significantly affect the nutrient availability of the potato.</p><p>Potatoes are often broadly classified as high on the <a href="/wiki/Glycemic_index" title="Glycemic index">glycemic index</a> (GI) and so are often excluded from the diets of individuals trying to follow a <a href="/wiki/Low-glycemic_index_diet" class="mw-redirect" title="Low-glycemic index diet">low-GI diet</a>. In fact, the GI of potatoes can vary considerably depending on type (such as red, <a href="/wiki/Russet_Burbank_potato" title="Russet Burbank potato">russet</a>, white, or <a href="/wiki/King_Edward_potato" title="King Edward potato">King Edward</a>), origin (where it was grown), preparation methods (i.e., cooking method, whether it is eaten hot or cold, whether it is mashed or cubed or consumed whole, etc.), and with what it is consumed (i.e., the addition of various high-fat or high-protein toppings).</p><p>In the UK, potatoes are not considered by the <a href="/wiki/National_Health_Service" title="National Health Service">NHS</a> as counting towards the recommended daily <a href="/wiki/5_A_Day" title="5 A Day">five portions of fruit and vegetables</a>.</p><p>The following table shows the nutrient content of potato and other major staple foods, each in respective raw form. Staple foods are not commonly eaten raw and are usually sprouted or cooked before eating. In sprouted and cooked form, the relative nutritional and anti-nutritional contents of each of these grains may be different from the values reported in this table.</p><p>Potatoes contain toxic compounds known as <a href="/wiki/Glycoalkaloid" title="Glycoalkaloid">glycoalkaloids</a>, of which the most prevalent are <a href="/wiki/Solanine" title="Solanine">solanine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chaconine" title="Chaconine">chaconine</a>. Solanine is also found in other plants in the family <a href="/wiki/Solanaceae" title="Solanaceae">Solanaceae</a>, which includes such plants as the deadly nightshade (<i><a href="/wiki/Atropa_belladonna" title="Atropa belladonna">Atropa belladonna</a></i>), henbane (<i><a href="/wiki/Hyoscyamus_niger" title="Hyoscyamus niger">Hyoscyamus niger</a></i>), tobacco (<i><a href="/wiki/Nicotiana" title="Nicotiana">Nicotiana</a></i>), as well as eggplant and tomato.</p><p>These compounds, which protect the plant from its predators, are, in general, concentrated in its leaves, stems, sprouts, and fruits. In a summary of several studies, the glycoalkaloid content was highest in flowers and sprouts and lowest in the tuber flesh (in order from highest to lowest content, generally: flowers, sprouts, leaves, skin, roots, berries, peel [skin plus outer cortex of tuber flesh], stems, and tuber flesh). Exposure to light, physical damage, and age increase glycoalkaloid content within the tuber. Cooking at high temperatures&#x2014;over 170&#xA0;&#xB0;C (338&#xA0;&#xB0;F)&#x2014;partly destroys these. The concentration of glycoalkaloid in wild potatoes suffices to produce toxic effects in humans. Glycoalkaloids may cause headaches, <a href="/wiki/Diarrhea" title="Diarrhea">diarrhea</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cramps" class="mw-redirect" title="Cramps">cramps</a>, and in severe cases coma and death; however, poisoning from potatoes occurs very rarely. Light exposure causes greening from <a href="/wiki/Chlorophyll" title="Chlorophyll">chlorophyll</a> synthesis, thus giving a visual clue as to areas of the tuber that may have become more toxic; however, this does not provide a definitive guide, as greening and glycoalkaloid accumulation can occur independently of each other. Varieties contain different levels of glycoalkaloids. <a href="/wiki/Lenape_(potato)" title="Lenape (potato)">Lenape</a> was released in 1967 but was withdrawn in 1970 as it contained high levels of glycoalkaloids. Since then breeders developing new varieties test for this, and sometimes have to discard an otherwise promising <a href="/wiki/Cultivar" title="Cultivar">cultivar</a>.</p><p>Breeders try to keep solanine levels below 200&#xA0;mg/kg (200 ppmw). However, when these commercial varieties turn green, they can still approach concentrations of solanine of 1000&#xA0;mg/kg (1000 ppmw). In normal potatoes, analysis has shown solanine levels may be as little as 3.5% of the breeders&apos; maximum, with 7&#x2013;187&#xA0;mg/kg being found. While a normal potato has 12&#x2013;20&#xA0;mg/kg of glycoalkaloid content, a green tuber contains 250&#x2013;280&#xA0;mg/kg, and green skin 1500&#x2013;2200&#xA0;mg/kg.</p><p>The U.S. National Toxicology Program suggests that the average American consume at most 12.5&#xA0;mg/day of solanine from potatoes (the toxic dose is actually several times this, depending on body weight). Douglas L. Holt, the State Extension Specialist for Food Safety at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Missouri" title="University of Missouri">University of Missouri</a>, notes that no reported cases of potato-source solanine poisoning have occurred in the U.S. in the last 50&#xA0;years, and most cases involved eating green potatoes or drinking potato-leaf tea.</p><p>Potatoes are generally grown from seed potatoes &#x2013; these are tubers specifically grown to be disease free and provide consistent and healthy plants. To be disease free, the areas where seed potatoes are grown are selected with care. In the USA this restricts production of seed potatoes to only 15 states out of the 50 states that grow potatoes. These locations are selected for their cold hard winters that kill pests and long sunshine hours in the summer for optimum growth. In the UK, most seed potatoes originate in <a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> in areas where westerly winds prevent aphid attack and thus prevent spread of potato virus <a href="/wiki/Pathogen" title="Pathogen">pathogens</a>. Potato growth has been divided into five phases. During the first phase, sprouts emerge from the seed potatoes and root growth begins. During the second, <a href="/wiki/Photosynthesis" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> begins as the plant develops leaves and branches. In the third phase <a href="/wiki/Stolon" title="Stolon">stolons</a> develop from lower leaf <a href="/wiki/Axil" class="mw-redirect" title="Axil">axils</a> on the stem and grow downwards into the ground and on these stolons new tubers develop as swellings of the stolon. This phase is often (but not always) associated with flowering. Tuber formation halts when soil temperatures reach 27&#xA0;&#xB0;C (81&#xA0;&#xB0;F); hence potatoes are considered a cool-season crop. Tuber bulking occurs during the fourth phase, when the plant begins investing the majority of its resources in its newly formed tubers. At this stage, several factors are critical to yield: optimal soil moisture and temperature, soil nutrient availability and balance, and resistance to pest attacks. The final phase is maturation: The plant canopy dies back, the tuber skins harden, and their sugars convert to starches.</p><p>New tubers may arise at the soil surface. Since exposure to light leads to greening of the skins and the development of solanine, growers are interested in covering such tubers. Commercial growers usually address this problem by piling additional soil around the base of the plant as it grows (&quot;hilling&quot;, or in British English &quot;earthing up&quot;). An alternative method used by home gardeners and smaller-scale growers involves covering the growing area with organic <a href="/wiki/Mulch" title="Mulch">mulches</a> such as straw or with plastic sheets.</p><p>Correct potato husbandry can be an arduous task in some circumstances. Good ground preparation, <a href="/wiki/Harrowing" class="mw-redirect" title="Harrowing">harrowing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Plough" title="Plough">plowing</a>, and rolling are always needed, along with a little grace from the weather and a good source of water. Three successive plowings, with associated harrowing and rolling, are desirable before planting. Eliminating all root-weeds is desirable in potato cultivation. In general, the potatoes themselves are grown from the eyes of another potato and not from seed. Home gardeners often plant a piece of potato with two or three eyes in a hill of mounded soil. Commercial growers plant potatoes as a row crop using seed tubers, young plants or microtubers and may mound the entire row. Seed potato crops are &apos;rogued&apos; in some countries to eliminate diseased plants or those of a different variety from the seed crop.</p><p>Potatoes are sensitive to heavy <a href="/wiki/Frost" title="Frost">frosts</a>, which damage them in the ground. Even cold weather makes potatoes more susceptible to bruising and possibly later rotting, which can quickly ruin a large stored crop.</p><p>At harvest time, gardeners usually dig up potatoes with a long-handled, three-prong &quot;grape&quot; (or graip), i.e., a <a href="/wiki/Spading_fork" class="mw-redirect" title="Spading fork">spading fork</a>, or a potato hook, which is similar to the graip but with tines at a 90<a href="/wiki/Degree_(angle)" title="Degree (angle)">&#xB0;</a> angle to the handle. In larger plots, the plow is the fastest implement for unearthing potatoes. Commercial harvesting is typically done with large <a href="/wiki/Potato_harvester" title="Potato harvester">potato harvesters</a>, which scoop up the plant and surrounding earth. This is transported up an apron chain consisting of steel links several feet wide, which separates some of the dirt. The chain deposits into an area where further separation occurs. Different designs use different systems at this point. The most complex designs use vine choppers and shakers, along with a blower system to separate the potatoes from the plant. The result is then usually run past workers who continue to sort out plant material, stones, and rotten potatoes before the potatoes are continuously delivered to a wagon or truck. Further inspection and separation occurs when the potatoes are unloaded from the field vehicles and put into storage.</p><p>Immature potatoes may be sold as &quot;new potatoes&quot;<span id="new_potatoes"></span> and are particularly valued for taste. These are often harvested by the home gardener or farmer by &quot;grabbling&quot;, i.e. pulling out the young tubers by hand while leaving the plant in place.</p><p>Potatoes are usually cured after harvest to improve skin-set. Skin-set is the process by which the skin of the potato becomes resistant to skinning damage. Potato tubers may be susceptible to skinning at harvest and suffer skinning damage during harvest and handling operations. Curing allows the skin to fully set and any wounds to heal. Wound-healing prevents infection and water-loss from the tubers during storage. Curing is normally done at relatively warm temperatures 50 to 60&#xA0;&#xB0;F (10 to 16&#xA0;&#xB0;C) with high humidity and good gas-exchange if at all possible.</p><p>Storage facilities need to be carefully designed to keep the potatoes alive and slow the natural process of decomposition, which involves the breakdown of starch. It is crucial that the storage area is dark, well ventilated and for long-term storage maintained at temperatures near 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C (39&#xA0;&#xB0;F). For short-term storage before cooking, temperatures of about 7 to 10&#xA0;&#xB0;C (45 to 50&#xA0;&#xB0;F) are preferred.</p><p>On the other hand, temperatures below 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C (39&#xA0;&#xB0;F) convert potatoes&apos; starch into sugar, which alters their taste and cooking qualities and leads to higher <a href="/wiki/Acrylamide" title="Acrylamide">acrylamide</a> levels in the cooked product, especially in deep-fried dishes&#x2014;the discovery of acrylamides in starchy foods in 2002 has led to many international health concerns as they are believed to be possible carcinogens and their occurrence in cooked foods is currently under study as a possible influence in potential health problems.</p><p>Under optimum conditions possible in commercial warehouses, potatoes can be stored for up to ten to twelve months. When stored in homes, the shelf life is usually only a few weeks. If potatoes develop green areas or start to sprout, these areas should be trimmed before using. Trimming or peeling green areas are inadequate to remove copresent toxins, and such potatoes are no longer suitable as animal food.</p><p>Commercial storage of potatoes involves several phases: drying of surface moisture; a wound healing phase at 85% to 95% <a href="/wiki/Relative_humidity" title="Relative humidity">relative humidity</a> and temperatures below 25&#xA0;&#xB0;C (77&#xA0;&#xB0;F); a staged cooling phase; a holding phase; and a reconditioning phase, during which the tubers are slowly warmed.

The average world farm yield for potato was 17.4 tonnes per hectare, in 2010. Potato farms in the United States were the most productive in 2010, with a nationwide average of 44.3 tonnes per hectare. United Kingdom was a close second.</p><p><a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> farmers have demonstrated some of the best commercial yields in the world, ranging between 60 and 80 tonnes per hectare, some reporting yields of 88 tonnes potatoes per hectare.</p><p>There is a big gap among various countries between high and low yields, even with the same variety of potato. Average potato yields in developed economies ranges between 38&#x2013;44 tonnes per hectare. China and India accounted for over a third of world&apos;s production in 2010, and had yields of 14.7 and 19.9 tonnes per hectare respectively. The yield gap between farms in developing economies and developed economies represents an opportunity loss of over 400 million tonnes of potato, or an amount greater than 2010 world potato production. Potato crop yields are determined by factors such as the crop breed, seed age and quality, crop management practices and the plant environment. Improvements in one or more of these yield determinants, and a closure of the yield gap, can be a major boost to food supply and farmer incomes in the developing world.</p><p>While there are close to 4000 different varieties of potato, it has been bred into many standard or well-known varieties, each of which has particular agricultural or culinary attributes. In general, varieties are categorized into a few main groups, such as russets, reds, whites, yellows (also called Yukons) and purples&#x2014;based on common characteristics. Around 80 varieties are commercially available in the UK. For culinary purposes, varieties are often differentiated by their waxiness. Floury, or mealy (baking) potatoes have more starch (20&#x2013;22%) than waxy (boiling) potatoes (16&#x2013;18%). The distinction may also arise from variation in the comparative ratio of two potato starch compounds: <a href="/wiki/Amylose" title="Amylose">amylose</a> and <a href="/wiki/Amylopectin" title="Amylopectin">amylopectin</a>. Amylose, a long-chain molecule, diffuses from the starch granule when cooked in water, and lends itself to dishes where the potato is mashed. Varieties that contain a slightly higher amylopectin content, a highly branched molecule, help the potato retain its shape when boiled.</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/European_Cultivated_Potato_Database" title="European Cultivated Potato Database">European Cultivated Potato Database</a> (ECPD) is an online collaborative database of potato variety descriptions, updated and maintained by the Scottish Agricultural Science Agency within the framework of the European Cooperative Programme for Crop Genetic Resources Networks (ECP/GR)&#x2014;which is run by the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI).</p><p>Popular varieties (<a href="/wiki/Cultivar" title="Cultivar">cultivars</a>) include:</p><p>The <b>blue</b> or <b>purple potato</b> originated in South America.

In 2010, the European Commission cleared the way for &apos;Amflora&apos; to be grown in the European Union for industrial purposes only&#x2014;not for food. Nevertheless, under EU rules, individual countries have the right to decide whether they will allow this potato to be grown on their territory. Commercial planting of &apos;Amflora&apos; was expected in the Czech Republic and Germany in the spring of 2010, and Sweden and the Netherlands in subsequent years. Another GM potato variety developed by BASF is &apos;Fortuna&apos; which was made resistant to <a href="/wiki/Phytophthora_infestans" title="Phytophthora infestans">late blight</a> by adding two resistance genes, blb1 and blb2, which originate from the Mexican wild potato Solanum bulbocastanum.
