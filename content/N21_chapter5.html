<p><b>Democracy</b>, or <b>democratic government</b>, is &quot;a system of <a href="/wiki/Forms_of_government" title="Forms of government">government</a> in which all the people of a <a href="/wiki/State_(polity)" title="State (polity)">state</a> or <a href="/wiki/Polity" title="Polity">polity</a> ... are involved in making decisions about its affairs, typically by voting to elect representatives to a parliament or similar assembly&quot;, as defined by the <a href="/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary" title="Oxford English Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>. Democracy is further defined as (a:) &quot;government by the people; especially&#xA0;: rule of the majority (b:) &quot;a government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised by them directly or indirectly through a system of representation usually involving periodically held free elections.&quot;</p>
<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Political_scientist" class="mw-redirect" title="Political scientist">political scientist</a> <a href="/wiki/Larry_Diamond" title="Larry Diamond">Larry Diamond</a>, it consists of four key elements: (a) A political system for choosing and replacing the government through free and fair elections; (b) The active <a href="/wiki/Participation_(decision_making)" title="Participation (decision making)">participation</a> of the people, as citizens, in politics and civic life; (c) Protection of the <a href="/wiki/Human_rights" title="Human rights">human rights</a> of all citizens, and (d) A <a href="/wiki/Rule_of_law" title="Rule of law">rule of law</a>, in which the laws and procedures apply equally to all citizens.</p>
<p>The term originates from the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greek" title="Ancient Greek">Greek</a> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#x3B4;&#x3B7;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3BA;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3AF;&#x3B1;</span> (<i><span lang="grc-Latn" xml:lang="grc-Latn">d&#x113;mokrat&#xED;a</span></i>) &quot;rule of the people&quot;, which was found from &#x3B4;&#x1FC6;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3C2; (<i>d&#xEA;mos</i>) &quot;people&quot; and &#x3BA;&#x3C1;&#x3AC;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2; (<i>kr&#xE1;tos</i>) &quot;power&quot; or &quot;rule&quot;, in the 5th century BC to denote the <a href="/wiki/Political_system" title="Political system">political systems</a> then existing in <a href="/wiki/Greek_city-state" class="mw-redirect" title="Greek city-state">Greek city-states</a>, notably <a href="/wiki/Classical_Athens" title="Classical Athens">Athens</a>; the term is an antonym to &#x1F00;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3BA;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3AF;&#x3B1; (<i>aristokrat&#xED;a</i>) &quot;rule of an elite&quot;. While theoretically these definitions are in opposition, in practice the distinction has been blurred historically. The political system of Classical Athens, for example, granted democratic citizenship to an elite class of free men and excluded slaves and women from political participation. In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship consisted of an elite class until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the <a href="/wiki/Suffrage" title="Suffrage">suffrage</a> movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. The English word dates to the 16th century, from the older <a href="/wiki/Middle_French" title="Middle French">Middle French</a> and <a href="/wiki/Middle_Latin" class="mw-redirect" title="Middle Latin">Middle Latin</a> equivalents.</p>
<p>Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by an individual, as in an <a href="/wiki/Absolute_monarchy" title="Absolute monarchy">absolute monarchy</a>, or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an <a href="/wiki/Oligarchy" title="Oligarchy">oligarchy</a>. Nevertheless, these oppositions, inherited from Greek philosophy, are now ambiguous because contemporary governments have mixed democratic, oligarchic, and monarchic elements. <a href="/wiki/Karl_Popper" title="Karl Popper">Karl Popper</a> defined democracy in contrast to <a href="/wiki/Dictatorship" title="Dictatorship">dictatorship</a> or tyranny, thus focusing on opportunities for the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a <a href="/wiki/Revolution" title="Revolution">revolution</a>.</p>

<p>No consensus exists on how to define democracy, but <a href="/wiki/Legal_equality" class="mw-redirect" title="Legal equality">legal equality</a>, <a href="/wiki/Political_freedom" title="Political freedom">political freedom</a> and rule of law have been identified as important characteristics. These principles are reflected in all eligible citizens being <a href="/wiki/Equality_before_the_law" title="Equality before the law">equal before the law</a> and having equal access to legislative processes. For example, in a <a href="/wiki/Representative_democracy" title="Representative democracy">representative democracy</a>, every vote has equal weight, no unreasonable restrictions can apply to anyone seeking to become a representative, and the freedom of its eligible citizens is secured by legitimised rights and liberties which are typically protected by a <a href="/wiki/Constitution" title="Constitution">constitution</a>. Other uses of &quot;democracy&quot; include that of <a href="/wiki/Direct_democracy" title="Direct democracy">direct democracy</a>.</p>
<p>One theory holds that democracy requires three fundamental principles: (1) upward control, i.e. sovereignty residing at the lowest levels of authority, (2) political equality, and (3) social norms by which individuals and institutions only consider acceptable acts that reflect the first two principles of upward control and political equality.</p>
<p>The term &quot;democracy&quot; is sometimes used as shorthand for <a href="/wiki/Liberal_democracy" title="Liberal democracy">liberal democracy</a>, which is a variant of representative democracy that may include elements such as <a href="/wiki/Political_pluralism" class="mw-redirect" title="Political pluralism">political pluralism</a>; equality before the law; the <a href="/wiki/Right_to_petition" title="Right to petition">right to petition</a> elected officials for redress of grievances; <a href="/wiki/Due_process" title="Due process">due process</a>; <a href="/wiki/Civil_liberties" title="Civil liberties">civil liberties</a>; <a href="/wiki/Human_rights" title="Human rights">human rights</a>; and elements of <a href="/wiki/Civil_society" title="Civil society">civil society</a> outside the government. <a href="/wiki/Roger_Scruton" title="Roger Scruton">Roger Scruton</a> argues that democracy alone cannot provide personal and political freedom unless the institutions of <a href="/wiki/Civil_society" title="Civil society">civil society</a> are also present.</p>
<p>In some countries, notably in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> which originated the <a href="/wiki/Westminster_system" title="Westminster system">Westminster system</a>, the dominant principle is that of <a href="/wiki/Parliamentary_sovereignty" title="Parliamentary sovereignty">parliamentary sovereignty</a>, while maintaining <a href="/wiki/Judicial_independence" title="Judicial independence">judicial independence</a>. In the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="/wiki/Separation_of_powers" title="Separation of powers">separation of powers</a> is often cited as a central attribute. In <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>, parliamentary sovereignty is subject to the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_India" title="Constitution of India">Constitution of India</a> which includes <a href="/wiki/Judicial_review" title="Judicial review">judicial review</a>. Though the term &quot;democracy&quot; is typically used in the context of a <a href="/wiki/State_(polity)" title="State (polity)">political state</a>, the principles also are applicable to private <a href="/wiki/Organisation" class="mw-redirect" title="Organisation">organisations</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Majority_rule" title="Majority rule">Majority rule</a> is often listed as a characteristic of democracy. Hence, democracy allows for <a href="/wiki/Minority_group" title="Minority group">political minorities</a> to be oppressed by the &quot;<a href="/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority" title="Tyranny of the majority">tyranny of the majority</a>&quot; in the absence of legal protections of individual or group rights. An essential part of an &quot;ideal&quot; representative democracy is competitive <a href="/wiki/Elections" class="mw-redirect" title="Elections">elections</a> that are substantively and procedurally &quot;<a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fair" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:fair">fair</a>,&quot; i.e., <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/just" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:just">just</a> and <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/equitable" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:equitable">equitable</a>. In some countries, <a href="/wiki/Freedom_(political)" class="mw-redirect" title="Freedom (political)">freedom of political expression</a>, <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_speech" title="Freedom of speech">freedom of speech</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press" title="Freedom of the press">freedom of the press</a> are considered important to ensure that voters are well informed enabling them to vote according to their own interests.</p>
<p>It has also been suggested that a basic feature of democracy is the capacity of all voters to participate freely and fully in the life of their society. With its emphasis on notions of <a href="/wiki/Social_contract" title="Social contract">social contract</a> and the collective will of all the voters, democracy can also be characterised as a form of political <a href="/wiki/Collectivism" title="Collectivism">collectivism</a> because it is defined as a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in lawmaking.</p>
<p>While representative democracy is sometimes equated with the republican form of government, the term &quot;<a href="/wiki/Republic" title="Republic">republic</a>&quot; classically has encompassed both democracies and <a href="/wiki/Aristocracy" title="Aristocracy">aristocracies</a>. Many democracies are <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchies</a>, such as the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>.</p>

<a href="/wiki/Cleisthenes" title="Cleisthenes">Cleisthenes</a>, &quot;father of <a href="/wiki/Athenian_democracy" title="Athenian democracy">Athenian democracy</a>&quot;, modern bust</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The term &quot;democracy&quot; first appeared in ancient Greek political and philosophical thought in the city-state of <a href="/wiki/Athens" title="Athens">Athens</a> during <a href="/wiki/Classical_antiquity" title="Classical antiquity">classical antiquity</a>. Led by <a href="/wiki/Cleisthenes" title="Cleisthenes">Cleisthenes</a>, Athenians established what is generally held as the first democracy in 508&#x2013;507 BC. Cleisthenes is referred to as &quot;the father of <a href="/wiki/Athenian_democracy" title="Athenian democracy">Athenian democracy</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>Athenian democracy took the form of a direct democracy, and it had two distinguishing features: the <a href="/wiki/Sortition" title="Sortition">random selection</a> of ordinary citizens to fill the few existing government administrative and judicial offices, and a legislative assembly consisting of all Athenian citizens. All eligible citizens were allowed to speak and vote in the assembly, which set the laws of the city state. However, Athenian citizenship excluded <a href="/wiki/Woman" title="Woman">women</a>, <a href="/wiki/Slavery" title="Slavery">slaves</a>, foreigners (&#x3BC;&#x3AD;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3B9; / <i>m&#xE9;toikoi</i>), non-landowners, and males under 20 years old.</p>
<p>Of the estimated 200,000 to 400,000 inhabitants of Athens, there were between 30,000 and 60,000 citizens. The exclusion of large parts of the population from the citizen body is closely related to the ancient understanding of citizenship. In most of antiquity the benefit of citizenship was tied to the obligation to fight war campaigns.</p>
<p>Athenian democracy was not only <i>direct</i> in the sense that decisions were made by the assembled people, but also the <i>most direct</i> in the sense that the people through the assembly, boule and courts of law controlled the entire political process and a large proportion of citizens were involved constantly in the public business. Even though the rights of the individual were not secured by the Athenian constitution in the modern sense (the ancient Greeks had no word for &quot;rights&quot;), the Athenians enjoyed their liberties not in opposition to the government but by living in a city that was not subject to another power and by not being subjects themselves to the rule of another person.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Range_voting" title="Range voting">Range voting</a> appeared in <a href="/wiki/Sparta" title="Sparta">Sparta</a> as early as 700 BC. The <a href="/wiki/Apella" title="Apella">Apella</a> was an assembly of the people, held once a month, in which every male citizen of age 30 and above could participate. In the Apella, Spartans elected leaders and cast votes by range voting and shouting. <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> called this &quot;childish&quot;, as compared with the stone voting ballots used by the Athenians. Sparta adopted it because of its simplicity, and to prevent any bias voting, buying, or cheating that was predominant in the early democratic elections.</p>
<p>Even though the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Republic" title="Roman Republic">Roman Republic</a> contributed significantly to many aspects of democracy, only a minority of Romans were citizens with votes in elections for representatives. The votes of the powerful were given more weight through a system of <a href="/wiki/Gerrymandering" title="Gerrymandering">gerrymandering</a>, so most high officials, including members of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Senate" title="Roman Senate">Senate</a>, came from a few wealthy and noble families. In addition, the Roman Republic was the first government in the western world to have a Republic as a nation-state, although it didn&apos;t have much of a democracy. The Romans invented the concept of classics and many works from Ancient Greece were preserved. Additionally, the Roman model of governance inspired many political thinkers over the centuries, and today&apos;s modern representative democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek models because it was a state in which supreme power was held by the people and their elected representatives, and which had an elected or nominated leader. Other cultures, such as the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Iroquoi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Iroquoi (page does not exist)">Iroquoi</a> Nation in the Americas between around 1450 and 1600 AD also developed a form of democratic society before they came in contact with the Europeans. This indicates that forms of democracy may have been invented in other societies around the world.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Middle_Ages">Middle Ages</span></h3>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, there were various systems involving elections or assemblies, although often only involving a small part of the population. These included:</p>

<p>Most regions in medieval Europe were ruled by clergy or feudal lords.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Kouroukan_Fouga" title="Kouroukan Fouga">Kouroukan Fouga</a> divided the <a href="/wiki/Mali_Empire" title="Mali Empire">Mali Empire</a> into ruling clans (lineages) that were represented at a great assembly called the <i>Gbara</i>. However, the charter made Mali more similar to a <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> than a <a href="/wiki/Democratic_republic" title="Democratic republic">democratic republic</a>. A little closer to modern democracy were the Cossack republics of Ukraine in the 16th and 17th centuries: <a href="/wiki/Cossack_Hetmanate" title="Cossack Hetmanate">Cossack Hetmanate</a> and <a href="/wiki/Zaporizhian_Sich" title="Zaporizhian Sich">Zaporizhian Sich</a>. The highest post &#x2013; the <a href="/wiki/Hetmans_of_Ukrainian_Cossacks" title="Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks">Hetman</a> &#x2013; was elected by the representatives from the country&apos;s districts.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_England" title="Parliament of England">Parliament of England</a> had its roots in the restrictions on the power of kings written into <a href="/wiki/Magna_Carta" title="Magna Carta">Magna Carta</a> (1215), which explicitly protected certain rights of the King&apos;s subjects and implicitly supported what became the English writ of <a href="/wiki/Habeas_corpus" title="Habeas corpus">habeas corpus</a>, safeguarding individual freedom against unlawful imprisonment with right to appeal.

The emergence of <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_England#The_emergence_of_parliament_as_an_institution" title="Parliament of England">petitioning</a> is some of the earliest evidence of parliament being used as a forum to address the general grievances of ordinary people.

<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Early_modern_period" title="Early modern period">early modern period</a>, the power of the Parliament of England continually increased. Passage of the <a href="/wiki/Petition_of_Right" title="Petition of Right">Petition of Right</a> in 1628 and <a href="/wiki/Habeas_Corpus_Act_1679" title="Habeas Corpus Act 1679">Habeas Corpus Act</a> in 1679 established certain liberties and remain in effect. The idea of a political party took form with groups freely debating rights to political representation during the <a href="/wiki/Putney_Debates" title="Putney Debates">Putney Debates</a> of 1647. After the <a href="/wiki/English_Civil_War" title="English Civil War">English Civil Wars</a> (1642&#x2013;1651) and the <a href="/wiki/Glorious_Revolution" title="Glorious Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> of 1688, the <a href="/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_1689" title="Bill of Rights 1689">Bill of Rights</a> was enacted in 1689, which codified certain rights and liberties, and is still in effect. The Bill set out the requirement for regular elections, rules for freedom of speech in Parliament and limited the power of the monarch, ensuring that, unlike much of Europe at the time, <a href="/wiki/Royal_absolutism" class="mw-redirect" title="Royal absolutism">royal absolutism</a> would not prevail.</p>
<p>In North America, representative government began in <a href="/wiki/Jamestown,_Virginia" title="Jamestown, Virginia">Jamestown, Virginia</a>, with the election of the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Burgesses" title="House of Burgesses">House of Burgesses</a> (forerunner of the <a href="/wiki/Virginia_General_Assembly" title="Virginia General Assembly">Virginia General Assembly</a>) in 1619. English Puritans who migrated from 1620 established colonies in New England whose local governance was democratic and which contributed to the democratic development of the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>; although these local assemblies had some small amounts of devolved power, the ultimate authority was held by the Crown and the English Parliament.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/First_Parliament_of_Great_Britain" title="First Parliament of Great Britain">first Parliament of Great Britain</a> was established in 1707, after the merger of the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_England" title="Kingdom of England">Kingdom of England</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Scotland" title="Kingdom of Scotland">Kingdom of Scotland</a> under the <a href="/wiki/Acts_of_Union_1707" title="Acts of Union 1707">Acts of Union</a>. Although the monarch increasingly became a <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy" title="Constitutional monarchy">figurehead</a>, only a small minority actually had a voice; Parliament was elected by only a few percent of the population (less than 3% as late as 1780).

<p>The creation of the short-lived <a href="/wiki/Corsican_Republic" title="Corsican Republic">Corsican Republic</a> in 1755 marked the first nation in modern history to adopt a democratic <a href="/wiki/Constitution" title="Constitution">constitution</a> (all men and women above age of 25 could vote). This <a href="/wiki/Corsican_Constitution" title="Corsican Constitution">Corsican Constitution</a> was the first based on <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" title="Age of Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> principles and included <a href="/wiki/Female_suffrage" class="mw-redirect" title="Female suffrage">female suffrage</a>, something that was not granted in most other democracies until the 20th century.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Colonial_history_of_the_United_States" title="Colonial history of the United States">American colonial period before 1776</a>, and for some time after, often only adult white male property owners could vote; enslaved Africans, most free black people and most women were not extended the franchise. On the <a href="/wiki/Frontier_Thesis" title="Frontier Thesis">American frontier</a>, democracy became a way of life, with more widespread social, economic and political equality. Although not described as a democracy by the <a href="/wiki/Founding_fathers_of_the_united_states" class="mw-redirect" title="Founding fathers of the united states">founding fathers</a>, they shared a determination to root the American experiment in the principles of natural freedom and equality.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/American_Revolution" title="American Revolution">American Revolution</a> led to the adoption of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Constitution" title="United States Constitution">United States Constitution</a> in 1787, the oldest surviving, still active, governmental <a href="/wiki/Codified_constitution" class="mw-redirect" title="Codified constitution">codified constitution</a>. The Constitution provided for an elected government and protected civil rights and liberties for some, but did not end <a href="/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States" title="Slavery in the United States">slavery</a> nor extend <a href="/wiki/Voting_rights_in_the_United_States" title="Voting rights in the United States">voting rights in the United States</a> beyond white male property owners (about 6% of the population). The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights" title="United States Bill of Rights">Bill of Rights</a> in 1791 set limits on government power to protect personal freedoms but had little impact on judgements by the courts for the first 130 years after ratification.</p>
<p>In 1789, <a href="/wiki/Revolutionary_France" class="mw-redirect" title="Revolutionary France">Revolutionary France</a> adopted the <a href="/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen" title="Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen">Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</a> and, although short-lived, the <a href="/wiki/National_Convention" title="National Convention">National Convention</a> was elected by all males in 1792. However, in the early 19th century, little of democracy - as theory, practice, or even as word - remained in the North Atlantic world.</p>
<p>During this period, <a href="/wiki/Slavery" title="Slavery">slavery</a> remained a social and economic institution in places around the world. This was particularly the case in the eleven states of the American South. A variety of organisations were established advocating the movement of black people from the United States to locations where they would enjoy greater freedom and equality.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Slave_Trade_Act_1807" title="Slave Trade Act 1807">Slave Trade Act 1807</a> banned the trade across the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>, which was <a href="/wiki/Blockade_of_Africa" title="Blockade of Africa">enforced internationally</a> by the Royal Navy under treaties Britain negotiated with other nations. As the voting franchise in the U.K. was increased, it also was made more uniform in a series of reforms beginning with the <a href="/wiki/Reform_Act_of_1832" class="mw-redirect" title="Reform Act of 1832">Reform Act of 1832</a>. In 1833, the United Kingdom passed the <a href="/wiki/Slavery_Abolition_Act" class="mw-redirect" title="Slavery Abolition Act">Slavery Abolition Act</a> which took effect across the British Empire.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Universal_suffrage" title="Universal suffrage">Universal male suffrage</a> was established in <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a> in March 1848 in the wake of the <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution_of_1848" title="French Revolution of 1848">French Revolution of 1848</a>. In 1848, several <a href="/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848" title="Revolutions of 1848">revolutions broke out in Europe</a> as rulers were confronted with popular demands for liberal constitutions and more democratic government.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/1860_United_States_Census" title="1860 United States Census">1860 United States Census</a>, the slave population in the United States had grown to four million, and in <a href="/wiki/Reconstruction_era_of_the_United_States" class="mw-redirect" title="Reconstruction era of the United States">Reconstruction</a> after the Civil War (late 1860s), the newly <a href="/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States" title="Abolitionism in the United States">freed slaves</a> became citizens with a nominal right to vote for men. Full enfranchisement of citizens was not secured until after the <a href="/wiki/African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1955%E2%80%931968)" class="mw-redirect" title="African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955&#x2013;1968)">African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955&#x2013;1968)</a> gained passage by the United States Congress of the <a href="/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965" title="Voting Rights Act of 1965">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a>.</p>

<p>20th-century transitions to liberal democracy have come in successive &quot;waves of democracy&quot;, variously resulting from wars, revolutions, <a href="/wiki/Decolonisation" class="mw-redirect" title="Decolonisation">decolonisation</a>, and religious and economic circumstances. <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> and the dissolution of the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_empire" class="mw-redirect" title="Ottoman empire">Ottoman</a> and <a href="/wiki/Austria-Hungary" title="Austria-Hungary">Austro-Hungarian</a> empires resulted in the creation of new nation-states from Europe, most of them at least nominally democratic.</p>
<p>In the 1920s democracy flourished and <a href="/wiki/Timeline_of_women%27s_suffrage" title="Timeline of women&apos;s suffrage">women&apos;s suffrage</a> advanced, but the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> brought disenchantment and most of the countries of Europe, Latin America, and Asia turned to strong-man rule or dictatorships. <a href="/wiki/Fascism" title="Fascism">Fascism</a> and dictatorships flourished in <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a> and <a href="/wiki/Portugal" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>, as well as nondemocratic regimes in the <a href="/wiki/Baltics" class="mw-redirect" title="Baltics">Baltics</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Balkans" title="Balkans">Balkans</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>, among others.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> brought a definitive reversal of this trend in western Europe. The <a href="/wiki/Democratisation" class="mw-redirect" title="Democratisation">democratisation</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Allied_Control_Council" title="Allied Control Council">American, British, and French sectors of occupied Germany</a> (disputed), Austria, Italy, and the <a href="/wiki/Occupied_Japan" class="mw-redirect" title="Occupied Japan">occupied Japan</a> served as a model for the later theory of <a href="/wiki/Regime_change" title="Regime change">regime change</a>. However, most of <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Europe" title="Eastern Europe">Eastern Europe</a>, including the <a href="/wiki/German_Democratic_Republic" class="mw-redirect" title="German Democratic Republic">Soviet sector of Germany</a> fell into the non-democratic <a href="/wiki/Soviet_bloc" class="mw-redirect" title="Soviet bloc">Soviet bloc</a>.</p>
<p>The war was followed by <a href="/wiki/Decolonisation" class="mw-redirect" title="Decolonisation">decolonisation</a>, and again most of the new independent states had nominally democratic constitutions. <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a> emerged as the world&apos;s largest democracy and continues to be so. Countries that were once part of the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> often adopted the British <a href="/wiki/Westminster_system" title="Westminster system">Westminster system</a>.</p>
<p>By 1960, the vast majority of country-states were nominally democracies, although most of the world&apos;s populations lived in nations that experienced sham elections, and other forms of subterfuge (particularly in Communist nations and the former colonies.)</p>
<p>A subsequent wave of <a href="/wiki/Democratisation" class="mw-redirect" title="Democratisation">democratisation</a> brought substantial gains toward true liberal democracy for many nations. <a href="/wiki/Spanish_democratic_transition" class="mw-redirect" title="Spanish democratic transition">Spain</a>, <a href="/wiki/Portuguese_transition_to_democracy" title="Portuguese transition to democracy">Portugal</a> (1974), and several of the military dictatorships in South America returned to civilian rule in the late 1970s and early 1980s (<a href="/wiki/Argentine_transition_to_democracy" class="mw-redirect" title="Argentine transition to democracy">Argentina in 1983</a>, <a href="/wiki/History_of_Bolivia" title="History of Bolivia">Bolivia</a>, <a href="/wiki/History_of_Uruguay" title="History of Uruguay">Uruguay in 1984</a>, <a href="/wiki/History_of_Brazil_(1985%E2%80%93present)" class="mw-redirect" title="History of Brazil (1985&#x2013;present)">Brazil in 1985</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Chilean_transition_to_democracy" title="Chilean transition to democracy">Chile in the early 1990s</a>). This was followed by nations in <a href="/wiki/East_Asia" title="East Asia">East</a> and <a href="/wiki/South_Asia" title="South Asia">South Asia</a> by the mid-to-late 1980s.</p>
<p>Economic malaise in the 1980s, along with resentment of Soviet oppression, contributed to the <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Soviet_Union_(1985-1991)" class="mw-redirect" title="History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)">collapse of the Soviet Union</a>, the associated end of the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, and the democratisation and <a href="/wiki/Liberalisation" class="mw-redirect" title="Liberalisation">liberalisation</a> of the former <a href="/wiki/Eastern_bloc" class="mw-redirect" title="Eastern bloc">Eastern bloc</a> countries. The most successful of the new democracies were those geographically and culturally closest to western Europe, and they are now members or candidate members of the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a>.</p>
<p>The liberal trend spread to some nations in Africa in the 1990s, most prominently in <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>. Some recent examples of attempts of liberalisation include the <a href="/wiki/Indonesian_Revolution_of_1998" class="mw-redirect" title="Indonesian Revolution of 1998">Indonesian Revolution of 1998</a>, the <a href="/wiki/5th_October_Overthrow" class="mw-redirect" title="5th October Overthrow">Bulldozer Revolution</a> in <a href="/wiki/Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia" class="mw-redirect" title="Federal Republic of Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Rose_Revolution" title="Rose Revolution">Rose Revolution</a> in <a href="/wiki/Georgia_(country)" title="Georgia (country)">Georgia</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Orange_Revolution" title="Orange Revolution">Orange Revolution</a> in <a href="/wiki/Ukraine" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Cedar_Revolution" title="Cedar Revolution">Cedar Revolution</a> in <a href="/wiki/Lebanon" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Tulip_Revolution" title="Tulip Revolution">Tulip Revolution</a> in <a href="/wiki/Kyrgyzstan" title="Kyrgyzstan">Kyrgyzstan</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/2010%E2%80%932011_Tunisian_revolution" class="mw-redirect" title="2010&#x2013;2011 Tunisian revolution">Jasmine Revolution</a> in <a href="/wiki/Tunisia" title="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>.</p>

<p>Democracy has taken a number of forms, both in theory and practice. Some varieties of democracy provide better representation and more freedom for their citizens than others. However, if any democracy is not structured so as to prohibit the government from excluding the people from the legislative process, or any branch of government from altering the <a href="/wiki/Separation_of_powers" title="Separation of powers">separation of powers</a> in its own favour, then a branch of the system can accumulate too much power and destroy the democracy.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Direct democracy is a political system where the citizens participate in the decision-making personally, contrary to relying on intermediaries or representatives. The use of a lot system, a characteristic of <a href="/wiki/Athenian_democracy" title="Athenian democracy">Athenian democracy</a>, is unique to direct democracies. In this system, important governmental and administrative tasks are performed by citizens picked from a lottery. A direct democracy gives the voting population the power to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Change constitutional laws,</li>
<li>Put forth <a href="/wiki/Initiative" title="Initiative">initiatives</a>, <a href="/wiki/Referendum" title="Referendum">referendums</a> and suggestions for laws,</li>
<li>Give binding orders to elective officials, such as revoking them before the end of their elected term, or initiating a lawsuit for breaking a campaign promise.</li>
</ol>
<p>Within modern-day representative governments, certain electoral tools like referendums, citizens&apos; initiatives and <a href="/wiki/Recall_election" title="Recall election">recall elections</a> are referred to as forms of direct democracy. Direct democracy as a government system currently only exists in the <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Swiss</a> <a href="/wiki/Cantons_of_Switzerland" title="Cantons of Switzerland">cantons</a> of <a href="/wiki/Appenzell_Innerrhoden" title="Appenzell Innerrhoden">Appenzell Innerrhoden</a> and <a href="/wiki/Canton_of_Glarus" title="Canton of Glarus">Glarus</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Representative">Representative</span></h4>

<p>Representative democracy involves the election of government officials by the people being represented. If the head of state is also <a href="/wiki/Democratically-elected_government" class="mw-redirect" title="Democratically-elected government">democratically elected</a> then it is called a democratic <a href="/wiki/Republic" title="Republic">republic</a>. The most common mechanisms involve election of the candidate with a majority or a <a href="/wiki/Plurality_(voting)" title="Plurality (voting)">plurality</a> of the votes. Most western countries have representative systems.</p>
<p>Representatives may be elected or become diplomatic representatives by a particular district (or <a href="/wiki/Constituency" class="mw-redirect" title="Constituency">constituency</a>), or represent the entire electorate through <a href="/wiki/Proportional_representation" title="Proportional representation">proportional</a> systems, with some using a combination of the two. Some representative democracies also incorporate elements of direct democracy, such as <a href="/wiki/Referendum" title="Referendum">referendums</a>. A characteristic of representative democracy is that while the representatives are elected by the people to act in the people&apos;s interest, they retain the freedom to exercise their own judgement as how best to do so. Such reasons have driven criticism upon representative democracy, pointing out the contradictions of representation mechanisms&apos; with democracy</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Parliamentary">Parliamentary</span></h5>

<p>Parliamentary democracy is a representative democracy where government is appointed by, or can be dismissed by, representatives as opposed to a &quot;presidential rule&quot; wherein the president is both head of state and the head of government and is elected by the voters. Under a parliamentary democracy, government is exercised by delegation to an executive ministry and subject to ongoing review, checks and balances by the legislative parliament elected by the people.</p>
<p>Parliamentary systems have the right to dismiss a Prime Minister at any point in time that they feel he or she is not doing their job to the expectations of the legislature. This is done through a Vote of No Confidence where the legislature decides whether or not to remove the Prime Minister from office by a majority support for his or her dismissal. In some countries, the Prime Minister can also call an election whenever he or she so chooses, and typically the Prime Minister will hold an election when he or she knows that they are in good favour with the public as to get re-elected. In other parliamentary democracies extra elections are virtually never held, a minority government being preferred until the next ordinary elections. An important feature of the parliamentary democracy is the concept of the &quot;loyal opposition&quot;. The essence of the concept is that the second largest political party (or coalition) opposes the governing party (or coalition), while still remaining loyal to the state and its democratic principles.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Presidential">Presidential</span></h5>

<p>Presidential Democracy is a system where the public elects the president through free and fair elections. The president serves as both the head of state and head of government controlling most of the executive powers. The president serves for a specific term and cannot exceed that amount of time. Elections typically have a fixed date and aren&apos;t easily changed. The president has direct control over the cabinet, specifically appointing the cabinet members.</p>
<p>The president cannot be easily removed from office by the legislature, but he or she cannot remove members of the legislative branch any more easily. This provides some measure of <a href="/wiki/Separation_of_powers" title="Separation of powers">separation of powers</a>. In consequence however, the president and the legislature may end up in the control of separate parties, allowing one to block the other and thereby interfere with the orderly operation of the state. This may be the reason why presidential democracy is not very common outside the Americas, Africa, and Central and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Semi-presidential_system" title="Semi-presidential system">semi-presidential system</a> is a system of democracy in which the government includes both a prime minister and a president. The particular powers held by the prime minister and president vary by country.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Hybrid_or_semi-direct">Hybrid or semi-direct</span></h4>

<p>Some modern democracies that are predominantly representative in nature also heavily rely upon forms of political action that are directly democratic. These democracies, which combine elements of representative democracy and direct democracy, are termed <i>hybrid democracies</i>, <i>semi-direct democracies</i> or <i>participatory democracies</i>. Examples include Switzerland and some <a href="/wiki/U.S._state" title="U.S. state">U.S. states</a>, where frequent use is made of <a href="/wiki/Referendum" title="Referendum">referendums</a> and <a href="/wiki/Initiatives" class="mw-redirect" title="Initiatives">initiatives</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Swiss_confederation" class="mw-redirect" title="Swiss confederation">Swiss confederation</a> is a semi-direct democracy. At the federal level, citizens can propose changes to the constitution (<a href="/wiki/Federal_popular_initiative" class="mw-redirect" title="Federal popular initiative">federal popular initiative</a>) or ask for a <a href="/wiki/Optional_referendum" title="Optional referendum">referendum</a> to be held on any law voted by the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Assembly_(Switzerland)" title="Federal Assembly (Switzerland)">parliament</a>. Between January 1995 and June 2005, Swiss citizens voted 31 times, to answer 103 questions (during the same period, French citizens participated in only two referendums). Although in the past 120 years less than 250 initiatives have been put to referendum. The populace has been conservative, approving only about 10% of the initiatives put before them; in addition, they have often opted for a version of the initiative rewritten by government.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, no mechanisms of direct democracy exists at the federal level, but over half of the <a href="/wiki/U.S._state" title="U.S. state">states</a> and many localities provide for citizen-sponsored ballot initiatives (also called &quot;ballot measures&quot;, &quot;ballot questions&quot; or &quot;propositions&quot;), and the vast majority of states allow for referendums. Examples include the extensive use of <a href="/wiki/Referendum" title="Referendum">referendums</a> in the US state of <a href="/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>, which is a state that has more than 20 million voters.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/New_England" title="New England">New England</a>, <a href="/wiki/Town_meeting" title="Town meeting">Town meetings</a> are often used, especially in rural areas, to manage local government. This creates a hybrid form of government, with a local <a href="/wiki/Direct_democracy" title="Direct democracy">direct democracy</a> and a state government which is representative. For example, most <a href="/wiki/Vermont" title="Vermont">Vermont</a> towns hold annual town meetings in March in which town officers are elected, budgets for the town and schools are voted on, and citizens have the opportunity to speak and be heard on political matters.</p>

</div>
<p>Many countries such as the United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, <a href="/wiki/Scandinavia" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavian countries</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thailand" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bhutan" title="Bhutan">Bhutan</a> turned powerful monarchs into constitutional monarchs with limited or, often gradually, merely symbolic roles. For example, in the predecessor states to the United Kingdom, constitutional monarchy began to emerge and has continued uninterrupted since the <a href="/wiki/Glorious_Revolution" title="Glorious Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> of 1688 and passage of the <a href="/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_1689" title="Bill of Rights 1689">Bill of Rights 1689</a>.</p>
<p>In other countries, the monarchy was abolished along with the aristocratic system (as in France, China, Russia, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Italy, Greece and Egypt). An elected president, with or without significant powers, became the head of state in these countries.</p>
<p>&#xC9;lite upper houses of legislatures, which often had lifetime or hereditary tenure, were common in many nations. Over time, these either had their powers limited (as with the British <a href="/wiki/House_of_Lords" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a>) or else became elective and remained powerful (as with the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Senate" title="Australian Senate">Australian Senate</a>).</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Republic">Republic</span></h4>

<p>The term <i><a href="/wiki/Republic" title="Republic">republic</a></i> has many different meanings, but today often refers to a representative democracy with an elected <a href="/wiki/Head_of_state" title="Head of state">head of state</a>, such as a <a href="/wiki/President" title="President">president</a>, serving for a limited term, in contrast to states with a hereditary <a href="/wiki/Monarch" title="Monarch">monarch</a> as a head of state, even if these states also are representative democracies with an elected or appointed <a href="/wiki/Head_of_government" title="Head of government">head of government</a> such as a <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister" class="mw-redirect" title="Prime Minister">prime minister</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States" title="Founding Fathers of the United States">Founding Fathers of the United States</a> rarely praised and often criticised democracy, which in their time tended to specifically mean direct democracy, often without the protection of a constitution enshrining basic rights; <a href="/wiki/James_Madison" title="James Madison">James Madison</a> argued, especially in <a href="/wiki/Federalist_No._10" title="Federalist No. 10"><i>The Federalist</i> No. 10</a>, that what distinguished a <i>democracy</i> from a <i>republic</i> was that the former became weaker as it got larger and suffered more violently from the effects of faction, whereas a republic could get stronger as it got larger and combats faction by its very structure.</p>
<p>What was critical to American values, <a href="/wiki/John_Adams" title="John Adams">John Adams</a> insisted, was that the government be &quot;bound by fixed laws, which the people have a voice in making, and a right to defend.&quot; As Benjamin Franklin was exiting after writing the U.S. constitution, a woman asked him &quot;Well, Doctor, what have we got&#x2014;a republic or a monarchy?&quot;. He replied &quot;A republic&#x2014;if you can keep it.&quot;</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Liberal_democracy">Liberal democracy</span></h4>

<p>A liberal democracy is a representative democracy in which the ability of the elected representatives to exercise decision-making power is subject to the <a href="/wiki/Rule_of_law" title="Rule of law">rule of law</a>, and moderated by a constitution or laws that emphasise the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals, and which places constraints on the leaders and on the extent to which the will of the majority can be exercised against the rights of minorities (see <a href="/wiki/Civil_liberties" title="Civil liberties">civil liberties</a>).</p>
<p>In a liberal democracy, it is possible for some large-scale decisions to <a href="/wiki/Emergent_democracy" title="Emergent democracy">emerge</a> from the many individual decisions that citizens are free to make. In other words, citizens can &quot;vote with their feet&quot; or &quot;vote with their dollars&quot;, resulting in significant informal government-by-the-masses that exercises many &quot;powers&quot; associated with formal government elsewhere.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Socialist">Socialist</span></h4>

<p>Within <a href="/wiki/Democracy_in_Marxist_theory" class="mw-redirect" title="Democracy in Marxist theory">Marxist orthodoxy</a> there is a hostility to what is commonly called &quot;liberal democracy&quot;, which they simply refer to as parliamentary democracy because of its often centralised nature.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Anarchist">Anarchist</span></h4>
<p>Anarchists are split in this domain, depending on whether they believe that a <a href="/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority" title="Tyranny of the majority">majority-rule is tyrannic or not</a>. The only form of democracy considered acceptable to many <a href="/wiki/Anarchism" title="Anarchism">anarchists</a> is direct democracy. <a href="/wiki/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon" title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> argued that the only acceptable form of direct democracy is one in which it is recognised that majority decisions are not binding on the minority, even when unanimous.

<p>Some anarcho-communists oppose the majoritarian nature of direct democracy, feeling that it can impede individual liberty and opt in favour of a non-majoritarian form of <a href="/wiki/Consensus_democracy" title="Consensus democracy">consensus democracy</a>, similar to Proudhon&apos;s position on direct democracy. <a href="/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau" title="Henry David Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a>, who did not self-identify as an anarchist but argued for &quot;a better government&quot; and is cited as an inspiration by some anarchists, argued that people should not be in the position of ruling others or being ruled when there is no consent.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Sortition">Sortition</span></h4>

<p>Sometimes called &quot;democracy without elections&quot;, <a href="/wiki/Sortition" title="Sortition">sortition</a> chooses decision makers via a random process. The intention is that those chosen will be representative of the opinions and interests of the people at large, and be more fair and impartial than an elected official. The technique was in widespread use in <a href="/wiki/Athenian_Democracy" class="mw-redirect" title="Athenian Democracy">Athenian Democracy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Florence" title="Republic of Florence">Renaissance Florence</a> and is still used in modern <a href="/wiki/Jury_selection" title="Jury selection">jury selection</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Consociational">Consociational</span></h4>

<p>A consociational democracy allows for simultaneous majority votes in two or more ethno-religious constituencies, and policies are enacted only if they gain majority support from both or all of them.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Consensus_democracy">Consensus democracy</span></h4>

<p>A consensus democracy, in contrast, would not be dichotomous. Instead, decisions would be based on a multi-option approach, and policies would be enacted if they gained sufficient support, either in a purely verbal agreement, or via a consensus vote - a multi-option preference vote. If the threshold of support were at a sufficiently high level, minorities would be as it were protected automatically. Furthermore, any voting would be ethno-colour blind.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Qualified_majority_voting" class="mw-redirect" title="Qualified majority voting">Qualified majority voting</a> is designed by the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Rome" title="Treaty of Rome">Treaty of Rome</a> to be the principal method of reaching decisions in the <a href="/wiki/European_Council_of_Ministers" class="mw-redirect" title="European Council of Ministers">European Council of Ministers</a>. This system allocates votes to member states in part according to their population, but heavily weighted in favour of the smaller states. This might be seen as a form of representative democracy, but representatives to the Council might be appointed rather than directly elected.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Inclusive">Inclusive</span></h4>


<p>Inclusive democracy is a political theory and political project that aims for <a href="/wiki/Direct_democracy" title="Direct democracy">direct democracy</a> in all fields of social life: political democracy in the form of face-to-face assemblies which are confederated, <a href="/wiki/Economic_democracy" title="Economic democracy">economic democracy</a> in a <a href="/wiki/Stateless_society" title="Stateless society">stateless</a>, moneyless and marketless economy, democracy in the social realm, i.e. <a href="/wiki/Workers%27_self-management" title="Workers&apos; self-management">self-management</a> in places of work and education, and ecological democracy which aims to reintegrate society and nature. The theoretical project of inclusive democracy emerged from the work of political philosopher <a href="/wiki/Takis_Fotopoulos" title="Takis Fotopoulos">Takis Fotopoulos</a> in &quot;Towards An Inclusive Democracy&quot; and was further developed in the journal <i><a href="/wiki/Democracy_%26_Nature" title="Democracy &amp; Nature">Democracy &amp; Nature</a></i> and its successor <i>The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy</i>.</p>
<p>The basic unit of decision making in an inclusive democracy is the demotic assembly, i.e. the assembly of demos, the citizen body in a given geographical area which may encompass a town and the surrounding villages, or even neighbourhoods of large cities. An inclusive democracy today can only take the form of a confederal democracy that is based on a network of administrative councils whose members or delegates are elected from popular face-to-face democratic assemblies in the various demoi. Thus, their role is purely administrative and practical, not one of policy-making like that of representatives in representative democracy.</p>
<p>The citizen body is advised by experts but it is the citizen body which functions as the ultimate decision-taker . Authority can be delegated to a segment of the citizen body to carry out specific duties, for example to serve as members of popular courts, or of regional and confederal councils. Such delegation is made, in principle, by lot, on a rotation basis, and is always recallable by the citizen body. Delegates to regional and confederal bodies should have specific mandates.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Participatory_politics">Participatory politics</span></h4>

<p>A <a href="/wiki/Parpolity" class="mw-redirect" title="Parpolity">Parpolity</a> or Participatory Polity is a theoretical form of democracy that is ruled by a <a href="/wiki/Parpolity" class="mw-redirect" title="Parpolity">Nested Council</a> structure. The guiding philosophy is that people should have decision making power in proportion to how much they are affected by the decision. Local councils of 25&#x2013;50 people are completely autonomous on issues that affect only them, and these councils send delegates to higher level councils who are again autonomous regarding issues that affect only the population affected by that council.</p>
<p>A council court of randomly chosen citizens serves as a check on the <a href="/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority" title="Tyranny of the majority">tyranny of the majority</a>, and rules on which body gets to vote on which issue. Delegates may vote differently from how their sending council might wish, but are mandated to communicate the wishes of their sending council. Delegates are recallable at any time. Referendums are possible at any time via votes of most lower-level councils, however, not everything is a referendum as this is most likely a waste of time. A parpolity is meant to work in tandem with a <a href="/wiki/Participatory_economy" class="mw-redirect" title="Participatory economy">participatory economy</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Cosmopolitan">Cosmopolitan</span></h4>

<p>Cosmopolitan democracy, also known as <i>Global democracy</i> or <i>World Federalism</i>, is a political system in which democracy is implemented on a global scale, either directly or through representatives. An important justification for this kind of system is that the decisions made in national or regional democracies often affect people outside the constituency who, by definition, cannot vote. By contrast, in a cosmopolitan democracy, the people who are affected by decisions also have a say in them.</p>
<p>According to its supporters, any attempt to solve global problems is undemocratic without some form of cosmopolitan democracy. The general principle of cosmopolitan democracy is to expand some or all of the values and norms of democracy, including the rule of law; the non-violent resolution of conflicts; and equality among citizens, beyond the limits of the state. To be fully implemented, this would require reforming existing <a href="/wiki/International_organisations" class="mw-redirect" title="International organisations">international organisations</a>, e.g. the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>, as well as the creation of new institutions such as a <a href="/wiki/World_Parliament" class="mw-redirect" title="World Parliament">World Parliament</a>, which ideally would enhance public control over, and accountability in, international politics.</p>
<p>Cosmopolitan Democracy has been promoted, among others, by physicist Albert Einstein, writer Kurt Vonnegut, columnist <a href="/wiki/George_Monbiot" title="George Monbiot">George Monbiot</a>, and professors <a href="/wiki/David_Held" title="David Held">David Held</a> and <a href="/wiki/Daniele_Archibugi" title="Daniele Archibugi">Daniele Archibugi</a>. The creation of the <a href="/wiki/International_Criminal_Court" title="International Criminal Court">International Criminal Court</a> in 2003 was seen as a major step forward by many supporters of this type of cosmopolitan democracy.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Creative_Democracy">Creative Democracy</span></h4>

<p>Creative Democracy is advocated by American philosopher <a href="/wiki/John_Dewey" title="John Dewey">John Dewey</a>. The main idea about Creative Democracy is that democracy encourages individual capacity building and the interaction among the society. Dewey argues that democracy is a way of life in his work of &quot;&quot;Creative Democracy: The Task Before Us&quot;  and an experience built on faith in human nature, faith in human beings, and faith in working with others. Democracy, in Dewey&apos;s view, is a <a href="/wiki/Morality" title="Morality">moral ideal</a> requiring actual effort and work by people; it is not an institutional concept that exists outside of ourselves. &quot;The task of democracy&quot;, Dewey concludes, &quot;is forever that of creation of a freer and more humane experience in which all share and to which all contribute&quot;.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Non-governmental">Non-governmental</span></h3>
<p>Aside from the public sphere, similar democratic principles and mechanisms of voting and representation have been used to govern other kinds of groups. Many <a href="/wiki/Non-governmental_organisation" class="mw-redirect" title="Non-governmental organisation">non-governmental organisations</a> decide policy and leadership by voting. Most <a href="/wiki/Trade_union" title="Trade union">trade unions</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cooperatives" class="mw-redirect" title="Cooperatives">cooperatives</a> are governed by democratic elections. <a href="/wiki/Corporation" title="Corporation">Corporations</a> are controlled by <a href="/wiki/Shareholder" title="Shareholder">shareholders</a> on the principle of <a href="/wiki/One_share,_one_vote" title="One share, one vote">one share, one vote</a>.

<p>For Aristotle the underlying principle of democracy is freedom, since only in a democracy the citizens can have a share in freedom. In essence, he argues that this is what every democracy should make its aim. There are two main aspects of freedom: being ruled and ruling in turn, since everyone is equal according to number, not merit, and to be able to live as one pleases.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rationale">Rationale</span></h3>
<p>Among modern political theorists, there are three contending conceptions of the fundamental rationale for democracy: <i>aggregative democracy,</i> <i><a href="/wiki/Deliberative_democracy" title="Deliberative democracy">deliberative democracy</a>,</i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Radical_democracy" title="Radical democracy">radical democracy</a>.</i></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Aggregative">Aggregative</span></h4>
<p>The theory of <i>aggregative democracy</i> claims that the aim of the democratic processes is to solicit citizens&apos; preferences and aggregate them together to determine what social policies society should adopt. Therefore, proponents of this view hold that democratic participation should primarily focus on <a href="/wiki/Voting" title="Voting">voting</a>, where the policy with the most votes gets implemented.</p>
<p>Different variants of aggregative democracy exist. Under <i>minimalism</i>, democracy is a system of government in which citizens have given teams of political leaders the right to rule in periodic elections. According to this minimalist conception, citizens cannot and should not &quot;rule&quot; because, for example, on most issues, most of the time, they have no clear views or their views are not well-founded. <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Schumpeter" title="Joseph Schumpeter">Joseph Schumpeter</a> articulated this view most famously in his book <i>Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy</i>. Contemporary proponents of minimalism include <a href="/wiki/William_H._Riker" title="William H. Riker">William H. Riker</a>, <a href="/wiki/Adam_Przeworski" title="Adam Przeworski">Adam Przeworski</a>, <a href="/wiki/Richard_Posner" title="Richard Posner">Richard Posner</a>.</p>
<p>According to the theory of <a href="/wiki/Direct_democracy" title="Direct democracy">direct democracy</a>, on the other hand, citizens should vote directly, not through their representatives, on legislative proposals. Proponents of direct democracy offer varied reasons to support this view. Political activity can be valuable in itself, it socialises and educates citizens, and popular participation can check powerful elites. Most importantly, citizens do not really rule themselves unless they directly decide laws and policies.</p>
<p>Governments will tend to produce laws and policies that are close to the views of the median voter &#x2013; with half to their left and the other half to their right. This is not actually a desirable outcome as it represents the action of self-interested and somewhat unaccountable political elites competing for votes. <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Downs" title="Anthony Downs">Anthony Downs</a> suggests that ideological political parties are necessary to act as a mediating broker between individual and governments. Downs laid out this view in his 1957 book <i>An Economic Theory of Democracy</i>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Robert_A._Dahl" title="Robert A. Dahl">Robert A. Dahl</a> argues that the fundamental democratic principle is that, when it comes to binding collective decisions, each person in a political community is entitled to have his/her interests be given equal consideration (not necessarily that all people are equally satisfied by the collective decision). He uses the term <a href="/wiki/Polyarchy" title="Polyarchy">polyarchy</a> to refer to societies in which there exists a certain set of institutions and procedures which are perceived as leading to such democracy. First and foremost among these institutions is the regular occurrence of free and open <a href="/wiki/Elections" class="mw-redirect" title="Elections">elections</a> which are used to select representatives who then manage all or most of the public policy of the society. However, these polyarchic procedures may not create a full democracy if, for example, poverty prevents political participation. Similarly, <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Dworkin" title="Ronald Dworkin">Ronald Dworkin</a> argues that &quot;democracy is a substantive, not a merely procedural, ideal.&quot;</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Deliberative">Deliberative</span></h4>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/Deliberative_democracy" title="Deliberative democracy">Deliberative democracy</a></i> is based on the notion that democracy is government by <a href="/wiki/Deliberation" title="Deliberation">deliberation</a>. Unlike aggregative democracy, deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. <i>Authentic deliberation</i> is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups. If the decision-makers cannot reach <a href="/wiki/Consensus" class="mw-redirect" title="Consensus">consensus</a> after authentically deliberating on a proposal, then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Radical">Radical</span></h4>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/Radical_democracy" title="Radical democracy">Radical democracy</a></i> is based on the idea that there are hierarchical and oppressive power relations that exist in society. Democracy&apos;s role is to make visible and challenge those relations by allowing for difference, dissent and antagonisms in decision making processes.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Inefficiencies">Inefficiencies</span></h4>
<p>Some economists have criticized the efficiency of democracy. They base this on their premise of the irrational voter. Their argument is that voters are highly uninformed about many political issues, especially relating to economics, and have a strong bias about the few issues on which they are fairly knowledgeable. A common example often quoted to substantiate this point is the high economic development achieved by China (a non-democratic country) as compared to India (a democratic country).</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Popular_rule_as_a_fa.C3.A7ade">Popular rule as a fa&#xE7;ade</span></h4>
<p>The 20th-century Italian thinkers <a href="/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto" title="Vilfredo Pareto">Vilfredo Pareto</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gaetano_Mosca" title="Gaetano Mosca">Gaetano Mosca</a> (independently) argued that democracy was illusory, and served only to mask the reality of elite rule. Indeed, they argued that elite oligarchy is the unbendable law of human nature, due largely to the apathy and division of the masses (as opposed to the drive, initiative and unity of the elites), and that democratic institutions would do no more than shift the exercise of power from oppression to manipulation. As <a href="/wiki/Louis_Brandeis" title="Louis Brandeis">Louis Brandeis</a> once professed, &quot;We may have democracy, or we may have <a href="/wiki/Wealth" title="Wealth">wealth</a> concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can&apos;t have both.&quot;</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Mob_rule">Mob rule</span></h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/Plato" title="Plato">Plato</a>&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Republic_(Plato)" class="mw-redirect" title="The Republic (Plato)">The Republic</a></i> presents a critical view of democracy through the narration of <a href="/wiki/Socrates" title="Socrates">Socrates</a>: &quot;Democracy, which is a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequaled alike.&quot; In his work, Plato lists <a href="/wiki/Plato%27s_five_regimes" title="Plato&apos;s five regimes">5 forms of government</a> from best to worst. Assuming that <i>the Republic</i> was intended to be a serious critique of the political thought in Athens, Plato argues that only Kallipolis, an aristocracy led by the unwilling philosopher-kings (the wisest men), is a just form of government.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/James_Madison" title="James Madison">James Madison</a> critiqued direct democracy (which he referred to simply as &quot;democracy&quot;) in <a href="/wiki/Federalist_No._10" title="Federalist No. 10">Federalist No. 10</a>, arguing that representative democracy&#x2014;which he described using the term &quot;republic&quot;&#x2014;is a preferable form of government, saying: &quot;...&#xA0;democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.&quot; Madison offered that republics were superior to democracies because republics safeguarded against <a href="/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority" title="Tyranny of the majority">tyranny of the majority</a>, stating in <a href="/wiki/Federalist_No._10" title="Federalist No. 10">Federalist No. 10</a>: &quot;the same advantage which a republic has over a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by a large over a small republic&quot;.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Political_instability">Political instability</span></h4>
<p>More recently, democracy is criticised for not offering enough political stability. As governments are frequently elected on and off there tends to be frequent changes in the policies of democratic countries both domestically and internationally. Even if a political party maintains power, vociferous, headline grabbing protests and harsh criticism from the mass media are often enough to force sudden, unexpected political change. Frequent policy changes with regard to business and immigration are likely to deter investment and so hinder economic growth. For this reason, many people have put forward the idea that democracy is undesirable for a developing country in which economic growth and the reduction of poverty are top priorities.</p>
<p>This opportunist alliance not only has the handicap of having to cater to too many ideologically opposing factions, but it is usually short lived since any perceived or actual imbalance in the treatment of coalition partners, or changes to leadership in the coalition partners themselves, can very easily result in the coalition partner withdrawing its support from the government.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Fraudulent_elections">Fraudulent elections</span></h4>
<p>In representative democracies, it may not benefit incumbents to conduct fair elections. A study showed that incumbents who rig elections stay in office 2.5 times as long as those who permit fair elections. Democracies in countries with high per capita income have been found to be less prone to violence, but in countries with low incomes the tendency is the reverse. Election misconduct is more likely in countries with low per capita incomes, small populations, rich in natural resources, and a lack of institutional checks and balances. Sub-Saharan countries, as well as Afghanistan, all tend to fall into that category.</p>
<p>Governments that have frequent elections tend to have significantly more stable economic policies than those governments who have infrequent elections. However, this trend does not apply to governments where fraudulent elections are common.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Opposition">Opposition</span></h4>

<p>Democracy in modern times has almost always faced opposition from the previously existing government, and many times it has faced opposition from social elites. The implementation of a democratic government within a non-democratic state is typically brought about by <a href="/wiki/Democratic_revolution" title="Democratic revolution">democratic revolution</a>.</p>
<p>Post-Enlightenment ideologies such as <a href="/wiki/Fascism" title="Fascism">fascism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nazism" title="Nazism">nazism</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Fundamentalism" title="Fundamentalism">neo-fundamentalism</a> oppose democracy on different grounds, generally citing that the concept of democracy as a constant process is flawed and detrimental to a preferable course of development.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Development">Development</span></h2>

<p>Several philosophers and researchers have outlined historical and social factors seen as supporting the evolution of democracy. <i>Cultural factors</i> like <a href="/wiki/Protestantism" title="Protestantism">Protestantism</a> influenced the development of democracy, rule of law, human rights and political liberty (the faithful elected priests, religious freedom and tolerance has been practiced).</p>
<p>Other commentators have mentioned the influence of <i>wealth</i> (e.g. S. M. Lipset, 1959). In a related theory, <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Inglehart" title="Ronald Inglehart">Ronald Inglehart</a> suggests that improved living-standards can convince people that they can take their basic survival for granted, leading to increased emphasis on <a href="/wiki/Self-expression_values" title="Self-expression values">self-expression values</a>, which is highly correlated to democracy.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Carroll_Quigley" title="Carroll Quigley">Carroll Quigley</a> concludes that the characteristics of weapons are the main predictor of democracy: Democracy tends to emerge only when the best weapons available are easy for individuals to buy and use. By the 1800s, guns were the best personal weapons available, and in America, almost everyone could afford to buy a gun, and could learn how to use it fairly easily. Governments couldn&apos;t do any better: it became the age of mass armies of citizen soldiers with guns Similarly, Periclean Greece was an age of the citizen soldier and democracy.</p>
<p>Recent theories stress the relevance of <i>education</i> and of <i><a href="/wiki/Human_capital" title="Human capital">human capital</a></i> - and within them of <i><a href="/wiki/Intelligence" title="Intelligence">cognitive ability</a></i> to increasing tolerance, rationality, political literacy and participation. Two effects of education and cognitive ability are distinguished: a cognitive effect (competence to make rational choices, better information-processing) and an ethical effect (support of democratic values, freedom, human rights etc.), which itself depends on intelligence.</p>
<p>Evidence that is consistent with conventional theories of why democracy emerges and is sustained has been hard to come by. Recent statistical analyses have challenged modernisation theory by demonstrating that there is no reliable evidence for the claim that democracy is more likely to emerge when countries become wealthier, more educated, or less unequal. Neither is there convincing evidence that increased reliance on oil revenues prevents democratisation, despite a vast theoretical literature on &quot;<a href="/wiki/The_Resource_Curse" class="mw-redirect" title="The Resource Curse">the Resource Curse</a>&quot; that asserts that oil revenues sever the link between citizen taxation and government accountability, seen as the key to representative democracy. The lack of evidence for these conventional theories of democratisation have led researchers to search for the &quot;deep&quot; determinants of contemporary political institutions, be they geographical or demographic.</p>
<p>In the 21st century, democracy has become such a popular method of reaching decisions that its application beyond politics to other areas such as entertainment, food and fashion, consumerism, urban planning, education, art, literature, science and theology has been criticised as &quot;the reigning dogma of our time&quot;. The argument suggests that applying a populist or market-driven approach to art and literature (for example), means that innovative creative work goes unpublished or unproduced. In education, the argument is that essential but more difficult studies are not undertaken. Science, as a truth-based discipline, is particularly corrupted by the idea that the correct conclusion can be arrived at by popular vote. However, more recently, theorists have also advanced the concept <a href="/wiki/Epistemic_democracy" title="Epistemic democracy">epistemic democracy</a> to assert that democracy actually does a good job tracking the truth.</p>
<p>Robert Michels asserts that although democracy can never be fully realised, democracy may be developed automatically in the act of striving for democracy: &quot;The peasant in the fable, when on his death-bed, tells his sons that a treasure is buried in the field. After the old man&apos;s death the sons dig everywhere in order to discover the treasure. They do not find it. But their indefatigable labor improves the soil and secures for them a comparative well-being. The treasure in the fable may well symbolise democracy.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Harald Wydra, in his book <i>Communism and The Emergence of Democracy</i> (2007), maintains that the development of democracy should not be viewed as a purely procedural or as a static concept but rather as an ongoing &quot;process of meaning formation&quot;. Drawing on Claude Lefort&apos;s idea of the empty place of power, that &quot;power emanates from the people [...] but is the power of nobody&quot;, he remarks that democracy is reverence to a symbolic mythical authority as in reality, there is no such thing as the people or <i>demos</i>. Democratic political figures are not supreme rulers but rather temporary guardians of an empty place. Any claim to substance such as the collective good, the public interest or the will of the nation is subject to the competitive struggle and times of for gaining the authority of office and government. The essence of the democratic system is an empty place, void of real people which can only be temporarily filled and never be appropriated. The seat of power is there, but remains open to constant change. As such, what &quot;democracy&quot; is or what is &quot;democratic&quot; progresses throughout history as a continual and potentially never ending process of social construction.</p>
<p>In 2010 a study by a German military think-tank analyzed how <a href="/wiki/Peak_oil" title="Peak oil">peak oil</a> might change the global economy. The study raises fears for the survival of democracy itself. It suggests that parts of the population could perceive the upheaval triggered by peak oil as a general systemic crisis. This would create &quot;room for ideological and extremist alternatives to existing forms of government&quot;.</p>
