<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
<p>One year after the events of <i><a href="/wiki/Finding_Nemo" title="Finding Nemo">Finding Nemo</a></i>, Dory, a <a href="/wiki/Paracanthurus" title="Paracanthurus">regal blue tang</a>, experiences dreams of her life prior to meeting Marlin and Nemo, particularly about her parents. Mr. Ray&apos;s lecture triggers Dory&apos;s memories, and she suddenly longs to find her parents, though the only thing she remembers is that they lived at the <a href="/wiki/Morro_Bay,_California" title="Morro Bay, California">Jewel of Morro Bay</a>.</p>
<p>Marlin, initially reluctant, and Nemo decide to accompany Dory in her quest. With the help of Crush, the trio rides the water current to California. On arrival, they are forced to flee from a predatory <a href="/wiki/Giant_squid" title="Giant squid">giant squid</a> that nearly devours Nemo. Afterwards, Marlin snaps at Dory for endangering Nemo. Although hurt, Dory seeks help and travels to the surface, where she is rescued by volunteers from the Marine Life Institute after being caught in <a href="/wiki/Six_pack_rings" title="Six pack rings">six pack rings</a>.</p>
<p>Dory is sent to the Quarantine section and tagged. There, she meets an ill-tempered, seven-legged <a href="/wiki/Octopus" title="Octopus">octopus</a> named Hank. He deciphers Dory&apos;s tag, which means she will be sent to a permanent aquarium in <a href="/wiki/Cleveland" title="Cleveland">Cleveland</a>, instead of being released. Due to a past trauma, Hank wants to live in an enclosed area, and he agrees to help Dory find her parents in exchange for her tag. Discovering her birthplace in the aquarium&apos;s Open Ocean exhibit, she enlists the help of her childhood friend Destiny, a nearsighted <a href="/wiki/Whale_shark" title="Whale shark">whale shark</a>, and Bailey, a <a href="/wiki/Beluga_whale" title="Beluga whale">beluga whale</a> who believes he is unable to <a href="/wiki/Animal_echolocation" title="Animal echolocation">echolocate</a>. Dory learns that the blue tangs are receiving their own exhibit in Cleveland and have been sent to Quarantine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Marlin and Nemo attempt to rescue Dory. After an encounter with a pair of <a href="/wiki/Sea_lions" class="mw-redirect" title="Sea lions">sea lions</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Common_loon" title="Common loon">common loon</a> named Becky, they manage to get into the Institute. By traveling through various exhibits and places, they reunite with Dory in the institute&apos;s pipe system. The trio travels back to Quarantine with the help of Destiny and Bailey.</p>
<p>The group locates a tank of blue tangs, but they tell her that Dory&apos;s parents escaped to search for Dory and haven&apos;t been back since. Dory is shocked, believing her parents to be dead. Hank manages to retrieve Dory from the tank while Marlin, Nemo, and the blue tangs are loaded in a truck bound for Cleveland. An anxious Hank, who is apprehended by one of the Institute&apos;s employees, accidentally drops Dory into the drain that takes her to the ocean. Dory wanders around inconsolably before she comes across a trail of shells that leads her to her parents, who tell her they had thought she was sucked into the ocean. Hoping to reunite with her, they had gone into the drain and spent years forming trails of shells for her to follow.</p>
<p>Dory&apos;s family, with Destiny, Bailey, a group of <a href="/wiki/Sea_otter" title="Sea otter">sea otters</a> and Becky, help Dory in rescuing Marlin and Nemo. Dory manages to persuade Hank to live in the ocean. The group finally manages to reach the ocean by hijacking the truck and crashing it into the water, freeing the other fish in the process. Dory returns with Marlin and Nemo to the reef, taking her parents, Hank, Destiny, and Bailey along.</p>
<p>In a <a href="/wiki/Post-credits_scene" title="Post-credits scene">post-credits scene</a>, the Tank Gang, still trapped in their now algae-covered plastic bags, reach California after a year of swimming across the Pacific. They are then captured by volunteers.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span></h2>
<p>Prior to work on <i>Finding Dory</i>, Disney had planned to make a <i>Finding Nemo</i> sequel without Pixar&apos;s involvement, through <a href="/wiki/Circle_7_Animation" title="Circle 7 Animation">Circle 7 Animation</a>, a studio Disney announced in 2005 with the intention to make sequels to Pixar properties. However, in 2006, Circle 7 was shut down by Disney without ever having produced a film.</p>
<p>In July 2012, it was reported that <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Stanton" title="Andrew Stanton">Andrew Stanton</a> was developing a sequel to <i>Finding Nemo</i>, with Victoria Strouse writing the script and a release date scheduled for 2016. However, the same day the news of a potential sequel broke, Stanton posted a message on his personal Twitter calling into question the accuracy of these reports. The message said, &quot;Didn&apos;t you all learn from <i><a href="/wiki/Chicken_Little_(2005_film)" title="Chicken Little (2005 film)">Chicken Little</a></i>? Everyone calm down. Don&apos;t believe everything you read. Nothing to see here now. #skyisnotfalling&quot;. According to a report by <i><a href="/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter" title="The Hollywood Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a></i> published in August 2012, <a href="/wiki/Ellen_DeGeneres" title="Ellen DeGeneres">Ellen DeGeneres</a> was in negotiations to reprise her role of Dory. In September 2012, it was confirmed by Stanton, saying: &quot;What was immediately on the list was writing a second <i><a href="/wiki/John_Carter_(film)" title="John Carter (film)">Carter</a></i> movie. When that went away, everything slid up. I know I&apos;ll be accused by more sarcastic people that it&apos;s a reaction to <i>Carter</i> not doing well, but only in its timing, but not in its conceit&quot;. In February 2013, it was confirmed by the press that <a href="/wiki/Albert_Brooks" title="Albert Brooks">Albert Brooks</a> would reprise the role of Marlin in the sequel.</p>
<p>In April 2013, Disney announced the sequel, <i>Finding Dory</i>, for November 25, 2015, confirming that Ellen DeGeneres and Albert Brooks would be reprising their roles as Dory and Marlin, respectively. Following a long campaign for a sequel on <i><a href="/wiki/The_Ellen_DeGeneres_Show" title="The Ellen DeGeneres Show">The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a></i>, DeGeneres stated:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>I have waited for this day for a long, long, long, long, long, long time. I&apos;m not mad it took this long. I know the people at Pixar were busy creating <i>Toy Story 16</i>. But the time they took was worth it. The script is fantastic. And it has everything I loved about the first one: It&apos;s got a lot of heart, it&apos;s really funny, and the best part is&#x2014;it&apos;s got a lot more Dory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a July 2013 interview with <i><a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a></i>, Stanton spoke of the sequel&apos;s origin: &quot;There was polite inquiry from Disney [about a <i>Finding Nemo</i> sequel]. I was always &apos;No sequels, no sequels.&apos; But I had to get on board from a <a href="/wiki/Vice_president" title="Vice president">VP</a> standpoint. [Sequels] are part of the necessity of our staying afloat, but we don&apos;t want to have to go there for those reasons. We want to go there creatively, so we said [to Disney], &apos;Can you give us the timeline about when we release them? Because we&apos;d like to release something we actually want to make, and we might not come up with it the year you want it&apos;&quot;.</p>
<p>In a 2016 interview Stanton stated how the film&apos;s story came to be; &quot;I don&apos;t watch my films that often after they&apos;re done because I have to watch them so many times before they come out. So about 2010 when we were getting <i>Finding Nemo</i> ready for the 10-year re-release in 3D, it was interesting to watch again after all that time. Something kind of got lodged in the back of my brain and started to sort of stew. I started to think about how easily Dory could get lost and not find Marlin and Nemo again. She basically was in the same state that she was when Marlin found her. I didn&apos;t know where she was from. I knew that she had spent most of her youth wandering the ocean alone, and I wanted to know that she could find her new family, if she ever got lost again. It&apos;s almost like the parental side of me was worried&quot;. Stanton additionally stated: &quot;I knew if I ever said <i>Finding Dory</i> or mentioned a sequel to <i>Finding Nemo</i> out loud, I&#x2019;d be done, [T]here would be no way I&apos;d be able to put that horse back in the barn. So I kept it very quiet until I knew I had a story that I thought would hold, and that was in early 2012. So I pitched it to <a href="/wiki/John_Lasseter" title="John Lasseter">John Lasseter</a> and he was all into it. Then I got a writer, and once we had a treatment that we kind of liked, I felt comfortable calling Ellen&quot;.</p>
<p>The writer that Stanton selected to write the screenplay was Victoria Strouse. She later said, &quot;It was always collaborative with Andrew, but really the screenwriting was me. Of course, Andrew would do passes, and he and I would brainstorm a lot together and then we would bring it to the group of story artists. People would weigh in and share ideas.&quot; She pointed to Dory&apos;s forgetfulness as a challenge when writing the script, adding, &quot;You don&#x2019;t realize until you sit down to write a character who can&#x2019;t remember things how integral memory is to absolutely everything we do, and that&#x2019;s what creates a narrative that people can follow. When a main character can&#x2019;t self-reflect and can&#x2019;t tell a story, that character is very difficult to design because she can&#x2019;t really lead. To get her to be able to lead and to get an audience to be able to trust her was the hardest thing to do.&quot;</p>
<p>The film&apos;s ending was revised after Pixar executives viewed <i><a href="/wiki/Blackfish_(film)" title="Blackfish (film)">Blackfish</a></i>, a 2013 documentary film which focuses on the dangers of keeping <a href="/wiki/Killer_whale" title="Killer whale">orca whales</a> in captivity. Initially, some of the characters were to end up in a <a href="/wiki/SeaWorld" title="SeaWorld">SeaWorld</a>-like marine park, but the revision gave them an option to leave. On September 18, 2013, it was announced that the film would be pushed back to a June 17, 2016, release. Pixar&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Good_Dinosaur" title="The Good Dinosaur">The Good Dinosaur</a></i> was moved to the November 25, 2015, slot to allow more time for production of the film.</p>
<p>In June 2014, it was revealed through Stanton&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> feed that the film would be co-directed by <a href="/wiki/Angus_MacLane" title="Angus MacLane">Angus MacLane</a>.</p>
<p>In August 2015, at Disney&apos;s <a href="/wiki/D23_Expo" class="mw-redirect" title="D23 Expo">D23 Expo</a>, it was announced that Hayden Rolence would voice Nemo, replacing <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Gould" title="Alexander Gould">Alexander Gould</a> from the first film, whose voice has deepened since reaching adulthood (Gould voiced a minor character in the sequel instead). In addition to Rolence, <a href="/wiki/Ed_O%27Neill" title="Ed O&apos;Neill">Ed O&apos;Neill</a> was revealed to be the voice of Hank.</p>
