<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ajax">Ajax</span></h3>
<p>Rijkaard was born in <a href="/wiki/Amsterdam" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>. His mother, Neel, is <a href="/wiki/Dutch_people" title="Dutch people">Dutch</a> and his father, <a href="/wiki/Herman_Rijkaard" title="Herman Rijkaard">Herman</a>, was a former <a href="/wiki/Suriname" title="Suriname">Surinamese</a> footballer. Rijkaard was just 17 when Ajax coach <a href="/wiki/Leo_Beenhakker" title="Leo Beenhakker">Leo Beenhakker</a> gave him his senior squad debut 23 August 1980. He made an immediate impact, scoring the third goal in a 4&#x2013;2 away victory over <a href="/wiki/Go_Ahead_Eagles" title="Go Ahead Eagles">Go Ahead Eagles</a>, the first league match in the <a href="/wiki/1980%E2%80%9381_Eredivisie" title="1980&#x2013;81 Eredivisie">1980&#x2013;81 season</a>. He would play another 23 games for Ajax in his first season, netting a total of 4 goals. In <a href="/wiki/1981%E2%80%9382_Eredivisie" title="1981&#x2013;82 Eredivisie">1981&#x2013;82</a> he won his first league championship with Ajax, and went on to successfully defend that title in the following <a href="/wiki/1982%E2%80%9383_Eredivisie" title="1982&#x2013;83 Eredivisie">season</a>. Rijkaard stayed at Ajax for seven and a half seasons, as a central defender (1981&#x2013;82, 1982&#x2013;83, 1984&#x2013;85), a right midfielder and a central midfielder (1985&#x2013;86). During this period he won the Dutch league championship three times (1981&#x2013;82, 1982&#x2013;83, <a href="/wiki/1984%E2%80%9385_Eredivisie" title="1984&#x2013;85 Eredivisie">1984&#x2013;85</a>) and the Dutch Cup three times (<a href="/wiki/KNVB_Cup_1982%E2%80%9383" class="mw-redirect" title="KNVB Cup 1982&#x2013;83">1982&#x2013;83</a>, <a href="/wiki/KNVB_Cup_1985%E2%80%9386" class="mw-redirect" title="KNVB Cup 1985&#x2013;86">1985&#x2013;86</a>, <a href="/wiki/KNVB_Cup_1986%E2%80%9387" class="mw-redirect" title="KNVB Cup 1986&#x2013;87">1986&#x2013;87</a>). In the 1986&#x2013;87 season he won the <a href="/wiki/Cup_Winners%27_Cup" class="mw-redirect" title="Cup Winners&apos; Cup">Cup Winners&apos; Cup</a> with Ajax (Final: Ajax 1&#x2013;0 Lokomotive Leipzig). In September 1987, what would have been Rijkaard&apos;s third season (<a href="/wiki/1987%E2%80%9388_Eredivisie" title="1987&#x2013;88 Eredivisie">1987&#x2013;88</a>) under Dutch football legend <a href="/wiki/Johan_Cruyff" title="Johan Cruyff">Johan Cruyff</a> as head coach, Rijkaard stormed off the training field and vowed never to play under him again. He was signed by the Portuguese club <a href="/wiki/Sporting_Clube_de_Portugal" title="Sporting Clube de Portugal">Sporting CP</a>, but he signed too late to be eligible to play in any competition. He was immediately loaned out to Spanish team <a href="/wiki/Real_Zaragoza" title="Real Zaragoza">Real Zaragoza</a>, but upon completing his first season at Zaragoza, was signed by Italian side <a href="/wiki/A.C._Milan" title="A.C. Milan">Milan</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Milan">Milan</span></h3>
<p>Rijkaard played for five seasons at Milan. It was coach <a href="/wiki/Arrigo_Sacchi" title="Arrigo Sacchi">Arrigo Sacchi</a> who saw Rijkaard as playing a pivotal role at Milan and transformed the central defender into a world class holding midfielder, where the Dutchman&apos;s aggressive and firm style would go on to influence the likes of <a href="/wiki/Patrick_Vieira" title="Patrick Vieira">Patrick Vieira</a> to replicate in future years. Playing alongside fellow country-men <a href="/wiki/Marco_van_Basten" title="Marco van Basten">Marco van Basten</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ruud_Gullit" title="Ruud Gullit">Ruud Gullit</a>, Rijkaard won the <a href="/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League" title="UEFA Champions League">European Cup</a> twice (in <a href="/wiki/European_Cup_1988-89#Final" class="mw-redirect" title="European Cup 1988-89">1989</a> against <a href="/wiki/FC_Steaua_Bucure%C8%99ti" title="FC Steaua Bucure&#x219;ti">Steaua Bucure&#x219;ti</a> and <a href="/wiki/European_Cup_1989-90#Final" class="mw-redirect" title="European Cup 1989-90">1990</a>, against <a href="/wiki/S.L._Benfica" title="S.L.

In the <a href="/wiki/1990_European_Cup_Final" title="1990 European Cup Final">1990 European Cup Final</a> he scored the only goal to win the cup for Milan.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Return_to_Ajax">Return to Ajax</span></h3>
<p>After five seasons in Italy, Rijkaard returned to Ajax in 1993. With <a href="/wiki/Louis_van_Gaal" title="Louis van Gaal">Louis van Gaal</a> at the helm, Rijkaard and <a href="/wiki/Danny_Blind" title="Danny Blind">Danny Blind</a> formed the experienced defensive core of the Ajax team that won the first two of three consecutive Dutch Championships. Ajax were the unbeaten champions of the Netherlands in the <a href="/wiki/1994%E2%80%9395_Eredivisie" title="1994&#x2013;95 Eredivisie">1994&#x2013;95 season</a>, and carried that success into Europe. In his final game, Rijkaard won the Champions League, with a 1&#x2013;0 victory over Milan in the <a href="/wiki/1995_UEFA_Champions_League_Final" title="1995 UEFA Champions League Final">1995 final</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Ernst_Happel_Stadion" class="mw-redirect" title="Ernst Happel Stadion">Ernst Happel Stadion</a> in Vienna.

<p>Rijkaard was the cause of an incident with <a href="/wiki/Rudi_V%C3%B6ller" title="Rudi V&#xF6;ller">Rudi V&#xF6;ller</a> when West Germany played the Netherlands in the 1990 World Cup. Rijkaard was booked for a tackle on V&#xF6;ller and, as Rijkaard took up position for the free kick, he spat in V&#xF6;ller&apos;s hair. V&#xF6;ller complained to the referee and was booked as well. From the resulting free kick, V&#xF6;ller then handled the ball and then went to the ground (according to his own account) to avoid a collision with Dutch keeper <a href="/wiki/Hans_van_Breukelen" title="Hans van Breukelen">Hans van Breukelen</a>, while others, notably Rijkaard and van Breukelen, saw Voller&apos;s handball and his resulting action as a dive in hopes for a penalty. Van Breukelen was angry at this but Rijkaard, already annoyed by V&#xF6;ller&apos;s previous antics, again confronted the West German by twisting his ear and stamping on his foot. The Argentine referee <a href="/wiki/Juan_Carlos_Loustau" title="Juan Carlos Loustau">Juan Carlos Loustau</a> was tired of both V&#xF6;ller and Rijkaard&apos;s consistently hostile antics towards each other in such a short period of time, and fearing a fight between the two, sent off both Rijkaard and V&#xF6;ller. As he jogged back to the entrance tunnel, Rijkaard again spat in V&#xF6;ller&apos;s hair as they left the pitch. The German press nicknamed him &quot;<a href="/wiki/Llama" title="Llama">Llama</a>&quot; for his spitting. Rijkaard would later apologise for his behaviour to V&#xF6;ller, who accepted. At Euro 1992, Rijkaard scored a late equalizer for the Netherlands in a 2&#x2013;2 draw with Denmark at the semi final stage but the Dutch went out on penalties. He made his final appearance for the Netherlands in the 3&#x2013;2 defeat against eventual winners <a href="/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team" title="Brazil national football team">Brazil</a> in the quarter-finals of the <a href="/wiki/1994_FIFA_World_Cup" title="1994 FIFA World Cup">1994 FIFA World Cup</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Style_of_play">Style of play</span></h2>
<p>Regarded as one of the greatest players in his position, Rijkaard was a quick, strong, complete, and tenacious <a href="/wiki/Defensive_midfielder" class="mw-redirect" title="Defensive midfielder">defensive midfielder</a>, who was praised by pundits throughout his career for his physical and athletic attributes, his work rate, positioning, his acute tactical intelligence and decision making, as well as his outstanding consistency and ability to read the game; due to his versatility, he was also capable of playing in a <a href="/wiki/Defender_(association_football)" title="Defender (association football)">defensive</a> role. Rijkaard was a strong tackler, with good technique and vision, which made him adept at starting attacking plays once he won back possession; he also possessed a powerful shot.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Managerial_career">Managerial career</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_years">Early years</span></h3>
<p>Rijkaard&apos;s coaching career began when he was appointed manager of the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands_national_football_team" title="Netherlands national football team">Netherlands national team</a> in 1998. He had previously served as an assistant coach, along with <a href="/wiki/Johan_Neeskens" title="Johan Neeskens">Johan Neeskens</a> and Ronald Koeman under the managerial tenure of <a href="/wiki/Guus_Hiddink" title="Guus Hiddink">Guus Hiddink</a>. At the time, he was not taken seriously as a manager because of his inexperience, but he was able to guide his national side to the semi-finals of <a href="/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2000" title="UEFA Euro 2000">UEFA Euro 2000</a>. During the group phase, the Dutch team won slowly but surely and managed to get three victories: 1&#x2013;0 against the <a href="/wiki/Czech_Republic_national_football_team" title="Czech Republic national football team">Czech Republic</a>, 3&#x2013;0 against <a href="/wiki/Denmark_national_football_team" title="Denmark national football team">Denmark</a> and 3&#x2013;2 against <a href="/wiki/France_national_football_team" title="France national football team">France</a>. In the quarter-final, his side produced the biggest win of the competition, a 6&#x2013;1 result against <a href="/wiki/Yugoslavia_national_football_team" title="Yugoslavia national football team">Yugoslavia</a>. The Netherlands played some of the best football of the tournament, but lost their semi-final match to <a href="/wiki/Italy_national_football_team" title="Italy national football team">Italy</a> on penalties; Rijkaard resigned immediately.</p>
<p>During the 2001&#x2013;02 season, he became manager of <a href="/wiki/Sparta_Rotterdam" title="Sparta Rotterdam">Sparta Rotterdam</a> in the Dutch <a href="/wiki/Eredivisie" title="Eredivisie">Eredivisie</a>, the oldest professional team in the country. Rijkaard enjoyed the down-to-earth atmosphere, although the club was not financially strong. Under his leadership, the club was <a href="/wiki/Relegated" class="mw-redirect" title="Relegated">relegated</a> to the second division for the first time in its history, and he was fired as a consequence.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Barcelona">Barcelona</span></h3>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="First_years">First years</span></h4>
<p>Rijkaard was not out of a coaching role for long, and less than a year after leaving Sparta, he was appointed manager of <a href="/wiki/FC_Barcelona" title="FC Barcelona">Barcelona</a> for the <a href="/wiki/2003%E2%80%9304_La_Liga" title="2003&#x2013;04 La Liga">2003&#x2013;04 season</a>. The season would prove to be a watershed for the club, but not without initial instability. Rijkaard arrived at the club as it entered a new phase, having elected a new president in <a href="/wiki/Joan_Laporta" title="Joan Laporta">Joan Laporta</a> and a new managerial board, but with fans unhappy that Laporta had let English midfielder <a href="/wiki/David_Beckham" title="David Beckham">David Beckham</a> snub the chance to join the club. For Rijkaard, the team he inherited, with the exception of new superstar signing <a href="/wiki/Ronaldinho" title="Ronaldinho">Ronaldinho</a> (who was the club&apos;s second choice after Beckham), also consisted of many underachieving players from the old guard and era that failed to meet the club and its fans&apos; demands to match archrival <a href="/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F." title="Real Madrid C.F.">Real Madrid</a>&apos;s success in the early 2000s, having not won a trophy since 1999.</p>
<p>Rijkaard had a disappointing start at Barcelona that saw some sections of the club&apos;s fans call for his resignation, and he drew flak from the media when the team lost to Real Madrid in December 2003. Rijkaard&apos;s resilience won through and from 2004 onwards, he achieved a massive turnaround, as the team went from strength to strength. Barcelona finished runners-up in <a href="/wiki/La_Liga" title="La Liga">La Liga</a> in <a href="/wiki/2003%E2%80%9304_La_Liga" title="2003&#x2013;04 La Liga">2003&#x2013;04</a>, having been close to the relegation zone at one point in the earlier stages of the season. Rijkaard then took Barcelona to the next level as he phased out the old guard and rebuilt a new-look side around Ronaldinho, with new players like <a href="/wiki/Deco" title="Deco">Deco</a>, <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Eto%27o" title="Samuel Eto&apos;o">Samuel Eto&apos;o</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rafael_M%C3%A1rquez" title="Rafael M&#xE1;rquez">Rafael M&#xE1;rquez</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ludovic_Giuly" title="Ludovic Giuly">Ludovic Giuly</a>, along with the latest promotion of some young players from the previous era trained in the club&apos;s youth teams, including <a href="/wiki/V%C3%ADctor_Vald%C3%A9s" title="V&#xED;ctor Vald&#xE9;s">V&#xED;ctor Vald&#xE9;s</a> and <a href="/wiki/Andr%C3%A9s_Iniesta" title="Andr&#xE9;s Iniesta">Andr&#xE9;s Iniesta</a>. He eventually succeeded in turning around the fortunes of the club, with the strong support of Laporta, and within the next couple of years finally managed to win La Liga both in <a href="/wiki/2004%E2%80%9305_La_Liga" title="2004&#x2013;05 La Liga">2004&#x2013;05</a> and in <a href="/wiki/2005%E2%80%9306_La_Liga" title="2005&#x2013;06 La Liga">2005&#x2013;06</a>.</p>

On 8 March 2006, he was also honoured by <a href="/wiki/UEFA" title="UEFA">UEFA</a> for his contributions to the European Cup competition throughout his career as player and manager.</p>
<p>Rijkaard also achieved success on the European stage, winning the <a href="/wiki/2005%E2%80%9306_UEFA_Champions_League" title="2005&#x2013;06 UEFA Champions League">2005&#x2013;06 Champions League</a> with a <a href="/wiki/2006_UEFA_Champions_League_Final" title="2006 UEFA Champions League Final">2&#x2013;1</a> win against <a href="/wiki/Arsenal_F.C." title="Arsenal F.C.">Arsenal</a> in the final. Barcelona had been losing 1&#x2013;0 for most of the match before his late tactical substitutions proved the decisive factor, as the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Henrik_Larsson" title="Henrik Larsson">Henrik Larsson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Juliano_Belletti" title="Juliano Belletti">Juliano Belletti</a> contributed directly to Barcelona&apos;s two goals.

He replied, &quot;I have no intention of leaving. It would be different if the players were saying it is time for me to go but that is not the case.&quot; On 1 May 2008, it was reported that Rijkaard allegedly confided to a colleague that he would be stepping down as Barcelona manager at the end of the season, but 24 hours later, he stated in a press conference that he had no intention of leaving the club.</p>

Laporta made the announcement after a board meeting, and Rijkaard was succeeded by Pep Guardiola. Laporta made it clear that Rijkaard&apos;s achievements &quot;made history&quot; and praised him for his time at the club.</p>

Rijkaard coaching Galatasaray in 2009.</div>

<p>As a coach, Rijkaard&apos;s essential philosophy is to guide his team towards playing attack-minded football as a cohesive unit. In doing this, he believes a team can achieve the dual objectives of winning games and ensuring the audience&apos;s enjoyment of the spectacle. This follows in the best coaching traditions of Rijkaard&apos;s countrymen and forebears <a href="/wiki/Rinus_Michels" title="Rinus Michels">Rinus Michels</a> and Johan Cruyff. In this light, it is notable that Michels coached both Cruyff and Rijkaard during their respective participations with the Dutch national team, and that Cruyff himself went on to coach Rijkaard. Nonetheless, Rijkaard believes in working within a contemporary football context and is not out to imitate the styles and tactics of past masters. In his own words:</p>

<p>Rijkaard has evidently learned to curb the quick temper of his playing days and is often a portrait of calm and stability in training and along the touchline. He rarely courts controversy in the media and is more apt now to promote a positive environment and let his team&apos;s play speak for itself when faced with intense rivalry or criticism. The tactics used during his tenure as manager of Barcelona best exemplify Rijkaard&apos;s commitment to playing stylish attacking football. During the team&apos;s 2004&#x2013;05 and 2005&#x2013;06 campaigns, the coach frequently fielded a 4&#x2013;3&#x2013;3 formation, a system which encouraged the creativity of the players in the front third of the field and created optimal interplay between the midfielders and forwards during attacks. Within this system the four defenders also tended to play in a relatively high position on the pitch to support the midfield which frequently advanced to participate in the attack. The team generally focuses on maintaining possession in the opponents&apos; half of the field, applying pressure in order to force the opposition to make errors in defense and offensive counter-attacking.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Personal_life">Personal life</span></h2>
<p>Rijkaard comes from a football playing family.
