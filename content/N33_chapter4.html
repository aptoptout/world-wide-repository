<p>Following the <a href="/wiki/Cuban_Revolution" title="Cuban Revolution">Cuban Revolution</a>, Guevara performed a number of key roles in the new government.

<p>Ernesto Guevara was born to Ernesto Guevara Lynch and his wife, Celia de la Serna y Llosa, on June 14, 1928 in <a href="/wiki/Rosario" class="mw-redirect" title="Rosario">Rosario</a>, <a href="/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, the eldest of five children in an aristocratic <a href="/wiki/Argentine_people" class="mw-redirect" title="Argentine people">Argentine</a> family of <a href="/wiki/Spanish_immigration_to_Argentina" class="mw-redirect" title="Spanish immigration to Argentina">Spanish</a>, <a href="/wiki/Basque_Argentine" title="Basque Argentine">Basque</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Irish_Argentine" title="Irish Argentine">Irish</a> descent. In accordance with the flexibility allowed in <a href="/wiki/Spanish_language" title="Spanish language">Spanish naming customs</a>, his legal name (Ernesto Guevara) will sometimes appear with &quot;de la Serna&quot; and/or &quot;Lynch&quot; accompanying it. Referring to Che&apos;s &quot;restless&quot; nature, his father declared &quot;the first thing to note is that in my son&apos;s veins flowed the blood of the <a href="/wiki/Irish_Rebellion_of_1798" title="Irish Rebellion of 1798">Irish rebels</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>Very early on in life, Ernestito (as he was then called) developed an &quot;affinity for the poor&quot;. Growing up in a family with <a href="/wiki/Left-wing_politics" title="Left-wing politics">leftist</a> leanings, Guevara was introduced to a wide spectrum of political perspectives even as a boy. His father, a staunch supporter of <a href="/wiki/Second_Spanish_Republic" title="Second Spanish Republic">Republicans</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>, often hosted many veterans from the conflict in the Guevara home.</p>
<p>Despite suffering crippling bouts of acute <a href="/wiki/Asthma" title="Asthma">asthma</a> that were to afflict him throughout his life, he excelled as an athlete, enjoying swimming, football, golf, and shooting; while also becoming an &quot;untiring&quot; cyclist. He was an avid <a href="/wiki/Rugby_union" title="Rugby union">rugby union</a> player, and played at <a href="/wiki/Fly-half" class="mw-redirect" title="Fly-half">fly-half</a> for <a href="/wiki/Club_Universitario_de_Buenos_Aires" title="Club Universitario de Buenos Aires">Club Universitario de Buenos Aires</a>. His rugby playing earned him the nickname &quot;Fuser&quot;&#x2014;a contraction of <i>El Furibundo</i> (raging) and his mother&apos;s surname, de la Serna&#x2014;for his aggressive style of play.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Guevara learned <a href="/wiki/Chess" title="Chess">chess</a> from his father and began participating in local tournaments by age 12. During adolescence and throughout his life, he was passionate about poetry, especially that of <a href="/wiki/Pablo_Neruda" title="Pablo Neruda">Pablo Neruda</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_Keats" title="John Keats">John Keats</a>, <a href="/wiki/Antonio_Machado" title="Antonio Machado">Antonio Machado</a>, <a href="/wiki/Federico_Garc%C3%ADa_Lorca" title="Federico Garc&#xED;a Lorca">Federico Garc&#xED;a Lorca</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gabriela_Mistral" title="Gabriela Mistral">Gabriela Mistral</a>, <a href="/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Vallejo" title="C&#xE9;sar Vallejo">C&#xE9;sar Vallejo</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Walt_Whitman" title="Walt Whitman">Walt Whitman</a>.

Additionally, he enjoyed the works of <a href="/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru" title="Jawaharlal Nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a>, <a href="/wiki/Franz_Kafka" title="Franz Kafka">Franz Kafka</a>, <a href="/wiki/Albert_Camus" title="Albert Camus">Albert Camus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin" title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre" title="Jean-Paul Sartre">Jean-Paul Sartre</a>; as well as <a href="/wiki/Anatole_France" title="Anatole France">Anatole France</a>, <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Engels" title="Friedrich Engels">Friedrich Engels</a>, <a href="/wiki/H._G._Wells" title="H. G. Wells">H. G. Wells</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Robert_Frost" title="Robert Frost">Robert Frost</a>.</p>
<p>As he grew older, he developed an interest in the Latin American writers <a href="/wiki/Horacio_Quiroga" title="Horacio Quiroga">Horacio Quiroga</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ciro_Alegr%C3%ADa" title="Ciro Alegr&#xED;a">Ciro Alegr&#xED;a</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jorge_Icaza" class="mw-redirect" title="Jorge Icaza">Jorge Icaza</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rub%C3%A9n_Dar%C3%ADo" title="Rub&#xE9;n Dar&#xED;o">Rub&#xE9;n Dar&#xED;o</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Miguel_Asturias" class="mw-redirect" title="Miguel Asturias">Miguel Asturias</a>. Many of these authors&apos; ideas he cataloged in his own handwritten notebooks of concepts, definitions, and philosophies of influential intellectuals. These included composing analytical sketches of <a href="/wiki/Gautama_Buddha" title="Gautama Buddha">Buddha</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, along with examining <a href="/wiki/Bertrand_Russell" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> on love and patriotism, <a href="/wiki/Jack_London" title="Jack London">Jack London</a> on society, and <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Nietzsche</a> on the idea of death. <a href="/wiki/Sigmund_Freud" title="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>&apos;s ideas fascinated him as he quoted him on a variety of topics from <a href="/wiki/Dream_interpretation" title="Dream interpretation">dreams</a> and <a href="/wiki/Libido" title="Libido">libido</a> to <a href="/wiki/Narcissism" title="Narcissism">narcissism</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Oedipus_complex" title="Oedipus complex">Oedipus complex</a>.

<p>Years later, a February 13, 1958, declassified CIA &apos;biographical and personality report&apos; would make note of Guevara&apos;s wide range of academic interests and intellect, describing him as &quot;quite well read&quot; while adding that &quot;Che is fairly intellectual for a Latino.&quot;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Motorcycle_journey">Motorcycle journey</span></h3>

<p>In 1948, Guevara entered the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Buenos_Aires" title="University of Buenos Aires">University of Buenos Aires</a> to study medicine. His &quot;hunger to explore the world&quot; led him to intersperse his collegiate pursuits with two long introspective journeys that would fundamentally change the way he viewed himself and the contemporary economic conditions in Latin America. The first expedition in 1950 was a 4,500-kilometer (2,800&#xA0;mi) solo trip through the rural provinces of <a href="/wiki/Argentine_Northwest" title="Argentine Northwest">northern Argentina</a> on a bicycle on which he installed a small engine. This was followed in 1951 by a nine-month, 8,000-kilometer (5,000&#xA0;mi) continental motorcycle trek through most of South America. For the latter, he took a year off from his studies to embark with his friend <a href="/wiki/Alberto_Granado" title="Alberto Granado">Alberto Granado</a>, with the final goal of spending a few weeks volunteering at the San Pablo <a href="/wiki/Leper_colony" title="Leper colony">leper colony</a> in <a href="/wiki/Peru" title="Peru">Peru</a>, on the banks of the <a href="/wiki/Amazon_River" title="Amazon River">Amazon River</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Chile" title="Chile">Chile</a>, Guevara found himself enraged by the working conditions of the miners in <a href="/wiki/Anaconda_Copper" title="Anaconda Copper">Anaconda</a>&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Chuquicamata" title="Chuquicamata">Chuquicamata</a> copper mine and moved by his overnight encounter in the <a href="/wiki/Atacama_Desert" title="Atacama Desert">Atacama Desert</a> with a persecuted <a href="/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Chile" title="Communist Party of Chile">communist</a> couple who did not even own a blanket, describing them as &quot;the shivering flesh-and-blood victims of capitalist exploitation&quot;. Additionally, on the way to <a href="/wiki/Machu_Picchu" title="Machu Picchu">Machu Picchu</a> high in the <a href="/wiki/Andes" title="Andes">Andes</a>, he was struck by the crushing poverty of the remote rural areas, where peasant farmers worked small plots of land owned by wealthy landlords. Later on his journey, Guevara was especially impressed by the camaraderie among those living in a leper colony, stating &quot;The highest forms of human solidarity and loyalty arise among such lonely and desperate people.&quot; Guevara used notes taken during this trip to write an account, titled <i><a href="/wiki/The_Motorcycle_Diaries_(book)" title="The Motorcycle Diaries (book)">The Motorcycle Diaries</a></i>, which later became a <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> best-seller, and was adapted into a 2004 <a href="/wiki/The_Motorcycle_Diaries_(film)#Awards" title="The Motorcycle Diaries (film)">award-winning</a> <a href="/wiki/The_Motorcycle_Diaries_(film)" title="The Motorcycle Diaries (film)">film of the same name</a>.</p>

By the end of the trip, he came to view Latin America not as collection of separate nations, but as a single entity requiring a continent-wide liberation strategy. His conception of a borderless, united <a href="/wiki/Hispanic_America" title="Hispanic America">Hispanic America</a> sharing a common Latino heritage was a theme that recurred prominently during his later revolutionary activities. Upon returning to Argentina, he completed his studies and received his medical degree in June 1953, making him officially &quot;Dr. Ernesto Guevara&quot;.</p>

<p>Guevara later remarked that through his travels in Latin America, he came in &quot;close contact with poverty, <a href="/wiki/Hunger" title="Hunger">hunger</a> and disease&quot; along with the &quot;inability to treat a child because of lack of money&quot; and &quot;stupefaction provoked by the continual hunger and punishment&quot; that leads a father to &quot;accept the loss of a son as an unimportant accident&quot;. It was these experiences which Guevara cites as convincing him that in order to &quot;help these people&quot;, he needed to leave the realm of medicine, and consider the political arena of armed struggle.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>On July 7, 1953, Guevara set out again, this time to Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Panama, <a href="/wiki/Costa_Rica" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rica</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nicaragua" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>, <a href="/wiki/Honduras" title="Honduras">Honduras</a> and <a href="/wiki/El_Salvador" title="El Salvador">El Salvador</a>. On December 10, 1953, before leaving for Guatemala, Guevara sent an update to his Aunt Beatriz from <a href="/wiki/San_Jos%C3%A9,_Costa_Rica" title="San Jos&#xE9;, Costa Rica">San Jos&#xE9;, Costa Rica</a>. In the letter Guevara speaks of traversing through the dominion of the <a href="/wiki/United_Fruit_Company" title="United Fruit Company">United Fruit Company</a>; a journey which convinced him that Company&apos;s capitalist system was a terrible one. This affirmed indignation carried the more aggressive tone he adopted in order to frighten his more Conservative relatives, and ends with Guevara swearing on an image of the then recently deceased <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stalin" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>, not to rest until these &quot;octopuses have been vanquished&quot;. Later that month, Guevara arrived in Guatemala where President <a href="/wiki/Jacobo_%C3%81rbenz_Guzm%C3%A1n" class="mw-redirect" title="Jacobo &#xC1;rbenz Guzm&#xE1;n">Jacobo &#xC1;rbenz Guzm&#xE1;n</a> headed a democratically elected government that, through <a href="/wiki/Land_reform" title="Land reform">land reform</a> and other initiatives, was attempting to end the <i><a href="/wiki/Latifundia" class="mw-redirect" title="Latifundia">latifundia</a></i> system. To accomplish this, President &#xC1;rbenz had enacted a major land reform program, where all uncultivated portions of large land holdings were to be expropriated and redistributed to landless peasants. The biggest land owner, and one most affected by the reforms, was the <a href="/wiki/United_Fruit_Company" title="United Fruit Company">United Fruit Company</a>, from which the &#xC1;rbenz government had already taken more than 225,000 acres (91,000&#xA0;ha) of uncultivated land. Pleased with the road the nation was heading down, Guevara decided to settle down in Guatemala so as to &quot;perfect himself and accomplish whatever may be necessary in order to become a true revolutionary.&quot;</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Guatemala_City" title="Guatemala City">Guatemala City</a>, Guevara sought out <a href="/wiki/Hilda_Gadea" title="Hilda Gadea">Hilda Gadea Acosta</a>, a Peruvian economist who was well-connected politically as a member of the left-leaning <a href="/wiki/Alianza_Popular_Revolucionaria_Americana" class="mw-redirect" title="Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana">Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana</a> (APRA, American Popular Revolutionary Alliance). She introduced Guevara to a number of high-level officials in the <a href="/wiki/Jacobo_Arbenz_Guzm%C3%A1n#Presidency_and_coup" class="mw-redirect" title="Jacobo Arbenz Guzm&#xE1;n">Arbenz government</a>. Guevara then established contact with a group of Cuban exiles linked to <a href="/wiki/Fidel_Castro" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a> through the July 26, 1953, <a href="/wiki/Moncada_Barracks#Attack_on_Moncada_Barracks" title="Moncada Barracks">attack</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Moncada_Barracks" title="Moncada Barracks">Moncada Barracks</a> in <a href="/wiki/Santiago_de_Cuba" title="Santiago de Cuba">Santiago de Cuba</a>. During this period, he acquired his famous nickname, due to his frequent use of the Argentine <a href="/wiki/Diminutive" title="Diminutive">diminutive</a> <a href="/wiki/Interjection" title="Interjection">interjection</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Che_(Spanish)" class="mw-redirect" title="Che (Spanish)">che</a></i>, a <a href="/wiki/Vocative" class="mw-redirect" title="Vocative">vocative</a> casual speech filler used to call attention or ascertain comprehension, similarly to both &quot;bro&quot; or the Canadian phrase &quot;<a href="/wiki/Eh" title="Eh">eh</a>&quot;. During his time in Guatemala, Guevara was helped by other Central American exiles, one of whom, <a href="/wiki/Helena_Leiva_de_Holst" title="Helena Leiva de Holst">Helena Leiva de Holst</a>, provided him with food and lodging, discussed her travels to study Marxism in Russia and China, and to whom, Guevara dedicated a poem, &quot; &quot;Invitaci&#xF3;n al camino&quot;.</p>
<p>On May 15, 1954, a shipment of <a href="/wiki/%C5%A0koda_Works" title="&#x160;koda Works">&#x160;koda</a> infantry and light artillery weapons was dispatched from <a href="/wiki/Czechoslovakia#Communist_Czechoslovakia" title="Czechoslovakia">Communist Czechoslovakia</a> for the Arbenz Government and arrived in <a href="/wiki/Puerto_Barrios" title="Puerto Barrios">Puerto Barrios</a>. As a result, the United States government&#x2014;which since 1953 had been tasked by <a href="/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower" title="Dwight D. Eisenhower">President Eisenhower</a> to remove Arbenz from power in the multifaceted CIA operation code named <a href="/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat" title="1954 Guatemalan coup d&apos;&#xE9;tat">PBSUCCESS</a>&#x2014;responded by saturating Guatemala with anti-Arbenz propaganda through radio and dropped leaflets, and began bombing raids using unmarked airplanes. The United States also sponsored a force of several hundred Guatemalan refugees and mercenaries who were headed by <a href="/wiki/Carlos_Castillo_Armas" title="Carlos Castillo Armas">Castillo Armas</a> to help remove the Arbenz government. Though the impact of the U.S. actions on subsequent events is debatable, by late June, Arbenz came to the conclusion that resistance against the &quot;giant of the north&quot; was futile and resigned. This allowed Armas and his CIA-assisted forces to march into Guatemala City and establish a <a href="/wiki/Military_junta" class="mw-redirect" title="Military junta">military junta</a>, which would twelve days later on July 8, elect him President. Consequently, the Armas regime then consolidated power by rounding up hundreds of suspected communists and executed hundreds of prisoners, while crushing the previously flourishing labor unions and restoring all of United Fruits previous land holdings.</p>
<p>Guevara himself was eager to fight on behalf of Arbenz and joined an armed <a href="/wiki/Militia" title="Militia">militia</a> organized by the Communist Youth for that purpose, but frustrated with the group&apos;s inaction, he soon returned to medical duties. Following the coup, he again volunteered to fight, but soon after, Arbenz took refuge in the Mexican Embassy and told his foreign supporters to leave the country. Guevara&apos;s repeated calls to resist were noted by supporters of the coup, and he was marked for murder. After Hilda Gadea was arrested, Guevara sought protection inside the <a href="/wiki/Diplomatic_missions_of_Argentina" class="mw-redirect" title="Diplomatic missions of Argentina">Argentine consulate</a>, where he remained until he received a safe-conduct pass some weeks later and made his way to <a href="/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>.</p>
<p>The overthrow of the Arbenz regime and establishment of the right-wing Armas dictatorship cemented Guevara&apos;s view of the United States as an <a href="/wiki/Imperialism" title="Imperialism">imperialist</a> power that would oppose and attempt to destroy any government that sought to redress the socioeconomic inequality endemic to Latin America and other developing countries. In speaking about the coup, Guevara stated:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>The last Latin American revolutionary democracy &#x2013; that of Jacobo Arbenz &#x2013; failed as a result of the cold premeditated aggression carried out by the United States. Its visible head was the Secretary of State <a href="/wiki/John_Foster_Dulles" title="John Foster Dulles">John Foster Dulles</a>, a man who, through a rare coincidence, was also a stockholder and attorney for the <a href="/wiki/United_Fruit_Company" title="United Fruit Company">United Fruit Company</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guevara&apos;s conviction that Marxism achieved through armed struggle and defended by an armed populace was the only way to rectify such conditions was thus strengthened. Gadea wrote later, &quot;It was Guatemala which finally convinced him of the necessity for armed struggle and for taking the initiative against imperialism. By the time he left, he was sure of this.&quot;</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Guevara arrived in Mexico City on 21 September 1954, and worked in the allergy section of the <a href="/wiki/General_Hospital_of_Mexico" title="General Hospital of Mexico">General Hospital</a> and at the Hospital Infantil de Mexico. In addition he gave lectures on medicine at the <a href="/wiki/UNAM_Faculty_of_Medicine" title="UNAM Faculty of Medicine">Faculty of Medicine</a> in the <a href="/wiki/National_Autonomous_University_of_Mexico" title="National Autonomous University of Mexico">National Autonomous University of Mexico</a> and worked as a news photographer for <i><a href="/wiki/Prensa_Latina" title="Prensa Latina">Latina News Agency</a></i>. His first wife Hilda notes in her memoir <i>My Life with Che</i>, that for a while, Guevara considered going to work as a doctor in Africa and that he continued to be deeply troubled by the poverty around him. In one instance, Hilda describes Guevara&apos;s obsession with an elderly washerwoman whom he was treating, remarking that he saw her as &quot;representative of the most forgotten and exploited class&quot;. Hilda later found a poem that Che had dedicated to the old woman, containing &quot;a promise to fight for a better world, for a better life for all the poor and exploited.&quot;</p>
<p>During this time he renewed his friendship with &#xD1;ico L&#xF3;pez and the other Cuban exiles whom he had met in Guatemala. In June 1955, L&#xF3;pez introduced him to <a href="/wiki/Ra%C3%BAl_Castro" title="Ra&#xFA;l Castro">Ra&#xFA;l Castro</a> who subsequently introduced him to his older brother, <a href="/wiki/Fidel_Castro" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a>, the revolutionary leader who had formed the <a href="/wiki/26th_of_July_Movement" title="26th of July Movement">26th of July Movement</a> and was now plotting to overthrow the dictatorship of <a href="/wiki/Fulgencio_Batista" title="Fulgencio Batista">Fulgencio Batista</a>. During a long conversation with Fidel on the night of their first meeting, Guevara concluded that the Cuban&apos;s cause was the one for which he had been searching and before daybreak he had signed up as a member of the <a href="/wiki/July_26_Movement" class="mw-redirect" title="July 26 Movement">July 26 Movement</a>. Despite their &quot;contrasting personalities&quot;, from this point on Che and Fidel began to foster what dual biographer Simon Reid-Henry deems a &quot;revolutionary friendship that would change the world&quot;, as a result of their coinciding commitment to <a href="/wiki/Anti-imperialism" title="Anti-imperialism">anti-imperialism</a>.</p>
<p>By this point in Guevara&apos;s life, he deemed that U.S.-controlled <a href="/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)" title="Conglomerate (company)">conglomerates</a> installed and supported repressive regimes around the world. In this vein, he considered Batista a &quot;<a href="/wiki/Puppet_state" title="Puppet state">U.S. puppet</a> whose strings needed cutting&quot;. Although he planned to be the group&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Combat_medic" title="Combat medic">combat medic</a>, Guevara participated in the military training with the members of the Movement. The key portion of training involved learning hit and run tactics of <a href="/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare" title="Guerrilla warfare">guerrilla warfare</a>. Guevara and the others underwent arduous 15-hour marches over mountains, across rivers, and through the dense undergrowth, learning and perfecting the procedures of ambush and quick retreat. From the start Guevara was <a href="/wiki/Alberto_Bayo" title="Alberto Bayo">Alberto Bayo&apos;s</a> &quot;prize student&quot; among those in training, scoring the highest on all of the tests given. At the end of the course, he was called &quot;the best guerrilla of them all&quot; by their instructor, General Bayo.</p>
<p>Guevara then married Gadea in Mexico in September 1955, before embarking on his plan to assist in the liberation of Cuba.</p>

Guevara atop a mule in <a href="/wiki/Santa_Clara_Province" title="Santa Clara Province">Las Villas province</a>, Cuba, November 1958</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The first step in Castro&apos;s revolutionary plan was an assault on Cuba from Mexico via the <i><a href="/wiki/Granma_(yacht)" title="Granma (yacht)">Granma</a>,</i> an old, leaky <a href="/wiki/Cabin_cruiser" title="Cabin cruiser">cabin cruiser</a>. They set out for Cuba on November 25, 1956. Attacked by Batista&apos;s military soon after landing, many of the 82 men were either killed in the attack or executed upon capture; only 22 found each other afterwards. During this initial bloody confrontation Guevara laid down his medical supplies and picked up a box of ammunition dropped by a fleeing comrade, proving to be a symbolic moment in Che&apos;s life.</p>
<p>Only a small band of revolutionaries survived to re-group as a bedraggled fighting force deep in the <a href="/wiki/Sierra_Maestra" title="Sierra Maestra">Sierra Maestra</a> mountains, where they received support from the <a href="/wiki/Urban_guerrilla_warfare" title="Urban guerrilla warfare">urban guerrilla</a> network of <a href="/wiki/Frank_Pa%C3%ADs" title="Frank Pa&#xED;s">Frank Pa&#xED;s</a>, the 26th of July Movement, and local campesinos. With the group withdrawn to the Sierra, the world wondered whether Castro was alive or dead until early 1957 when the interview by <a href="/wiki/Herbert_Matthews" title="Herbert Matthews">Herbert Matthews</a> appeared in <i>The New York Times</i>. The article presented a lasting, almost mythical image for Castro and the guerrillas. Guevara was not present for the interview, but in the coming months he began to realize the importance of the media in their struggle. Meanwhile, as supplies and morale diminished, and with an allergy to mosquito bites which resulted in agonizing walnut-sized <a href="/wiki/Cysts" class="mw-redirect" title="Cysts">cysts</a> on his body, Guevara considered these &quot;the most painful days of the war&quot;.</p>
<p>During Guevara&apos;s time living hidden among the poor <a href="/wiki/Subsistence_farmers" class="mw-redirect" title="Subsistence farmers">subsistence farmers</a> of the Sierra Maestra mountains, he discovered that there were no schools, no electricity, minimal access to healthcare, and more than 40 percent of the adults were <a href="/wiki/Illiterate" class="mw-redirect" title="Illiterate">illiterate</a>. As the war continued, Guevara became an integral part of the rebel army and &quot;convinced Castro with competence, diplomacy and patience&quot;. Guevara set up factories to make grenades, built ovens to bake bread, taught new recruits about tactics, and organized schools to teach illiterate campesinos to read and write. Moreover, Guevara established health clinics, workshops to teach military tactics, and a newspaper to disseminate information. The man who three years later would be dubbed by <i><a href="/wiki/Time_Magazine" class="mw-redirect" title="Time Magazine">Time Magazine</a></i>: &quot;Castro&apos;s brain&quot;, at this point was promoted by <a href="/wiki/Fidel_Castro" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a> to <i>Comandante</i> (commander) of a second army column.</p>
<p>As second in command, Guevara was a harsh disciplinarian who sometimes shot defectors. Deserters were punished as traitors, and Guevara was known to send squads to track those seeking to go <a href="/wiki/AWOL" class="mw-redirect" title="AWOL">AWOL</a>. As a result, Guevara became feared for his brutality and ruthlessness. During the guerrilla campaign, Guevara was also responsible for the sometimes <a href="/wiki/Summary_execution" title="Summary execution">summary execution</a> of a number of men accused of being <a href="/wiki/Informant" title="Informant">informers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Desertion" title="Desertion">deserters</a> or <a href="/wiki/Espionage" title="Espionage">spies</a>. In his diaries, Guevara described the first such execution of <a href="/wiki/Eutimio_Guerra" class="mw-redirect" title="Eutimio Guerra">Eutimio Guerra</a>, a peasant army guide who admitted treason when it was discovered he accepted the promise of ten thousand pesos for repeatedly giving away the rebel&apos;s position for attack by the Cuban air force. Such information also allowed Batista&apos;s army to burn the homes of peasants sympathetic to the revolution. Upon Guerra&apos;s request that they &quot;end his life quickly&quot;, Che stepped forward and shot him in the head, writing &quot;The situation was uncomfortable for the people and for Eutimio so I ended the problem giving him a shot with a .32 pistol in the right side of the brain, with exit orifice in the right temporal [lobe].&quot; His scientific notations and matter-of-fact description, suggested to one biographer a &quot;remarkable detachment to violence&quot; by that point in the war. Later, Guevara published a literary account of the incident, titled &quot;Death of a Traitor&quot;, where he transfigured Eutimio&apos;s betrayal and pre-execution request that the revolution &quot;take care of his children&quot;, into a &quot;revolutionary <a href="/wiki/Parable" title="Parable">parable</a> about redemption through sacrifice&quot;.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Although he maintained a demanding and harsh disposition, Guevara also viewed his role of commander as one of a teacher, entertaining his men during breaks between engagements with readings from the likes of <a href="/wiki/Robert_Louis_Stevenson" title="Robert Louis Stevenson">Robert Louis Stevenson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cervantes" class="mw-redirect" title="Cervantes">Cervantes</a>, and Spanish <a href="/wiki/Lyric_poetry" title="Lyric poetry">lyric poets</a>. Together with this role, and inspired by <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mart%C3%AD" title="Jos&#xE9; Mart&#xED;">Jos&#xE9; Mart&#xED;</a>&apos;s principle of &quot;literacy without borders&quot;, Guevara further ensured that his rebel fighters made daily time to teach the uneducated campesinos with whom they lived and fought to read and write, in what Guevara termed the &quot;battle against ignorance&quot;. Tom&#xE1;s Alba, who fought under Guevara&apos;s command, later stated that &quot;Che was loved, in spite of being stern and demanding. We would (have) given our life for him.&quot;</p>
<p>His commanding officer <a href="/wiki/Fidel_Castro" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a> has described Guevara as intelligent, daring, and an exemplary leader who &quot;had great moral authority over his troops&quot;. Castro further remarked that Guevara took too many risks, even having a &quot;tendency toward foolhardiness&quot;. Guevara&apos;s teenage lieutenant, Joel Iglesias, recounts such actions in his diary, noting that Guevara&apos;s behavior in combat even brought admiration from the enemy. On one occasion Iglesias recounts the time he had been wounded in battle, stating &quot;Che ran out to me, defying the bullets, threw me over his shoulder, and got me out of there. The guards didn&apos;t dare fire at him&#xA0;... later they told me he made a great impression on them when they saw him run out with his pistol stuck in his belt, ignoring the danger, they didn&apos;t dare shoot.&quot;</p>
<p>Guevara was instrumental in creating the <a href="/wiki/Pirate_radio" title="Pirate radio">clandestine radio station</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Radio_Rebelde" title="Radio Rebelde">Radio Rebelde</a></i> (Rebel Radio) in February 1958, which broadcast news to the Cuban people with statements by the 26th of July movement, and provided <a href="/wiki/Radiotelephone" title="Radiotelephone">radiotelephone</a> communication between the growing number of rebel columns across the island. Guevara had apparently been inspired to create the station by observing the effectiveness of <a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</a> supplied radio in Guatemala in ousting the government of <a href="/wiki/Jacobo_Arbenz_Guzm%C3%A1n" class="mw-redirect" title="Jacobo Arbenz Guzm&#xE1;n">Jacobo Arbenz Guzm&#xE1;n</a>.</p>
<p>To quell the rebellion, Cuban government troops began executing rebel prisoners on the spot, and regularly rounded up, tortured, and shot civilians as a tactic of intimidation. By March 1958, the continued atrocities carried out by Batista&apos;s forces led the United States to announce it would stop selling arms to the Cuban government. Then in late July 1958, Guevara played a critical role in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Las_Mercedes" title="Battle of Las Mercedes">Battle of Las Mercedes</a> by using his column to halt a force of 1,500 men called up by Batista&apos;s General Cantillo in a plan to encircle and destroy Castro&apos;s forces. Years later, <a href="/wiki/Major_(United_States)" title="Major (United States)">Major</a> Larry Bockman of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps" title="United States Marine Corps">United States Marine Corps</a> would analyze and describe Che&apos;s tactical appreciation of this battle as &quot;brilliant&quot;. During this time Guevara also became an &quot;expert&quot; at leading hit-and-run tactics against Batista&apos;s army, and then fading back into the countryside before the army could counterattack.</p>

<p>As the war extended, Guevara led a new column of fighters dispatched westward for the final push towards <a href="/wiki/Havana" title="Havana">Havana</a>. Travelling by foot, Guevara embarked on a difficult 7-week march only travelling at night to avoid ambush, and often not eating for several days. In the closing days of December 1958, Guevara&apos;s task was to cut the island in half by taking <a href="/wiki/Las_Villas_(Cuba)" class="mw-redirect" title="Las Villas (Cuba)">Las Villas</a> province. In a matter of days he executed a series of &quot;brilliant tactical victories&quot; that gave him control of all but the province&apos;s capital city of <a href="/wiki/Santa_Clara,_Cuba" title="Santa Clara, Cuba">Santa Clara</a>. Guevara then directed his &quot;suicide squad&quot; in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Santa_Clara" title="Battle of Santa Clara">attack on Santa Clara</a>, that became the final decisive military victory of the revolution. In the six weeks leading up to the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Santa_Clara" title="Battle of Santa Clara">Battle of Santa Clara</a> there were times when his men were completely surrounded, outgunned, and overrun. Che&apos;s eventual victory despite being outnumbered 10:1, remains in the view of some observers a &quot;remarkable tour de force in modern warfare&quot;.</p>
<p>Radio Rebelde broadcast the first reports that Guevara&apos;s column had <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Santa_Clara" title="Battle of Santa Clara">taken Santa Clara</a> on New Year&apos;s Eve 1958. This contradicted reports by the heavily controlled national news media, which had at one stage reported Guevara&apos;s death during the fighting. At 3 am on January 1, 1959, upon learning that his generals were negotiating a separate peace with Guevara, <a href="/wiki/Fulgencio_Batista" title="Fulgencio Batista">Fulgencio Batista</a> boarded a plane in Havana and fled for the <a href="/wiki/Dominican_Republic" title="Dominican Republic">Dominican Republic</a>, along with an amassed &quot;fortune of more than $300,000,000 through graft and payoffs&quot;. The following day on January 2, Guevara entered <a href="/wiki/Havana" title="Havana">Havana</a> to take final control of the capital. Fidel Castro took 6 more days to arrive, as he stopped to rally support in several large cities on his way to rolling victoriously into Havana on January 8, 1959. The final death toll from the two years of revolutionary fighting was 2,000 people.</p>
<p>In mid-January 1959, Guevara went to live at a summer villa in <a href="/wiki/Tarara" class="mw-redirect" title="Tarara">Tarara</a> to recover from a violent asthma attack. While there he started the Tarara Group, a group that debated and formed the new plans for Cuba&apos;s social, political, and economic development. In addition, Che began to write his book <i><a href="/wiki/Guerrilla_Warfare_(book)" title="Guerrilla Warfare (book)">Guerrilla Warfare</a></i> while resting at Tarara. In February, the revolutionary government proclaimed Guevara &quot;a Cuban citizen by birth&quot; in recognition of his role in the triumph. When <a href="/wiki/Hilda_Gadea" title="Hilda Gadea">Hilda Gadea</a> arrived in Cuba in late January, Guevara told her that he was involved with another woman, and the two agreed on a divorce, which was finalized on May 22. On June 2, 1959, he married <a href="/wiki/Aleida_March" title="Aleida March">Aleida March</a>, a Cuban-born member of the 26th of July movement with whom he had been living since late 1958. Guevara returned to the seaside village of Tarara in June for his honeymoon with Aleida. In total, Guevara would ultimately have five children from his two marriages.</p>

</div>
<p>The first major political crisis arose over what to do with the captured Batista officials who had been responsible for the worst of the repression. During the rebellion against Batista&apos;s dictatorship, the general command of the rebel army, led by Fidel Castro, introduced into the territories under its control the 19th century penal law commonly known as the <i>Ley de la Sierra</i> (Law of the Sierra). This law included the death penalty for serious crimes, whether perpetrated by the Batista regime or by supporters of the revolution. In 1959, the revolutionary government extended its application to the whole of the republic and to those it considered war criminals, captured and tried after the revolution. According to the Cuban Ministry of Justice, this latter extension was supported by the majority of the population, and followed the same procedure as those in the <a href="/wiki/Nuremberg_Trials" class="mw-redirect" title="Nuremberg Trials">Nuremberg Trials</a> held by the <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II" title="Allies of World War II">Allies</a> after World War II.</p>
<p>To implement a portion of this plan, Castro named Guevara commander of the <a href="/wiki/La_Caba%C3%B1a_Fortress" class="mw-redirect" title="La Caba&#xF1;a Fortress">La Caba&#xF1;a Fortress</a> prison, for a five-month tenure (January 2 through June 12, 1959). Guevara was charged with purging the Batista army and consolidating victory by exacting &quot;revolutionary justice&quot; against those considered to be traitors, <i>chivatos</i> (informants) or <a href="/wiki/War_criminals" class="mw-redirect" title="War criminals">war criminals</a>. Serving in the post as commander of La Caba&#xF1;a, Guevara reviewed the appeals of those convicted during the revolutionary tribunal process. The tribunals were conducted by 2&#x2013;3 army officers, an assessor, and a respected local citizen. On some occasions the penalty delivered by the tribunal was death by firing squad. Ra&#xFA;l G&#xF3;mez Treto, senior legal advisor to the Cuban Ministry of Justice, has argued that the death penalty was justified in order to prevent citizens themselves from taking justice into their own hands, as happened twenty years earlier in the anti-<a href="/wiki/Gerardo_Machado" title="Gerardo Machado">Machado</a> rebellion. Biographers note that in January 1959, the Cuban public was in a &quot;lynching mood&quot;, and point to a survey at the time showing 93% public approval for the tribunal process. Moreover, a January 22, 1959, <a href="/wiki/Universal_Newsreel" title="Universal Newsreel">Universal Newsreel</a> broadcast in the United States and narrated by <a href="/wiki/Ed_Herlihy" title="Ed Herlihy">Ed Herlihy</a>, featured Fidel Castro asking an estimated one million Cubans whether they approved of the executions, and was met with a roaring &quot;<i>&#xA1;Si!</i>&quot; (yes). With thousands of Cubans estimated to have been killed at the hands of Batista&apos;s collaborators, and many of the war criminals sentenced to death accused of <a href="/wiki/Torture" title="Torture">torture</a> and physical atrocities, the newly empowered government carried out executions, punctuated by cries from the crowds of <i>&quot;&#xA1;pared&#xF3;n!&quot;</i> ([to the] wall!), which biographer <a href="/wiki/Jorge_Casta%C3%B1eda_Gutman" title="Jorge Casta&#xF1;eda Gutman">Jorge Casta&#xF1;eda</a> describes as &quot;without respect for <a href="/wiki/Due_process" title="Due process">due process</a>&quot;.</p>

<p>I have yet to find a single credible source pointing to a case where Che executed &quot;an innocent&quot;. Those persons executed by Guevara or on his orders were condemned for the usual crimes punishable by death at times of war or in its aftermath: desertion, treason or crimes such as rape, torture or murder. I should add that my research spanned five years, and included anti-Castro Cubans among the Cuban-American exile community in Miami and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Although there are varying accounts, it is estimated that several hundred people were executed nationwide during this time, with Guevara&apos;s jurisdictional death total at La Caba&#xF1;a ranging from 55 to 105 (see reference). Conflicting views exist of Guevara&apos;s attitude towards the executions at La Caba&#xF1;a. Some exiled opposition biographers report that he relished the rituals of the firing squad, and organized them with gusto, while others relate that Guevara pardoned as many prisoners as he could. What is acknowledged by all sides is that Guevara had become a &quot;hardened&quot; man, who had no qualms about the death penalty or summary and collective trials. If the only way to &quot;defend the revolution was to execute its enemies, he would not be swayed by humanitarian or political arguments&quot;. This is further confirmed by a February 5, 1959, letter to Luis Paredes L&#xF3;pez in <a href="/wiki/Buenos_Aires" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a> where Guevara states unequivocally &quot;The executions by firing squads are not only a necessity for the people of Cuba, but also an imposition of the people.&quot;</p>
<p>Along with ensuring &quot;revolutionary justice&quot;, the other key early platform of Guevara&apos;s was establishing agrarian <a href="/wiki/Land_reform" title="Land reform">land reform</a>. Almost immediately after the success of the revolution on January 27, 1959, Guevara made one of his most significant speeches where he talked about &quot;the social ideas of the rebel army&quot;. During this speech, he declared that the main concern of the new Cuban government was &quot;the social justice that <a href="/wiki/Land_redistribution" class="mw-redirect" title="Land redistribution">land redistribution</a> brings about&quot;. A few months later on May 17, 1959, the <a href="/wiki/Agrarian_Reform_Laws_of_Cuba" class="mw-redirect" title="Agrarian Reform Laws of Cuba">Agrarian Reform Law</a> crafted by Guevara went into effect, limiting the size of all farms to 1,000 acres (400&#xA0;ha). Any holdings over these limits were expropriated by the government and either redistributed to peasants in 67-acre (270,000&#xA0;m) parcels or held as state run communes. The law also stipulated that sugar plantations could not be owned by foreigners.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>On June 12, 1959, Castro sent Guevara out on a three-month tour of 14 mostly <a href="/wiki/Asian-African_Conference" class="mw-redirect" title="Asian-African Conference">Bandung Pact</a> countries (Morocco, Sudan, Egypt, Syria, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, <a href="/wiki/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, Japan, <a href="/wiki/Yugoslavia" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>, Greece) and the cities of Singapore and Hong Kong. Sending Guevara away from Havana allowed Castro to appear to be distancing himself from Guevara and his <a href="/wiki/Marxism" title="Marxism">Marxist</a> sympathies, which troubled both the United States and some of Castro&apos;s July 26 Movement members. While in <a href="/wiki/Jakarta" title="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>, Guevara visited Indonesian president <a href="/wiki/Sukarno" title="Sukarno">Sukarno</a> to discuss the recent <a href="/wiki/Indonesian_revolution" class="mw-redirect" title="Indonesian revolution">revolution in Indonesia</a> and to establish trade relations between their two nations. Both men quickly bonded, as Sukarno was attracted to Guevara&apos;s energy and his relaxed informal approach; moreover they shared revolutionary <a href="/wiki/Leftist" class="mw-redirect" title="Leftist">leftist</a> aspirations against <a href="/wiki/Western_imperialism" class="mw-redirect" title="Western imperialism">western imperialism</a>. Guevara next spent 12 days in Japan (July 15&#x2013;27), participating in negotiations aimed at expanding Cuba&apos;s trade relations with that nation. During the visit, he refused to visit and lay a wreath at Japan&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Tomb_of_the_Unknown_Soldier" title="Tomb of the Unknown Soldier">Tomb of the Unknown Soldier</a> commemorating soldiers lost during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, remarking that the Japanese &quot;imperialists&quot; had &quot;killed millions of Asians&quot;. In its place, Guevara stated that he would instead visit <a href="/wiki/Hiroshima" title="Hiroshima">Hiroshima</a>, where the American military had <a href="/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki" title="Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki">detonated</a> an <a href="/wiki/Little_Boy" title="Little Boy">atom-bomb</a> 14 years earlier. Despite his denunciation of <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Japan" class="mw-redirect" title="Imperial Japan">Imperial Japan</a>, Guevara also considered <a href="/wiki/Harry_S._Truman" title="Harry S. Truman">President Truman</a> a &quot;macabre clown&quot; for the bombings, and after visiting Hiroshima and its <a href="/wiki/Hiroshima_Peace_Memorial_Museum" title="Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum">Peace Memorial Museum</a>, he sent back a postcard to Cuba stating &quot;In order to fight better for peace, one must look at Hiroshima.&quot;</p>
<p>Upon Guevara&apos;s return to Cuba in September 1959, it was evident that Castro now had more political power. The government had begun land seizures included in the agrarian reform law, but was hedging on compensation offers to landowners, instead offering low interest &quot;bonds&quot;, a step which put the United States on alert. At this point the affected wealthy cattlemen of <a href="/wiki/Camag%C3%BCey" title="Camag&#xFC;ey">Camag&#xFC;ey</a> mounted a campaign against the land redistributions, and enlisted the newly disaffected rebel leader <a href="/wiki/Huber_Matos" title="Huber Matos">Huber Matos</a>, who along with the anti-Communist wing of the 26th of July Movement, joined them in denouncing the &quot;Communist encroachment&quot;. During this time Dominican dictator <a href="/wiki/Rafael_Trujillo" title="Rafael Trujillo">Rafael Trujillo</a> was offering assistance to the &quot;<a href="/wiki/Anti-Communist_Legion_of_the_Caribbean" class="mw-redirect" title="Anti-Communist Legion of the Caribbean">Anti-Communist Legion of the Caribbean</a>&quot; which was training in the Dominican Republic. This multi-national force, composed mostly of Spaniards and Cubans, but also of Croatians, Germans, Greeks, and right-wing mercenaries, was plotting to topple Castro&apos;s new regime.</p>

<p>Such threats were heightened when, on March 4, 1960, two massive explosions ripped through the French freighter <i><a href="/wiki/La_Coubre_explosion" title="La Coubre explosion">La Coubre</a></i>, which was carrying <a href="/wiki/FN_FAL" title="FN FAL">Belgian munitions</a> from the port of <a href="/wiki/Antwerp" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, and was docked in <a href="/wiki/Havana_Harbor" title="Havana Harbor">Havana Harbor</a>. The blasts killed at least 76 people and injured several hundred, with Guevara personally providing first aid to some of the victims. Cuban leader Fidel Castro immediately accused the CIA of &quot;an act of terrorism&quot; and held a state funeral the following day for the victims of the blast. It was at the memorial service that <a href="/wiki/Alberto_Korda" title="Alberto Korda">Alberto Korda</a> took the famous photograph of Guevara, now known as <i><a href="/wiki/Che_Guevara_(photo)" class="mw-redirect" title="Che Guevara (photo)">Guerrillero Heroico</a></i>.</p>
<p>These perceived threats prompted Castro to further eliminate &quot;<a href="/wiki/Counter-revolutionaries" class="mw-redirect" title="Counter-revolutionaries">counter-revolutionaries</a>&quot;, and to utilize Guevara to drastically increase the speed of <a href="/wiki/Land_reform" title="Land reform">land reform</a>. To implement this plan, a new government agency, the <a href="/wiki/National_Institute_of_Agrarian_Reform" class="mw-redirect" title="National Institute of Agrarian Reform">National Institute of Agrarian Reform</a> (INRA), was established to administer the new Agrarian Reform law. INRA quickly became the most important governing body in the nation, with Guevara serving as its head in his capacity as minister of industries. Under Guevara&apos;s command, INRA established its own 100,000 person militia, used first to help the government seize control of the expropriated land and supervise its distribution, and later to set up cooperative farms. The land confiscated included 480,000 acres (190,000&#xA0;ha) owned by United States corporations. Months later, as retaliation, <a href="/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower" title="Dwight D. Eisenhower">U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> sharply reduced United States imports of Cuban sugar (Cuba&apos;s main cash crop), thus leading Guevara on July 10, 1960, to address over 100,000 workers in front of the <a href="/wiki/Museum_of_the_Revolution_(Cuba)" title="Museum of the Revolution (Cuba)">Presidential Palace</a> at a rally called to denounce United States &quot;economic aggression&quot;. <i><a href="/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time magazine</a></i> reporters who met with Guevara around this time, described him as &quot;guid(ing) Cuba with icy calculation, vast competence, high intelligence, and a perceptive sense of humor.&quot;</p>
<p>Along with land reform, one of the primary areas that Guevara stressed needed national improvement was in the area of <a href="/wiki/Literacy" title="Literacy">literacy</a>. Before 1959 the official literacy rate for Cuba was between 60&#x2013;76%, with educational access in rural areas and a lack of instructors the main determining factors. As a result, the Cuban government at Guevara&apos;s behest dubbed 1961 the &quot;year of education&quot;, and mobilized over 100,000 volunteers into &quot;literacy brigades&quot;, who were then sent out into the countryside to construct schools, train new educators, and teach the predominantly illiterate <i>guajiros</i> (peasants) to read and write. Unlike many of Guevara&apos;s later economic initiatives, this campaign was &quot;a remarkable success&quot;. By the completion of the <a href="/wiki/Cuban_Literacy_Campaign" title="Cuban Literacy Campaign">Cuban Literacy Campaign</a>, 707,212 adults had been taught to read and write, raising the national literacy rate to 96%.</p>

<p>Accompanying literacy, Guevara was also concerned with establishing universal access to higher education. To accomplish this, the new regime introduced <a href="/wiki/Affirmative_action" title="Affirmative action">affirmative action</a> to the universities. While announcing this new commitment, Guevara told the gathered faculty and students at the <a href="/wiki/University_%22Marta_Abreu%22_of_Las_Villas" title="University &quot;Marta Abreu&quot; of Las Villas">University of Las Villas</a> that the days when education was &quot;a privilege of the white middle class&quot; had ended. &quot;The University&quot; he said, &quot;must paint itself black, mulatto, worker, and peasant.&quot; If it did not, he warned, the people would break down its doors &quot;and paint the University the colors they like.&quot;</p>

<p>At this stage, Guevara acquired the additional position of Finance Minister, as well as President of the National Bank. These appointments, combined with his existing position as Minister of Industries, placed Guevara at the zenith of his power, as the &quot;virtual czar&quot; of the Cuban economy. As a consequence of his position at the head of the central bank, it was now Guevara&apos;s duty to sign the Cuban currency, which per custom would bear his signature. Instead of using his full name, he signed the bills solely &quot;<i>Che</i>&quot;. It was through this symbolic act, which horrified many in the Cuban financial sector, that Guevara signaled his distaste for money and the class distinctions it brought about. Guevara&apos;s long time friend Ricardo Rojo later remarked that &quot;the day he signed <i>Che</i> on the bills, (he) literally knocked the props from under the widespread belief that money was sacred.&quot;</p>

Believing that the attitudes in Cuba towards race, women, <a href="/wiki/Individualism" title="Individualism">individualism</a>, and manual labor were the product of the island&apos;s outdated past, Guevara urged all individuals to view each other as equals and take on the values of what he termed <i>&quot;el Hombre Nuevo&quot;</i> (the New Man). Guevara hoped his &quot;new man&quot; would ultimately be &quot;selfless and cooperative, obedient and hard working, <a href="/wiki/Gender-blind" title="Gender-blind">gender-blind</a>, incorruptible, <a href="/wiki/Anti-consumerism" title="Anti-consumerism">non-materialistic</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Anti-imperialism" title="Anti-imperialism">anti-imperialist</a>.&quot; To accomplish this, Guevara emphasized the tenets of <a href="/wiki/Marxism-Leninism" class="mw-redirect" title="Marxism-Leninism">Marxism-Leninism</a>, and wanted to use the state to emphasize qualities such as <a href="/wiki/Egalitarianism" title="Egalitarianism">egalitarianism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Self-sacrifice" class="mw-redirect" title="Self-sacrifice">self-sacrifice</a>, at the same time as &quot;unity, equality, and freedom&quot; became the new maxims. Guevara&apos;s first desired economic goal of the new man, which coincided with his aversion for <a href="/wiki/Wealth_condensation" class="mw-redirect" title="Wealth condensation">wealth condensation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Economic_inequality" title="Economic inequality">economic inequality</a>, was to see a nationwide elimination of material incentives in favor of <a href="/wiki/Morality" title="Morality">moral</a> ones. He negatively viewed capitalism as a &quot;contest among wolves&quot; where &quot;one can only win at the cost of others&quot; and thus desired to see the creation of a &quot;new man and woman&quot;. Guevara continually stressed that a socialist economy in itself is not &quot;worth the effort, sacrifice, and risks of war and destruction&quot; if it ends up encouraging &quot;greed and individual ambition at the expense of <a href="/wiki/Collectivism" title="Collectivism">collective spirit</a>&quot;. A primary goal of Guevara&apos;s thus became to reform &quot;individual consciousness&quot; and values to produce better workers and citizens. In his view, Cuba&apos;s &quot;new man&quot; would be able to overcome the &quot;<a href="/wiki/Egotism" title="Egotism">egotism</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="/wiki/Selfishness" title="Selfishness">selfishness</a>&quot; that he loathed and discerned was uniquely characteristic of individuals in capitalist societies. To promote this concept of a &quot;new man&quot;, the government also created a series of party-dominated institutions and mechanisms on all levels of society, which included organizations such as <a href="/wiki/Labour_movement" title="Labour movement">labor groups</a>, <a href="/wiki/Young_Communist_League" title="Young Communist League">youth leagues</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_women%27s_organizations" title="List of women&apos;s organizations">women&apos;s groups</a>, <a href="/wiki/Community_centre" title="Community centre">community centers</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Palace_of_Culture" title="Palace of Culture">houses of culture</a> to promote state-sponsored art, music, and literature. In congruence with this, all educational, mass media, and artistic community based facilities were nationalized and utilized to instill the government&apos;s official <a href="/wiki/Socialism_(Marxism)" class="mw-redirect" title="Socialism (Marxism)">socialist</a> ideology. In describing this new method of &quot;development&quot;, Guevara stated:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>There is a great difference between free-enterprise development and revolutionary development. In one of them, wealth is concentrated in the hands of a fortunate few, the friends of the government, the best wheeler-dealers. In the other, wealth is the people&apos;s patrimony.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A further integral part of fostering a sense of &quot;unity between the individual and the mass&quot;, Guevara believed, was volunteer work and will. To display this, Guevara &quot;led by example&quot;, working &quot;endlessly at his ministry job, in construction, and even cutting sugar cane&quot; on his day off. He was known for working 36 hours at a stretch, calling meetings after midnight, and eating on the run. Such behavior was emblematic of Guevara&apos;s new program of moral incentives, where each worker was now required to meet a quota and produce a certain quantity of goods. As a replacement for the pay increases abolished by Guevara, workers who exceeded their quota now only received a certificate of commendation, while workers who failed to meet their quotas were given a pay cut. Guevara unapologetically defended his personal philosophy towards motivation and work, stating:</p>

<p>In the face of a loss of commercial connections with Western states, Guevara tried to replace them with closer commercial relationships with <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Bloc" title="Eastern Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a> states, visiting a number of Marxist states and signing trade agreements with them. At the end of 1960 he visited <a href="/wiki/Czechoslovakia" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, North Korea, Hungary and <a href="/wiki/East_Germany" title="East Germany">East Germany</a> and signed, for instance, a trade agreement in <a href="/wiki/East_Berlin" title="East Berlin">East Berlin</a> on December 17, 1960. Such agreements helped Cuba&apos;s economy to a certain degree but also had the disadvantage of a growing economic dependency on the Eastern Bloc. It was also in East Germany where Guevara met <a href="/wiki/Tamara_Bunke" title="Tamara Bunke">Tamara Bunke</a> (later known as &quot;Tania&quot;), who was assigned as his interpreter, and who would years later join him, and be killed with him in Bolivia.</p>
<p>Whatever the merits or demerits of Guevara&apos;s economic principles, his programs were unsuccessful. Guevara&apos;s program of &quot;moral incentives&quot; for workers caused a rapid drop in productivity and a rapid rise in absenteeism. Decades later, the director of <a href="/wiki/Radio_y_Televisi%C3%B3n_Mart%C3%AD" title="Radio y Televisi&#xF3;n Mart&#xED;">Radio Mart&#xED;</a> Ernesto Betancourt, an early ally turned Castro-critic and Che&apos;s former deputy, would accuse Guevara of being &quot;ignorant of the most elementary economic principles.&quot; In reference to the collective failings of Guevara&apos;s vision, reporter <a href="/wiki/I.F._Stone" class="mw-redirect" title="I.F. Stone">I.F.

Only there could the purity of the faith be safeguarded from the unregenerate revisionism of <a href="/wiki/Human_nature" title="Human nature">human nature</a>.&quot;</p>
<p><span id="gunaccident"></span> On April 17, 1961, 1,400 U.S.-trained Cuban exiles invaded Cuba during the <a href="/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion" title="Bay of Pigs Invasion">Bay of Pigs Invasion</a>. Guevara did not play a key role in the fighting, as one day before the invasion a warship carrying Marines faked an invasion off the West Coast of <a href="/wiki/Pinar_del_R%C3%ADo" title="Pinar del R&#xED;o">Pinar del R&#xED;o</a> and drew forces commanded by Guevara to that region. However, historians give him a share of credit for the victory as he was director of instruction for Cuba&apos;s armed forces at the time. Author <a href="/wiki/Tad_Szulc" title="Tad Szulc">Tad Szulc</a> in his explanation of the Cuban victory, assigns Guevara partial credit, stating: &quot;The revolutionaries won because Che Guevara, as the head of the Instruction Department of the Revolutionary Armed Forces in charge of the militia training program, had done so well in preparing 200,000 men and women for war.&quot; It was also during this deployment that he suffered a bullet grazing to the cheek when his pistol fell out of its holster and accidentally discharged.</p>

<p>In August 1961, during an economic conference of the <a href="/wiki/Organization_of_American_States" title="Organization of American States">Organization of American States</a> in <a href="/wiki/Punta_del_Este" title="Punta del Este">Punta del Este</a>, Uruguay, Che Guevara sent a note of &quot;gratitude&quot; to United States President <a href="/wiki/John_F._Kennedy" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> through <a href="/wiki/Richard_N._Goodwin" title="Richard N. Goodwin">Richard N. Goodwin</a>, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs. It read &quot;Thanks for Playa Gir&#xF3;n (Bay of Pigs). Before the invasion, the revolution was shaky. Now it&apos;s stronger than ever.&quot; In response to United States Treasury Secretary <a href="/wiki/Douglas_Dillon" class="mw-redirect" title="Douglas Dillon">Douglas Dillon</a> presenting the <a href="/wiki/Alliance_for_Progress" title="Alliance for Progress">Alliance for Progress</a> for ratification by the meeting, Guevara antagonistically attacked the United States claim of being a &quot;democracy&quot;, stating that such a system was not compatible with &quot;financial <a href="/wiki/Oligarchy" title="Oligarchy">oligarchy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States" title="Racial segregation in the United States">discrimination against blacks</a>, and outrages by the <a href="/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>&quot;. Guevara continued, speaking out against the &quot;persecution&quot; that in his view &quot;drove scientists like <a href="/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer" title="J. Robert Oppenheimer">Oppenheimer</a> from their posts, deprived the world for years of the marvelous voice of <a href="/wiki/Paul_Robeson" title="Paul Robeson">Paul Robeson</a>, and sent <a href="/wiki/Julius_and_Ethel_Rosenberg" title="Julius and Ethel Rosenberg">the Rosenbergs</a> to their deaths against the protests of a shocked world.&quot; Guevara ended his remarks by insinuating that the United States was not interested in real reforms, sardonically quipping that &quot;U.S. experts never talk about agrarian reform; they prefer a safe subject, like a better water supply. In short, they seem to prepare the revolution of the toilets.&quot;</p>
<p>Guevara, who was practically the architect of the <a href="/wiki/Cuban-Soviet_relations" class="mw-redirect" title="Cuban-Soviet relations">Soviet-Cuban relationship</a>, then played a key role in bringing to Cuba the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapon" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear-armed</a> <a href="/wiki/Ballistic_missile" title="Ballistic missile">ballistic missiles</a> that precipitated the <a href="/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis" title="Cuban Missile Crisis">Cuban Missile Crisis</a> in October 1962 and brought the world to the brink of <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_warfare" title="Nuclear warfare">nuclear war</a>. A few weeks after the crisis, during an interview with the British communist newspaper the <i><a href="/wiki/The_Morning_Star" class="mw-redirect" title="The Morning Star">Daily Worker</a></i>, Guevara was still fuming over the perceived Soviet betrayal and told correspondent Sam Russell that, if the missiles had been under Cuban control, they would have fired them off. While expounding on the incident later, Guevara reiterated that the cause of socialist liberation against global &quot;imperialist aggression&quot; would ultimately have been worth the possibility of &quot;millions of atomic war victims&quot;. The missile crisis further convinced Guevara that the world&apos;s two superpowers (the United States and the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>) used Cuba as a pawn in their own global strategies. Afterward, he denounced the Soviets almost as frequently as he denounced the Americans.</p>

<p>In December 1964, Che Guevara had emerged as a &quot;revolutionary statesman of world stature&quot; and thus traveled to New York City as head of the Cuban delegation to speak at the United Nations. On December 11, 1964, during Guevara&apos;s hour-long, impassioned address at the UN, he criticized the United Nations&apos; inability to confront the &quot;brutal <a href="/wiki/South_Africa_under_apartheid" class="mw-redirect" title="South Africa under apartheid">policy of apartheid</a>&quot; in South Africa, asking &quot;Can the United Nations do nothing to stop this?&quot; Guevara then denounced the <a href="/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws" title="Jim Crow laws">United States policy towards their black population</a>, stating:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>Those who kill their own children and discriminate daily against them because of the color of their skin; those who let the murderers of blacks remain free, protecting them, and furthermore punishing the black population because they demand their legitimate rights as free men&#x2014;how can those who do this consider themselves guardians of freedom?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An indignant Guevara ended his speech by reciting the <i>Second Declaration of Havana</i>, decreeing Latin America a &quot;family of 200 million brothers who suffer the same miseries&quot;. This &quot;epic&quot;, Guevara declared, would be written by the &quot;hungry Indian masses, peasants without land, exploited workers, and progressive masses&quot;. To Guevara the conflict was a struggle of masses and ideas, which would be carried forth by those &quot;mistreated and scorned by <a href="/wiki/Imperialism" title="Imperialism">imperialism</a>&quot; who were previously considered &quot;a weak and submissive flock&quot;. With this &quot;flock&quot;, Guevara now asserted, &quot;Yankee monopoly capitalism&quot; now terrifyingly saw their &quot;gravediggers&quot;. It would be during this &quot;hour of vindication&quot;, Guevara pronounced, that the &quot;anonymous mass&quot; would begin to write its own history &quot;with its own blood&quot; and reclaim those &quot;rights that were laughed at by one and all for 500 years&quot;. Guevara closed his remarks to the General Assembly by hypothesizing that this &quot;wave of anger&quot; would &quot;sweep the lands of Latin America&quot; and that the labor masses who &quot;turn the wheel of history&quot; were now, for the first time, &quot;awakening from the long, brutalizing sleep to which they had been subjected&quot;.</p>
<p>Guevara later learned there had been two failed attempts on his life by <a href="/wiki/Cuban_exiles" class="mw-redirect" title="Cuban exiles">Cuban exiles</a> during his stop at the UN complex. The first from Molly Gonzales, who tried to break through barricades upon his arrival with a seven-inch hunting knife, and later during his address by Guillermo Novo, who fired a timer-initiated bazooka from a boat in the <a href="/wiki/East_River" title="East River">East River</a> at the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Headquarters" class="mw-redirect" title="United Nations Headquarters">United Nations Headquarters</a>, but missed and was off target. Afterwards Guevara commented on both incidents, stating that &quot;it is better to be killed by a woman with a knife than by a man with a gun&quot;, while adding with a languid wave of his cigar that the explosion had &quot;given the whole thing more flavor&quot;.</p>
<p>While in New York, Guevara appeared on the <a href="/wiki/CBS" title="CBS">CBS</a> Sunday news program <i><a href="/wiki/Face_the_Nation" title="Face the Nation">Face the Nation</a>,</i> and met with a wide range of people, from United States Senator <a href="/wiki/Eugene_McCarthy" title="Eugene McCarthy">Eugene McCarthy</a> to associates of <a href="/wiki/Malcolm_X" title="Malcolm X">Malcolm X</a>. The latter expressed his admiration, declaring Guevara &quot;one of the most revolutionary men in this country right now&quot; while reading a statement from him to a crowd at the <a href="/wiki/Audubon_Ballroom" title="Audubon Ballroom">Audubon Ballroom</a>.</p>

<p>On December 17, Guevara left New York for Paris, France, and from there embarked on a three-month world tour that included visits to the People&apos;s Republic of China, North Korea, the <a href="/wiki/United_Arab_Republic" title="United Arab Republic">United Arab Republic</a>, Algeria, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Dahomey, Congo-Brazzaville and Tanzania, with stops in Ireland and <a href="/wiki/Prague" title="Prague">Prague</a>. While in Ireland, Guevara embraced his own Irish heritage, celebrating <a href="/wiki/Saint_Patrick%27s_Day" title="Saint Patrick&apos;s Day">Saint Patrick&apos;s Day</a> in <a href="/wiki/Limerick" title="Limerick">Limerick</a> city. He wrote to his father on this visit, humorously stating &quot;I am in this green Ireland of your ancestors. When they found out, the television [station] came to ask me about the Lynch genealogy, but in case they were horse thieves or something like that, I didn&apos;t say much.&quot;</p>
<p>During this voyage, he wrote a letter to Carlos Quijano, editor of a Uruguayan weekly, which was later retitled <i>Socialism and Man in Cuba</i>. Outlined in the treatise was Guevara&apos;s summons for the creation of a new consciousness, a new status of work, and a new role of the individual. He also laid out the reasoning behind his <a href="/wiki/Anti-capitalist" class="mw-redirect" title="Anti-capitalist">anti-capitalist</a> sentiments, stating:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>The laws of capitalism, blind and invisible to the majority, act upon the individual without his thinking about it. He sees only the vastness of a seemingly infinite horizon before him. That is how it is painted by capitalist propagandists, who purport to draw a lesson from the example of <a href="/wiki/John_D._Rockefeller" title="John D. Rockefeller">Rockefeller</a>&#x2014;whether or not it is true&#x2014;about the possibilities of success. The amount of poverty and suffering required for the emergence of <a href="/wiki/Rockefeller_family" title="Rockefeller family">a Rockefeller</a>, and the amount of depravity that the accumulation of a fortune of such magnitude entails, are left out of the picture, and it is not always possible to make the people in general see this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guevara ended the essay by declaring that &quot;the true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love&quot; and beckoning on all revolutionaries to &quot;strive every day so that this love of living humanity will be transformed into acts that serve as examples&quot;, thus becoming &quot;a moving force&quot;. The genesis for Guevara&apos;s assertions relied on the fact that he believed the example of the Cuban Revolution was &quot;something spiritual that would transcend all borders&quot;.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Algiers.2C_the_Soviets.2C_and_China">Algiers, the Soviets, and China</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Algiers" title="Algiers">Algiers</a>, Algeria, on February 24, 1965, Guevara made what turned out to be his last public appearance on the international stage when he delivered a speech at an economic seminar on Afro-Asian solidarity. He specified the moral duty of the socialist countries, accusing them of tacit complicity with the exploiting Western countries. He proceeded to outline a number of measures which he said the communist-bloc countries must implement in order to accomplish the defeat of <a href="/wiki/Imperialism" title="Imperialism">imperialism</a>. Having criticized the Soviet Union (the primary financial backer of Cuba) in such a public manner, he returned to Cuba on March 14 to a solemn reception by Fidel and Ra&#xFA;l Castro, Osvaldo Dortic&#xF3;s and Carlos Rafael Rodr&#xED;guez at the Havana airport.</p>
<p>As revealed in his last public speech in Algiers, Guevara had come to view the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere" title="Northern Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>, led by the U.S. in the West and the Soviet Union in the East, as the exploiter of the <a href="/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere" title="Southern Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a>. He strongly supported Communist <a href="/wiki/North_Vietnam" title="North Vietnam">North Vietnam</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>, and urged the peoples of other developing countries to take up arms and create &quot;many Vietnams&quot;. Che&apos;s denunciations of the Soviets made him popular among intellectuals and artists of the Western European left who had lost faith in the Soviet Union, while his condemnation of imperialism and call to revolution inspired young radical students in the United States, who were impatient for societal change.</p>
<p>Moreover, the coincidence of Guevara&apos;s views with those expounded by the Chinese Communist leadership under <a href="/wiki/Mao_Zedong" title="Mao Zedong">Mao Zedong</a> was increasingly problematic for Cuba as the nation&apos;s economy became more and more dependent on the Soviet Union. Since the early days of the Cuban revolution, Guevara had been considered by many an advocate of <a href="/wiki/Maoism" title="Maoism">Maoist</a> strategy in Latin America and the originator of a plan for the rapid industrialization of Cuba that was often compared to China&apos;s &quot;<a href="/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward" title="Great Leap Forward">Great Leap Forward</a>&quot;. Castro became weary of Guevara&apos;s opposition to Soviet conditions and recommendations: measures that Castro saw as necessary, but which Guevara described as corrupt and &quot;pre-monopolist&quot;.</p>

<p>In Guevara&apos;s private writings from this time (since released), he displays his growing criticism of the Soviet political economy, believing that the Soviets had &quot;forgotten <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Marx</a>&quot;. This led Guevara to denounce a range of Soviet practices including what he saw as their attempt to &quot;air-brush the inherent violence of <a href="/wiki/Class_struggle" class="mw-redirect" title="Class struggle">class struggle</a> integral to <a href="/wiki/Communization" title="Communization">the transition</a> from capitalism to <a href="/wiki/Socialism_(Marxism)" class="mw-redirect" title="Socialism (Marxism)">socialism</a>&quot;, their &quot;dangerous&quot; policy of <a href="/wiki/Peaceful_co-existence" class="mw-redirect" title="Peaceful co-existence">peaceful co-existence</a> with the United States, their failure to push for a &quot;change in consciousness&quot; towards the idea of work, and their attempt to &quot;<a href="/wiki/Liberalization" title="Liberalization">liberalize</a>&quot; the socialist economy. Guevara wanted the complete elimination of money, <a href="/wiki/Interest" title="Interest">interest</a>, <a href="/wiki/Commodity_production" class="mw-redirect" title="Commodity production">commodity production</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Market_economy" title="Market economy">market economy</a>, and &quot;<a href="/wiki/Mercantilism" title="Mercantilism">mercantile relationships</a>&quot;: all conditions that the Soviets argued would only disappear when <a href="/wiki/World_communism" title="World communism">world communism</a> was achieved. Disagreeing with this incrementalist approach, Guevara criticized the <i>Soviet Manual of Political Economy</i>, correctly predicting that if USSR would not abolish the <a href="/wiki/Law_of_value" title="Law of value">law of value</a> (as Guevara desired), it would eventually return to capitalism.</p>
<p>Two weeks after his Algiers speech and his return to Cuba, Guevara dropped out of public life and then vanished altogether. His whereabouts were a great mystery in Cuba, as he was generally regarded as second in power to Castro himself. His disappearance was variously attributed to the failure of the Cuban industrialization scheme he had advocated while minister of industries, to pressure exerted on Castro by Soviet officials disapproving of Guevara&apos;s pro-<a href="/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China" title="Communist Party of China">Chinese Communist</a> stance on the <a href="/wiki/Sino-Soviet_split" title="Sino-Soviet split">Sino-Soviet split</a>, and to serious differences between Guevara and the pragmatic Castro regarding Cuba&apos;s economic development and ideological line. Pressed by international speculation regarding Guevara&apos;s fate, Castro stated on June 16, 1965, that the people would be informed when Guevara himself wished to let them know. Still, rumors spread both inside and outside Cuba to the missing Guevara&apos;s whereabouts.</p>
<p>On October 3, 1965, Castro publicly revealed an undated letter purportedly written to him by Guevara around seven months earlier which was later titled Che Guevara&apos;s &quot;farewell letter&quot;. In the letter, Guevara reaffirmed his enduring solidarity with the Cuban Revolution but declared his intention to leave Cuba to fight for the revolutionary cause abroad. Additionally, he resigned from all his positions in the Cuban government and communist party, and renounced his honorary Cuban citizenship.</p>

<p>In early 1965, Guevara went to Africa to offer his knowledge and experience as a guerrilla to the ongoing <a href="/wiki/Simba_Rebellion" title="Simba Rebellion">conflict in the Congo</a>. According to Algerian President <a href="/wiki/Ahmed_Ben_Bella" title="Ahmed Ben Bella">Ahmed Ben Bella</a>, Guevara thought that Africa was imperialism&apos;s weak link and so had enormous revolutionary potential. Egyptian President <a href="/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser" title="Gamal Abdel Nasser">Gamal Abdel Nasser</a>, who had fraternal relations with Che since his 1959 visit, saw Guevara&apos;s plan to fight in Congo as &quot;unwise&quot; and warned that he would become a &quot;<a href="/wiki/Tarzan" title="Tarzan">Tarzan</a>&quot; figure, doomed to failure. Despite the warning, Guevara traveled to Congo using the alias Ram&#xF3;n Ben&#xED;tez. He led the Cuban operation in support of the Marxist Simba movement, which had emerged from the ongoing Congo crisis. Guevara, his second-in-command <a href="/wiki/Victor_Dreke" class="mw-redirect" title="Victor Dreke">Victor Dreke</a>, and 12 other Cuban expeditionaries arrived in Congo on April 24, 1965 and a contingent of approximately 100 <a href="/wiki/Afro-Cuban" title="Afro-Cuban">Afro-Cubans</a> joined them soon afterward. For a time, they collaborated with guerrilla leader <a href="/wiki/Laurent-D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9_Kabila" title="Laurent-D&#xE9;sir&#xE9; Kabila">Laurent-D&#xE9;sir&#xE9; Kabila</a>, who had helped supporters of the overthrown president <a href="/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba" title="Patrice Lumumba">Patrice Lumumba</a> to lead an unsuccessful revolt months earlier. As an admirer of the late Lumumba, Guevara declared that his &quot;murder should be a lesson for all of us&quot;. Guevara, with limited knowledge of <a href="/wiki/Swahili_language" title="Swahili language">Swahili</a> and the local languages, was assigned a teenage interpreter, Freddy Ilanga. Over the course of seven months, Ilanga grew to &quot;admire the hard-working Guevara&quot;, who &quot;showed the same respect to black people as he did to whites&quot;. However, Guevara soon became disillusioned with the poor discipline of Kabila&apos;s troops and later dismissed him, stating &quot;nothing leads me to believe he is the man of the hour&quot;.</p>
<p>As an additional obstacle, white South African mercenaries, led by <a href="/wiki/Mike_Hoare" title="Mike Hoare">Mike Hoare</a> in league with Cuban exiles and the CIA, worked with the <a href="/wiki/Force_Publique" title="Force Publique">Congo National Army</a> to thwart Guevara&apos;s movements from his base camp in the mountains near the village of <a href="/wiki/Fizi" class="mw-redirect" title="Fizi">Fizi</a> on <a href="/wiki/Lake_Tanganyika" title="Lake Tanganyika">Lake Tanganyika</a> in southeast Congo. They were able to monitor his communications and so pre-empted his attacks and interdicted his supply lines. Although Guevara tried to conceal his presence in Congo, the United States government knew his location and activities. The <a href="/wiki/National_Security_Agency" title="National Security Agency">National Security Agency</a> was intercepting all of his incoming and outgoing transmissions via equipment aboard the <a href="/wiki/USNS_Private_Jose_F._Valdez_(T-AG-169)" title="USNS Private Jose F.

<p>Guevara&apos;s aim was to <a href="/wiki/Export_the_revolution" class="mw-redirect" title="Export the revolution">export the revolution</a> by instructing local anti-<a href="/wiki/Mobutu_Sese_Seko" title="Mobutu Sese Seko">Mobutu</a> Simba fighters in <a href="/wiki/Marxist" class="mw-redirect" title="Marxist">Marxist</a> ideology and <a href="/wiki/Foco_theory" class="mw-redirect" title="Foco theory">foco theory</a> strategies of <a href="/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare" title="Guerrilla warfare">guerrilla warfare</a>. In his <i>Congo Diary</i> book, he cites the incompetence, intransigence and infighting among the Congolese rebels as key reasons for the revolt&apos;s failure. Later that year on November 20, 1965, suffering from <a href="/wiki/Dysentery" title="Dysentery">dysentery</a> and acute asthma, and disheartened after seven months of frustration and inactivity, Guevara left Congo with the six Cuban survivors of his 12-man column. Guevara had planned to send the wounded back to Cuba and fight in Congo alone until his death, as a revolutionary example. But after being urged by his comrades, and two emissaries sent by Castro, at the last moment he reluctantly agreed to leave Africa. During that day and night, Guevara&apos;s forces quietly took down their base camp, burned their huts, and destroyed or threw weapons into Lake Tanganyika that they could not take with them, before crossing the border into Tanzania at night and traveling by land to Dar es Salaam. In speaking about his experience in Congo months later, Guevara concluded that he left rather than fight to the death because: &quot;The human element failed. There is no will to fight. The leaders are corrupt. In a word&#xA0;... there was nothing to do.&quot; Guevara also declared that &quot;we can&apos;t liberate by ourselves a country that does not want to fight.&quot; A few weeks later, he wrote the preface to the diary he kept during the Congo venture, that began: &quot;This is the history of a failure.&quot;</p>
<p>Guevara was reluctant to return to Cuba, because Castro had made public Guevara&apos;s &quot;farewell letter&quot;&#x2014;a letter intended to only be revealed in the case of his death&#x2014;wherein he severed all ties in order to devote himself to revolution throughout the world. As a result, Guevara spent the next six months living clandestinely in <a href="/wiki/Dar_es_Salaam" title="Dar es Salaam">Dar es Salaam</a> and <a href="/wiki/Prague" title="Prague">Prague</a>. During this time, he compiled his memoirs of the Congo experience and wrote drafts of two more books, one on philosophy and the other on economics. As Guevara prepared for Bolivia, he secretly traveled back to Cuba to visit Castro, as well as to see his wife and to write a last letter to his five children to be read upon his death, which ended with him instructing them:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>Above all, always be capable of feeling deeply any injustice committed against anyone, anywhere in the world. This is the most beautiful quality in a revolutionary.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Bolivia">Bolivia</span></h2>

<p>In late 1966, Guevara&apos;s location was still not public knowledge, although representatives of Mozambique&apos;s independence movement, the <a href="/wiki/FRELIMO" title="FRELIMO">FRELIMO</a>, reported that they met with Guevara in late 1966 in Dar es Salaam regarding his offer to aid in their revolutionary project, an offer which they ultimately rejected. In a speech at the 1967 <a href="/wiki/International_Workers%27_Day" title="International Workers&apos; Day">International Workers&apos; Day</a> rally in Havana, the acting minister of the armed forces, Major <a href="/wiki/Juan_Almeida" class="mw-redirect" title="Juan Almeida">Juan Almeida</a>, announced that Guevara was &quot;serving the revolution somewhere in Latin America&quot;.</p>
<p>Before he departed for Bolivia, Guevara altered his appearance by shaving off his beard and much of his hair, also dying it grey so he would be unrecognizable as Che Guevara. On November 3, 1966, Guevara secretly arrived in <a href="/wiki/La_Paz,_Bolivia" class="mw-redirect" title="La Paz, Bolivia">La Paz</a> on a flight from Montevideo under the false name Adolfo Mena Gonz&#xE1;lez, posing as a middle-aged Uruguayan businessman working for the <a href="/wiki/Organization_of_American_States" title="Organization of American States">Organization of American States</a>.</p>

Guevara in rural Bolivia, shortly before his death (1967).</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Three days after his arrival in Bolivia, Guevara left La Paz for the rural south east region of the country to form his guerrilla army. Guevara&apos;s first base camp was located in the <a href="/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_dry_broadleaf_forests" title="Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests">montane dry forest</a> in the remote &#xD1;ancahuaz&#xFA; region. Training at the camp in the &#xD1;ancahuaz&#xFA; valley proved to be hazardous, and little was accomplished in way of building a guerrilla army. The <a href="/wiki/Argentine" class="mw-redirect" title="Argentine">Argentine</a>-born <a href="/wiki/East_German" class="mw-redirect" title="East German">East German</a> operative <a href="/wiki/Tamara_Bunke" title="Tamara Bunke">Hayd&#xE9;e Tamara Bunke Bider</a>, better known by her <i><a href="/wiki/Nom_de_guerre" class="mw-redirect" title="Nom de guerre">nom de guerre</a></i> &quot;Tania&quot;, had been installed as Che&apos;s primary agent in <a href="/wiki/La_Paz" title="La Paz">La Paz</a>.</p>
<p>Guevara&apos;s guerrilla force, numbering about 50 men and operating as the ELN (<i>Ej&#xE9;rcito de Liberaci&#xF3;n Nacional de Bolivia</i>; &quot;<a href="/wiki/National_Liberation_Army_of_Bolivia" class="mw-redirect" title="National Liberation Army of Bolivia">National Liberation Army of Bolivia</a>&quot;), was well equipped and scored a number of early successes against Bolivian army regulars in the difficult terrain of the mountainous <a href="/wiki/Camiri" title="Camiri">Camiri</a> region during the early months of 1967. As a result of Guevara&apos;s units&apos; winning several skirmishes against Bolivian troops in the spring and summer of 1967, the Bolivian government began to overestimate the true size of the guerrilla force. But in August 1967, the Bolivian Army managed to eliminate two guerrilla groups in a violent battle, reportedly killing one of the leaders.</p>
<p>Researchers hypothesize that Guevara&apos;s plan for fomenting a revolution in Bolivia failed for an array of reasons:</p>

<p>In addition, Guevara&apos;s known preference for confrontation rather than compromise, which had previously surfaced during his guerrilla warfare campaign in Cuba, contributed to his inability to develop successful working relationships with local rebel leaders in Bolivia, just as it had in the Congo. This tendency had existed in Cuba, but had been kept in check by the timely interventions and guidance of Fidel Castro.</p>
<p>The end result was that Guevara was unable to attract inhabitants of the local area to join his militia during the eleven months he attempted recruitment. Many of the inhabitants willingly informed the Bolivian authorities and military about the guerrillas and their movements in the area. Near the end of the Bolivian venture, Guevara wrote in his diary that &quot;the peasants do not give us any help, and they are turning into informers.&quot;</p>

In addition, the 2007 documentary <i>My Enemy&apos;s Enemy</i> alleges that <a href="/wiki/Nazi" class="mw-redirect" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> war criminal <a href="/wiki/Klaus_Barbie#Che_Guevara" title="Klaus Barbie">Klaus Barbie</a> advised and possibly helped the CIA orchestrate Guevara&apos;s eventual capture.</p>
<p>On October 7, 1967, an informant apprised the Bolivian Special Forces of the location of Guevara&apos;s guerrilla encampment in the Yuro ravine. On the morning of October 8, they encircled the area with two battalions numbering 1,800 soldiers and advanced into the ravine triggering a battle where Guevara was wounded and taken prisoner while leading a detachment with <a href="/wiki/Sime%C3%B3n_Cuba_Sarabia" class="mw-redirect" title="Sime&#xF3;n Cuba Sarabia">Sime&#xF3;n Cuba Sarabia</a>. Che biographer <a href="/wiki/Jon_Lee_Anderson" title="Jon Lee Anderson">Jon Lee Anderson</a> reports Bolivian Sergeant Bernardino Huanca&apos;s account: that as the Bolivian Rangers approached, a twice-wounded Guevara, his gun rendered useless, threw up his arms in surrender and shouted to the soldiers: &quot;Do not shoot! I am Che Guevara and I am worth more to you alive than dead.&quot;</p>
<p>Guevara was tied up and taken to a dilapidated mud schoolhouse in the nearby village of <a href="/wiki/La_Higuera" title="La Higuera">La Higuera</a> on the evening of October 8. For the next half day, Guevara refused to be interrogated by Bolivian officers and would only speak quietly to Bolivian soldiers. One of those Bolivian soldiers, a helicopter pilot named Jaime Nino de Guzman, describes Che as looking &quot;dreadful&quot;. According to Guzman, Guevara was shot through the right calf, his hair was matted with dirt, his clothes were shredded, and his feet were covered in rough leather sheaths. Despite his haggard appearance, he recounts that &quot;Che held his head high, looked everyone straight in the eyes and asked only for something to smoke.&quot; De Guzman states that he &quot;took pity&quot; and gave him a small bag of tobacco for his pipe, and that Guevara then smiled and thanked him. Later on the night of October 8, Guevara&#x2014;despite having his hands tied&#x2014;kicked a Bolivian army officer, named Captain Espinosa, against a wall after the officer entered the schoolhouse and tried to snatch Guevara&apos;s pipe from his mouth as a souvenir while he was still smoking it. In another instance of defiance, Guevara spat in the face of Bolivian Rear Admiral Ugarteche, who attempted to question Guevara a few hours before his execution.</p>
<p>The following morning on October 9, Guevara asked to see the school teacher of the village, a 22-year-old woman named Julia Cortez. Cortez would later state that she found Guevara to be an &quot;agreeable looking man with a soft and ironic glance&quot; and that during their conversation she found herself &quot;unable to look him in the eye&quot; because his &quot;gaze was unbearable, piercing, and so tranquil&quot;. During their short conversation, Guevara pointed out to Cortez the poor condition of the schoolhouse, stating that it was &quot;anti-<a href="/wiki/Pedagogy" title="Pedagogy">pedagogical</a>&quot; to expect campesino students to be educated there, while &quot;government officials drive <a href="/wiki/Mercedes_(car)" class="mw-redirect" title="Mercedes (car)">Mercedes</a> cars&quot;, and declaring &quot;that&apos;s what we are fighting against.&quot;</p>
<p>Later that morning on October 9, Bolivian President <a href="/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Barrientos" title="Ren&#xE9; Barrientos">Ren&#xE9; Barrientos</a> ordered that Guevara be killed. The order was relayed to the unit holding Guevara by F&#xE9;lix Rodr&#xED;guez despite the United States government&apos;s desire that Guevara be taken to Panama for further interrogation. The executioner who volunteered to kill Guevara was <a href="/wiki/Mario_Ter%C3%A1n" title="Mario Ter&#xE1;n">Mario Ter&#xE1;n</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Alcoholic" class="mw-redirect" title="Alcoholic">alcoholic</a> 31-year-old sergeant in the Bolivian army who had personally requested to shoot Guevara because three of his friends from B Company, all with the same first name of &quot;Mario&quot;, had been killed in an earlier firefight with Guevara&apos;s band of guerrillas. To make the bullet wounds appear consistent with the story that the Bolivian government planned to release to the public, F&#xE9;lix Rodr&#xED;guez ordered Ter&#xE1;n not to shoot Guevara in the head, but to aim carefully to make it appear that Guevara had been killed in action during a clash with the Bolivian army. Gary Prado, the Bolivian captain in command of the army company that captured Guevara, said that the reasons Barrientos ordered the immediate execution of Guevara were so there would be no possibility for Guevara to escape from prison, and also so there would be no drama in regard to a public trial where adverse publicity might happen.</p>
<p>About 30 minutes before Guevara was killed, F&#xE9;lix Rodr&#xED;guez attempted to question him about the whereabouts of other guerrilla fighters who were currently at large, but Guevara continued to remain silent. Rodr&#xED;guez, assisted by a few Bolivian soldiers, helped Guevara to his feet and took him outside the hut to parade him before other Bolivian soldiers where he posed with Guevara for a <a href="/wiki/Photo_opportunity" class="mw-redirect" title="Photo opportunity">photo opportunity</a> where one soldier took a photograph of Rodr&#xED;guez and other soldiers standing alongside Guevara. A little later, Guevara was asked by one of the Bolivian soldiers guarding him if he was thinking about his own immortality. &quot;No,&quot; he replied, &quot;I&apos;m thinking about the immortality of the revolution.&quot; A few minutes later, Sergeant Ter&#xE1;n entered the hut to shoot him, whereupon Guevara reportedly said: &quot;I know you&apos;ve come to kill me. Shoot, coward, you are only going to kill a man.&quot; Ter&#xE1;n hesitated, then pointed his self-loading <a href="/wiki/M1_Carbine" class="mw-redirect" title="M1 Carbine">M2 Carbine</a> at Guevara and opened fire, hitting him in the arms and legs. Then, as Guevara writhed on the ground, apparently biting one of his wrists to avoid crying out, Ter&#xE1;n fired another burst, fatally wounding him in the chest. Guevara was pronounced dead at 1:10 pm local time according to Rodr&#xED;guez. In all, Guevara was shot nine times by Ter&#xE1;n. This included five times in his legs, once in the right shoulder and arm, and once in the chest and throat.</p>
<p>Months earlier, during his last public declaration to the <a href="/wiki/Tricontinental_Conference" class="mw-redirect" title="Tricontinental Conference">Tricontinental Conference</a>, Guevara wrote his own <a href="/wiki/Epitaph" title="Epitaph">epitaph</a>, stating &quot;Wherever death may surprise us, let it be welcome, provided that this our battle cry may have reached some receptive ear and another hand may be extended to wield our weapons.&quot;</p>

<p>After his execution, Guevara&apos;s body was lashed to the landing skids of a helicopter and flown to nearby <a href="/wiki/Vallegrande" title="Vallegrande">Vallegrande</a>, where photographs were taken of him lying on a concrete slab in the laundry room of the Nuestra Se&#xF1;ora de Malta.

Such comparisons were further extended when English art critic <a href="/wiki/John_Berger" title="John Berger">John Berger</a>, two weeks later upon seeing the post-mortem photographs, observed that they resembled two famous paintings: <a href="/wiki/Rembrandt" title="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a>&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Anatomy_Lesson_of_Dr._Nicolaes_Tulp" title="The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp">The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp</a></i> and <a href="/wiki/Andrea_Mantegna" title="Andrea Mantegna">Andrea Mantegna</a>&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/Lamentation_over_the_Dead_Christ_(Mantegna)" class="mw-redirect" title="Lamentation over the Dead Christ (Mantegna)">Lamentation over the Dead Christ</a></i>. There were also four correspondents present when Guevara&apos;s body arrived in Vallegrande, including <a href="/wiki/Bj%C3%B6rn_Kumm" title="Bj&#xF6;rn Kumm">Bj&#xF6;rn Kumm</a> of the Swedish <i><a href="/wiki/Aftonbladet" title="Aftonbladet">Aftonbladet</a></i>, who described the scene in a November 11, 1967 exclusive for <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_Republic" title="The New Republic">The New Republic</a></i>.</p>

After a military doctor amputated his hands, Bolivian army officers transferred Guevara&apos;s body to an undisclosed location and refused to reveal whether his remains had been buried or cremated. The hands were preserved in <a href="/wiki/Formaldehyde" title="Formaldehyde">formaldehyde</a> to be sent to Buenos Aires for fingerprint identification. (His fingerprints were on file with the Argentine police.) They were later sent to Cuba.</p>

<p>On October 15 <a href="/wiki/Fidel_Castro" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a> publicly acknowledged that Guevara was dead and proclaimed three days of public mourning throughout Cuba.

<p>Also removed when Guevara was captured were his 30,000-word, hand-written diary, a collection of his personal poetry, and a short story he had authored about a young Communist guerrilla who learns to overcome his fears. His diary documented events of the guerrilla campaign in Bolivia, with the first entry on November 7, 1966, shortly after his arrival at the farm in &#xD1;ancahuaz&#xFA;, and the last dated October 7, 1967, the day before his capture. The diary tells how the guerrillas were forced to begin operations prematurely because of discovery by the Bolivian Army, explains Guevara&apos;s decision to divide the column into two units that were subsequently unable to re-establish contact, and describes their overall unsuccessful venture. It also records the rift between Guevara and the Communist Party of Bolivia that resulted in Guevara having significantly fewer soldiers than originally expected, and shows that Guevara had a great deal of difficulty recruiting from the local populace, partly because the guerrilla group had learned <a href="/wiki/Quechua_languages" class="mw-redirect" title="Quechua languages">Quechua</a>, unaware that the local language was actually a <a href="/wiki/Tup%C3%AD%E2%80%93Guaran%C3%AD" class="mw-redirect" title="Tup&#xED;&#x2013;Guaran&#xED;">Tup&#xED;&#x2013;Guaran&#xED;</a> language. As the campaign drew to an unexpected close, Guevara became increasingly ill. He suffered from ever-worsening bouts of asthma, and most of his last offensives were carried out in an attempt to obtain medicine. The Bolivian diary was quickly and crudely translated by <i><a href="/wiki/Ramparts_(magazine)" title="Ramparts (magazine)">Ramparts</a></i> magazine and circulated around the world. There are at least four additional diaries in existence&#x2014;those of Israel Reyes Zayas (Alias &quot;Braulio&quot;), Harry Villegas Tamayo (<a href="/wiki/Harry_%22Pombo%22_Villegas" title="Harry &quot;Pombo&quot; Villegas">&quot;Pombo&quot;</a>), Eliseo Reyes Rodriguez (&quot;Rolando&quot;) and Dariel Alarc&#xF3;n Ram&#xED;rez (&quot;Benigno&quot;)&#x2014;each of which reveals additional aspects of the events.</p>
<p>French <a href="/wiki/Intellectual" title="Intellectual">intellectual</a> <a href="/wiki/R%C3%A9gis_Debray" title="R&#xE9;gis Debray">R&#xE9;gis Debray</a>, who was captured in April 1967 while with Guevara in Bolivia, gave an interview from prison in August 1968, in which he enlarged on the circumstances of Guevara&apos;s capture. Debray, who had lived with Guevara&apos;s band of guerrillas for a short time, said that in his view they were &quot;victims of the forest&quot; and thus &quot;eaten by the jungle&quot;. Debray described a destitute situation where Guevara&apos;s men suffered malnutrition, lack of water, absence of shoes, and only possessed six blankets for 22 men. Debray recounts that Guevara and the others had been suffering an &quot;illness&quot; which caused their hands and feet to swell into &quot;mounds of flesh&quot; to the point where you could not discern the fingers on their hands. Debray described Guevara as &quot;optimistic about the future of Latin America&quot; despite the futile situation, and remarked that Guevara was &quot;resigned to die in the knowledge that his death would be a sort of renaissance&quot;, noting that Guevara perceived death &quot;as a promise of rebirth&quot; and &quot;ritual of renewal&quot;.</p>
<p>To a certain extent, this belief by Guevara of a metaphorical resurrection came true. While pictures of the dead Guevara were being circulated and the circumstances of his death were being debated, Che&apos;s legend began to spread. Demonstrations in protest against his &quot;assassination&quot; occurred throughout the world, and articles, tributes, and poems were written about his life and death. Rallies in support of Guevara were held from &quot;Mexico to <a href="/wiki/Santiago,_Chile" class="mw-redirect" title="Santiago, Chile">Santiago</a>, <a href="/wiki/Algiers,_Algeria" class="mw-redirect" title="Algiers, Algeria">Algiers</a> to Angola, and <a href="/wiki/Cairo,_Egypt" class="mw-redirect" title="Cairo, Egypt">Cairo</a> to <a href="/wiki/Calcutta,_India" class="mw-redirect" title="Calcutta, India">Calcutta</a>.&quot; The population of <a href="/wiki/Budapest,_Hungary" class="mw-redirect" title="Budapest, Hungary">Budapest</a> and <a href="/wiki/Prague,_Czech_Republic" class="mw-redirect" title="Prague, Czech Republic">Prague</a> lit candles to honor Guevara&apos;s passing; and the picture of a smiling Che appeared in London and Paris. When a few months later riots broke out in <a href="/wiki/Berlin,_Germany" class="mw-redirect" title="Berlin, Germany">Berlin</a>, <a href="/wiki/May_1968_protests_in_France" class="mw-redirect" title="May 1968 protests in France">France</a>, and <a href="/wiki/1968_Democratic_National_Convention_protest_activity" title="1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity">Chicago</a>, and the unrest spread to the American college campuses, young men and women wore Che Guevara T-shirts and carried his pictures during their protest marches. In the view of military historian <a href="/wiki/Erik_Durschmied" title="Erik Durschmied">Erik Durschmied</a>: <i>&quot;In those <a href="/wiki/Protests_of_1968" title="Protests of 1968">heady months of 1968</a>, Che Guevara was not dead.

<p>In late 1995, the retired <a href="/wiki/Bolivia" title="Bolivia">Bolivian</a> General Mario Vargas revealed to <a href="/wiki/Jon_Lee_Anderson" title="Jon Lee Anderson">Jon Lee Anderson</a>, author of <i>Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life</i>, that Guevara&apos;s corpse lay near a <a href="/wiki/Vallegrande" title="Vallegrande">Vallegrande</a> airstrip. The result was a multi-national search for the remains, which would last more than a year. In July 1997 a team of Cuban geologists and Argentine <a href="/wiki/Forensic_anthropology" title="Forensic anthropology">forensic anthropologists</a> discovered the remnants of seven bodies in two mass graves, including one man with amputated hands (like Guevara). Bolivian government officials with the Ministry of Interior later identified the body as Guevara when the excavated teeth &quot;perfectly matched&quot; a plaster mold of Che&apos;s teeth made in Cuba prior to his Congolese expedition. The &quot;clincher&quot; then arrived when Argentine forensic anthropologist Alejandro Inchaurregui inspected the inside hidden pocket of a blue jacket dug up next to the handless cadaver and found a small bag of pipe tobacco. Nino de Guzman, the Bolivian helicopter pilot who had given Che a small bag of tobacco, later remarked that he &quot;had serious doubts&quot; at first and &quot;thought the Cubans would just find any old bones and call it Che&quot;; but &quot;after hearing about the tobacco pouch, I have no doubts.&quot; On October 17, 1997, Guevara&apos;s remains, with those of six of his fellow combatants, were laid to rest with military honors in a specially built <a href="/wiki/Mausoleo_Che_Guevara" class="mw-redirect" title="Mausoleo Che Guevara">mausoleum</a> in the Cuban city of <a href="/wiki/Santa_Clara,_Cuba" title="Santa Clara, Cuba">Santa Clara</a>, where he had commanded over the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Santa_Clara" title="Battle of Santa Clara">decisive military victory</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Cuban_Revolution" title="Cuban Revolution">Cuban Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>In July 2008, the Bolivian government of <a href="/wiki/Evo_Morales" title="Evo Morales">Evo Morales</a> unveiled Guevara&apos;s formerly-sealed diaries composed in two frayed notebooks, along with a logbook and several black-and-white photographs. At this event Bolivia&apos;s vice-minister of culture, Pablo Groux, expressed that there were plans to publish photographs of every handwritten page later in the year. Meanwhile, in August 2009 anthropologists working for Bolivia&apos;s Justice Ministry discovered and unearthed the bodies of five of Guevara&apos;s fellow guerrillas near the Bolivian town of <a href="/wiki/Teoponte" title="Teoponte">Teoponte</a>.</p>

<p>The discovery of Che&apos;s remains metonymically activated a series of interlinked associations&#x2014;rebel, martyr, rogue figure from a picaresque adventure, savior, renegade, extremist&#x2014;in which there was no fixed divide among them. The current court of opinion places Che on a continuum that teeters between viewing him as a misguided rebel, a coruscatingly brilliant guerrilla philosopher, a poet-warrior jousting at windmills, a brazen warrior who threw down the gauntlet to the bourgeoisie, the object of fervent paeans to his sainthood, or a mass murderer clothed in the guise of an avenging angel whose every action is imbricated in violence&#x2014;the archetypal Fanatical Terrorist.</p>

<p>Guevara&apos;s life and legacy remain contentious. The perceived contradictions of his ethos at various points in his life have created a complex character of duality, one who was &quot;able to wield the pen and submachine gun with equal skill,&quot; while prophesying that &quot;the most important revolutionary ambition was to see man liberated from <a href="/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_alienation" title="Marx&apos;s theory of alienation">his alienation</a>.&quot; As undogmatic as he was committed, his vision of liberation was at once romantic, poetic, compassionate, and ruthless. Guevara&apos;s paradoxical standing is further complicated by his array of seemingly diametrically opposed qualities. A <a href="/wiki/Secular_humanism" title="Secular humanism">secular humanist</a> and sympathetic practitioner of medicine who did not hesitate to shoot his enemies, a celebrated <a href="/wiki/Proletarian_internationalism" title="Proletarian internationalism">internationalist</a> leader who advocated violence to enforce a <a href="/wiki/Utopia" title="Utopia">utopian</a> philosophy of the <a href="/wiki/Public_good" title="Public good">collective good</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Idealism" title="Idealism">idealistic</a> <a href="/wiki/Intellectual" title="Intellectual">intellectual</a> who loved literature but refused to allow dissent, an <a href="/wiki/Anti-imperialism" title="Anti-imperialism">anti-imperialist</a> <a href="/wiki/Marxism" title="Marxism">Marxist</a> <a href="/wiki/Insurgency" title="Insurgency">insurgent</a> who was radically willing to forge a poverty-less new world on the apocalyptic ashes of the old one, and finally, an outspoken <a href="/wiki/Anti-capitalism" title="Anti-capitalism">anti-capitalist</a> whose image has been expropriated and <a href="/wiki/Commodification" title="Commodification">commoditized</a>; Che&apos;s history continues to be rewritten and re-imagined. <a href="/wiki/Sociology" title="Sociology">Sociologist</a> <a href="/wiki/Michael_L%C3%B6wy" title="Michael L&#xF6;wy">Michael L&#xF6;wy</a> contends that the many facets of Guevara&apos;s life (i.e. doctor and economist, revolutionary and banker, military theoretician and ambassador, deep thinker and political agitator) illuminated the rise of the &quot;Che myth&quot;, allowing him to be invariably crystallized in his many <a href="/wiki/Metanarrative" title="Metanarrative">metanarrative</a> roles as a &quot;Red <a href="/wiki/Robin_Hood" title="Robin Hood">Robin Hood</a>, <a href="/wiki/Don_Quixote" title="Don Quixote">Don Quixote</a> of communism, new <a href="/wiki/Giuseppe_Garibaldi" title="Giuseppe Garibaldi">Garibaldi</a>, Marxist <a href="/wiki/Louis_Antoine_de_Saint-Just" title="Louis Antoine de Saint-Just">Saint Just</a>, <a href="/wiki/El_Cid" title="El Cid">Cid Campeador</a> of <a href="/wiki/The_Wretched_of_the_Earth" title="The Wretched of the Earth">the Wretched of the Earth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Galahad" title="Galahad">Sir Galahad</a> of the beggars&#xA0;... and <a href="/wiki/Bolshevik" class="mw-redirect" title="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> devil who haunts the dreams of the rich, (while) kindling <a href="/wiki/Brazier" title="Brazier">braziers</a> of subversion all over the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Various notable individuals have lauded Guevara as a hero; for example, <a href="/wiki/Nelson_Mandela" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> referred to him as &quot;an inspiration for every human being who loves freedom&quot;, while <a href="/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre" title="Jean-Paul Sartre">Jean-Paul Sartre</a> described him as &quot;not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age&quot;. Others who have expressed their admiration include authors <a href="/wiki/Graham_Greene" title="Graham Greene">Graham Greene</a>, who remarked that Guevara &quot;represented the idea of gallantry, chivalry, and adventure&quot;, and <a href="/wiki/Susan_Sontag" title="Susan Sontag">Susan Sontag</a>, who supposed that &quot;[Che&apos;s] goal was nothing less than the cause of humanity itself.&quot; In the black community, philosopher <a href="/wiki/Frantz_Fanon" title="Frantz Fanon">Frantz Fanon</a> professed Guevara to be &quot;the world symbol of the possibilities of one man&quot;, while <a href="/wiki/Black_Power" title="Black Power">Black Power</a> leader <a href="/wiki/Stokely_Carmichael" title="Stokely Carmichael">Stokely Carmichael</a> eulogized that &quot;Che Guevara is not dead, his ideas are with us.&quot; Praise has been reflected throughout the political spectrum, with the <a href="/wiki/Libertarianism" title="Libertarianism">libertarian</a> theorist <a href="/wiki/Murray_Rothbard" title="Murray Rothbard">Murray Rothbard</a> extolling Guevara as a &quot;heroic figure&quot;, lamenting after his death that &quot;more than any man of our epoch or even of our century, [Che] was the living embodiment of the principle of revolution&quot;, while journalist <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens" title="Christopher Hitchens">Christopher Hitchens</a> commented that &quot;[Che&apos;s] death meant a lot to me and countless like me at the time, he was a role model, albeit an impossible one for us <a href="/wiki/Bourgeois" class="mw-redirect" title="Bourgeois">bourgeois</a> <a href="/wiki/Romanticism" title="Romanticism">romantics</a> insofar as he went and did what revolutionaries were meant to do&#x2014;fought and died for his beliefs.&quot;  British historian <a href="/wiki/Hugh_Thomas_(writer)" class="mw-redirect" title="Hugh Thomas (writer)">Hugh Thomas</a> opines that Guevara was a &quot;brave, sincere and determined man who was also obstinate, narrow, and dogmatic.&quot; At the end of his life, according to Thomas, &quot;he seems to have become convinced of the virtues of violence for its own sake&quot;, while &quot;his influence over <a href="/wiki/Fidel_Castro" title="Fidel Castro">Castro</a> for good or evil&quot; grew after his death, as Fidel took up many of his views. In Thomas&apos; assessment, &quot;As in the case of <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mart%C3%AD" title="Jos&#xE9; Mart&#xED;">Mart&#xED;</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Lawrence_of_Arabia" class="mw-redirect" title="Lawrence of Arabia">Lawrence of Arabia</a>, failure has brightened, not dimmed the legend.&quot; Similarly, the Cuban-American sociologist <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Farber" title="Samuel Farber">Samuel Farber</a> lauds Che Guevara as &quot;an honest and committed revolutionary,&quot; but also criticizes the fact that &quot;he never embraced socialism in its most democratic essence.&quot;</p>
<p>Conversely, Jacobo Machover, an exiled opposition author, dismisses all praise of Guevara and portrays him as a callous executioner. Exiled former Cuban prisoners have expressed similar opinions, among them <a href="/wiki/Armando_Valladares" title="Armando Valladares">Armando Valladares</a>, who has declared Guevara &quot;a man full of hatred&quot; who executed dozens without trial, and <a href="/wiki/Carlos_Alberto_Montaner" title="Carlos Alberto Montaner">Carlos Alberto Montaner</a>, who has claimed that Guevara possessed &quot;a <a href="/wiki/Maximilien_de_Robespierre" class="mw-redirect" title="Maximilien de Robespierre">Robespierre</a> mentality&quot;, wherein cruelty against the revolution&apos;s enemies was a virtue. <a href="/wiki/Alvaro_Vargas_Llosa" class="mw-redirect" title="Alvaro Vargas Llosa">Alvaro Vargas Llosa</a> of <a href="/wiki/The_Independent_Institute" class="mw-redirect" title="The Independent Institute">The Independent Institute</a> has hypothesized that Guevara&apos;s contemporary followers &quot;delude themselves by clinging to a myth&quot;, describing Guevara as a &quot;Marxist <a href="/wiki/Puritan" class="mw-redirect" title="Puritan">Puritan</a>&quot; who employed his rigid power to suppress dissent, while also operating as a &quot;cold-blooded killing machine&quot;. Llosa accused Guevara&apos;s &quot;fanatical disposition&quot; as being the linchpin of the &quot;Sovietization&quot; of the Cuban revolution, speculating that he possessed a &quot;total subordination of reality to blind ideological orthodoxy&quot;. Moreover, detractors have attempted to demonstrate that Che-inspired revolutions in much of Latin America had the practical result of reinforcing brutal militarism and internecine conflict for many years. <a href="/wiki/Hoover_Institution" title="Hoover Institution">Hoover Institution</a> research fellow <a href="/wiki/William_Ratliff" title="William Ratliff">William Ratliff</a> regards Guevara as a creation of his historical environment, referring to him as a &quot;fearless&quot; and &quot;head-strong Messiah-like figure&quot;, who was the product of a <a href="/wiki/Martyr" title="Martyr">martyr</a>-enamored <a href="/wiki/Latin_American_culture" title="Latin American culture">Latin culture</a> which &quot;inclined people to seek out and follow <a href="/wiki/Paternalism" title="Paternalism">paternalistic</a> miracle workers.&quot; Ratliff has speculated that the economic conditions in the region suited Guevara&apos;s commitment to &quot;bring justice to the downtrodden by crushing centuries-old tyrannies&quot;; describing Latin America as being plagued by what <a href="/wiki/Mois%C3%A9s_Na%C3%ADm" title="Mois&#xE9;s Na&#xED;m">Mois&#xE9;s Na&#xED;m</a> referred to as the &quot;legendary malignancies&quot; of inequality, poverty, dysfunctional politics and malfunctioning institutions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Guevara remains a national hero in Cuba, where his image adorns the 3 <a href="/wiki/Cuban_peso" title="Cuban peso">peso</a> banknote and school children begin each morning by pledging &quot;We will be like Che.&quot; In his homeland of Argentina, where high schools bear his name, numerous Che museums dot the country, which in 2008 unveiled a 12-foot (3.7&#xA0;m) bronze statue of him in the city of his birth, Rosario. Additionally, Guevara has been <a href="/wiki/Sanctification" title="Sanctification">sanctified</a> by some Bolivian campesinos as &quot;<a href="/wiki/Che_Guevara_in_popular_culture#In_religion" title="Che Guevara in popular culture">Saint Ernesto</a>&quot;, who pray to him for assistance. In stark contrast, Guevara remains a hated figure amongst many in the <a href="/wiki/Cuban_exile" title="Cuban exile">Cuban exile</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cuban-American" class="mw-redirect" title="Cuban-American">Cuban-American</a> community of the United States, who view him with animosity as &quot;the butcher of <a href="/wiki/La_Caba%C3%B1a" title="La Caba&#xF1;a">La Caba&#xF1;a</a>&quot;. Despite this polarized status, a high-contrast <a href="/wiki/Monochrome" title="Monochrome">monochrome</a> graphic of <a href="/wiki/Guerrillero_Heroico" title="Guerrillero Heroico">Che&apos;s face</a>, created in 1968 by Irish artist <a href="/wiki/Jim_Fitzpatrick_(artist)" title="Jim Fitzpatrick (artist)">Jim Fitzpatrick</a>, became a universally <a href="/wiki/Merchandising" title="Merchandising">merchandized</a> and objectified image, found on an endless array of items, including T-shirts, hats, posters, tattoos, and bikinis, ironically contributing to the <a href="/wiki/Consumer_capitalism" title="Consumer capitalism">consumer culture</a> Guevara despised. Yet, he still remains a transcendent figure both in specifically political contexts and as a wide-ranging popular icon of youthful rebellion.</p>
