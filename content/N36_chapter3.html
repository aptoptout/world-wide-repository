His aunt gave him the name Orenthal, which supposedly was the name of a French actor she liked. Simpson has one brother, Melvin Leon &quot;Truman&quot; Simpson, one living sister, Shirley Simpson-Baker, and one deceased sister, Carmelita Simpson-Durio. As a child, Simpson developed <a href="/wiki/Rickets" title="Rickets">rickets</a> and wore braces on his legs until the age of five.

After he was drafted, Simpson demanded what was then the largest contract in professional sports history: $650,000 over five years. This demand led to a standoff between Simpson and Bills owner <a href="/wiki/Ralph_Wilson" title="Ralph Wilson">Ralph Wilson</a>, with Simpson threatening to become an actor and skip playing professional football. Eventually, Wilson agreed to pay Simpson.</p><p>Simpson came into professional football with high expectations. However, he struggled during his first three seasons, averaging only 622 yards per season. Bills coach <a href="/wiki/John_Rauch" title="John Rauch">John Rauch</a>, not wanting to build an offense around one running back, assigned Simpson to do blocking and receiving duties at the expense of running the ball. In 1971, Rauch resigned as head coach and the Bills brought in <a href="/wiki/Harvey_Johnson_(coach)" title="Harvey Johnson (coach)">Harvey Johnson</a>. Despite Johnson devising a new offense for Simpson, Simpson was still ineffective that year. After the 1971 season, the Bills fired Johnson and brought in <a href="/wiki/Lou_Saban" title="Lou Saban">Lou Saban</a> to coach. Unlike Rauch, Saban made Simpson the centerpiece of the Bills offense.</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/1972_Buffalo_Bills_season" title="1972 Buffalo Bills season">1972</a> with coach Saban at the helm, Simpson rushed for over 1,000 yards in the season for the first time in his career, gaining a league leading total of 1,251 yards. In <a href="/wiki/1973_Buffalo_Bills_season" title="1973 Buffalo Bills season">1973</a>, Simpson became the first player to break the highly coveted <a href="/wiki/2,000-yard_club" title="2,000-yard club">2,000 yard rushing mark</a>, with 2,003 total rushing yards and 12 touchdowns. Simpson broke the mark during the last game of the season against the <a href="/wiki/1973_New_York_Jets_season" title="1973 New York Jets season">New York Jets</a> with a 7-yard rush. That same game also saw Simpson break <a href="/wiki/Jim_Brown" title="Jim Brown">Jim Brown</a>&apos;s single season rushing record of 1,863 yards. For his performance, Simpson won that year&apos;s <a href="/wiki/National_Football_League_Most_Valuable_Player_Award" title="National Football League Most Valuable Player Award">NFL MVP Award</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bert_Bell_Award" title="Bert Bell Award">Bert Bell Award</a>. While other players had broken the 2,000-yard mark since Simpson, this record happened back when the NFL only had 14 game seasons, as opposed to the 16 game seasons of today.</p><p>Simpson gained more than 1,000 rushing yards for each of his next three seasons. Simpson did not lead the league in rushing in <a href="/wiki/1974_Buffalo_Bills_season" title="1974 Buffalo Bills season">1974</a>, but did cross the 1,000-yard barrier despite a sore knee. Simpson also made his first and only <a href="/wiki/National_Football_League_playoffs" title="National Football League playoffs">playoff</a> appearance during the 1974 season.

In that game, Simpson rushed for a then record 273 yards on 29 attempts and scored two touchdowns. Despite Simpson&apos;s performance, the Bills would lose the game 27-14.</p><p>Simpson played in only seven games in <a href="/wiki/1977_Buffalo_Bills_season" title="1977 Buffalo Bills season">1977</a>, as his season was cut short by injury.</p><p>Before the <a href="/wiki/1978_NFL_season" title="1978 NFL season">1978 season</a>, the Bills traded Simpson to the <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers" title="San Francisco 49ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> for a series of draft picks.

In 1979, he started his own film production company, Orenthal Productions, which dealt mostly in made-for-TV fare such as the family-oriented <i><a href="/wiki/Goldie_and_the_Boxer" title="Goldie and the Boxer">Goldie and the Boxer</a></i> films with <a href="/wiki/Melissa_Michaelsen" title="Melissa Michaelsen">Melissa Michaelsen</a> (1979 and 1981) and <i>Cocaine and Blue Eyes</i> (1983), the pilot for a proposed detective series on <a href="/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a>.

He also appeared in the audience of <i><a href="/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live" title="Saturday Night Live">Saturday Night Live</a></i> during its second season and hosted an episode during its third season.</p><p>Simpson starred in the un-televised two-hour-long <a href="/wiki/Film_pilot" class="mw-redirect" title="Film pilot">film pilot</a> for <i>Frogmen</i>, a <i><a href="/wiki/The_A-Team" title="The A-Team">The A-Team</a></i>-like adventure series that <a href="/wiki/Warner_Bros._Television" title="Warner Bros. Television">Warner Bros. Television</a> completed in 1994, a few months before the murders. NBC had not yet decided on whether to order the series when Simpson&apos;s arrest cancelled the project. While searching his home the police obtained a videotaped copy of the pilot as well as the script and <a href="/wiki/Dailies" title="Dailies">dailies</a>. Although the prosecution investigated reports that Simpson, who played the leader of a group of former <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy_SEALs" title="United States Navy SEALs">United States Navy SEALs</a>, received &quot;a fair amount of&quot; military training&#x2014;including use of a knife&#x2014;for <i>Frogmen</i>, and there is a scene in which he holds a knife to the throat of a woman, it was not introduced as evidence during the trial.</p><p>NBC executive <a href="/wiki/Warren_Littlefield" title="Warren Littlefield">Warren Littlefield</a> said in July 1994 that the network would probably never air the pilot if Simpson were convicted; if he were acquitted, however, one television journalist speculated that &quot;<i>Frogmen</i> would probably be on the air before the <a href="/wiki/NBC_peacock" class="mw-redirect" title="NBC peacock">NBC peacock</a> could unfurl its plume&quot;. Most pilots that are two hours long are aired as TV movies whether or not they are ordered as series.

One of Simpson&apos;s co-stars in the film commented that the studio&apos;s decision to not air it or even release it on home video, and forego an estimated $14&#xA0;million in profits, was &quot;just about the only proof you have that there is some dignity in the advertising and television business&quot;.</p><p>In 2006, Simpson starred in his own improv, hidden-camera prank TV show called &quot;Juiced&quot;. Typical of the genre, Simpson would play a prank on everyday people while secretly filming them and at the end of each prank he would shout, &quot;You&apos;ve been Juiced!&quot; Less typical, each episode opened with topless strippers dancing around Simpson who is dressed as pimp and sings his own rap song: &quot;Don&apos;t you know there&apos;s no stopping the Juice / When I&apos;m on the floor I&apos;m like a lion on the loose / Better shoot me with a tranquilizer dart / Don&apos;t be stupid, I&apos;m not a Simpson named Bart.&quot; In one episode, Simpson is at a used car lot in Las Vegas where he attempts to sell his infamous white Bronco which includes a bullet hole in the front of the SUV circled with his autograph, with this pitch: &quot;If you ever get into some trouble and have to get away, it has escapability.&quot; In another sketch called &quot;B-I-N-G-O.J.&quot;, Simpson pretends to be having an affair with another guy&apos;s girlfriend and he transforms into an old, white guy whose dying wish is to call for a Bingo game. &quot;Juiced&quot; aired as a one-time special on pay-per-view television and was later released on DVD.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Chuck_Barnes" title="Chuck Barnes">Chuck Barnes</a> helped Simpson form business relationships with <a href="/wiki/Chevrolet" title="Chevrolet">Chevrolet</a> and <a href="/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> early in his career.

The couple had two children, Sydney Brooke Simpson (born October 17, 1985) and Justin Ryan Simpson (born August 6, 1988).

In 1993, after the divorce, Brown and Simpson made an attempt at reconciliation, but according to Sheila Weller &quot;they were a dramatic, fractious, mutually obsessed couple before they married, after they married, after they divorced in 1992, and after they reconciled&quot;.</p><p>On June 12, 1994, Nicole Brown and <a href="/wiki/Ron_Goldman" title="Ron Goldman">Ron Goldman</a> were found stabbed to death outside Brown&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Condominium" title="Condominium">condominium</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Brentwood,_Los_Angeles" title="Brentwood, Los Angeles">Brentwood</a> area of Los Angeles.

The trial, often characterized as the <a href="/wiki/Trial_of_the_Century" class="mw-redirect" title="Trial of the Century">Trial of the Century</a> because of its international publicity, similar to that of <a href="/wiki/Sacco_and_Vanzetti" title="Sacco and Vanzetti">Sacco and Vanzetti</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Lindbergh_kidnapping" title="Lindbergh kidnapping">Lindbergh kidnapping</a>, culminated on October 3, 1995, in a jury verdict of &quot;not guilty&quot; for the two murders. An estimated 100 million people nationwide tuned in to watch or listen to the verdict announcement.

Superior Court Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki presided, and he barred television and still cameras, radio equipment, and courtroom sketch artists from the courtroom. On October 23, 1996, opening statements were made, and on January 16, 1997, both sides rested their cases.</p><p>On February 5, 1997, a civil jury in <a href="/wiki/Santa_Monica,_California" title="Santa Monica, California">Santa Monica, California</a> unanimously found Simpson liable for the <a href="/wiki/Wrongful_death" class="mw-redirect" title="Wrongful death">wrongful death</a> of and battery against Goldman, and battery against Brown.

District Attorney David Roger of Clark County provided District Court Judge Jackie Glass with evidence that Simpson had violated his bail terms. A hearing took place on January 16, 2008. Glass raised Simpson&apos;s bail to US$250,000 and ordered that he remain in county jail until 15 percent was paid in cash. Simpson posted bond that evening and returned to <a href="/wiki/Miami" title="Miami">Miami</a> the next day.</p><p>Simpson and his co-defendant were found guilty of all charges on October 3, 2008.
