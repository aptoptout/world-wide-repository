Becoming an MP in 2001, he served in the <a href="/wiki/Official_Opposition_Shadow_Cabinet_(United_Kingdom)" title="Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)">opposition shadow cabinet</a> under Conservative leader <a href="/wiki/Michael_Howard" title="Michael Howard">Michael Howard</a>, succeeding Howard in 2005. Cameron sought to rebrand the Conservatives, embracing an increasingly socially liberal position. The <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010" title="United Kingdom general election, 2010">2010 general election</a> led to Cameron becoming Prime Minister as the head of a <a href="/wiki/First_Cameron_ministry" title="First Cameron ministry">coalition government</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Democrats" title="Liberal Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a>. His <a href="/wiki/Premiership_of_David_Cameron" title="Premiership of David Cameron">premiership</a> was marked by the ongoing effects of the <a href="/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308" title="Financial crisis of 2007&#x2013;08">late-2000s financial crisis</a>; these involved a large deficit in government finances that his government sought to reduce through <a href="/wiki/Austerity" title="Austerity">austerity</a> measures. His administration introduced large-scale changes to <a href="/wiki/Welfare_state_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="Welfare state in the United Kingdom">welfare</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_immigration_law" title="United Kingdom immigration law">immigration policy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Education_in_England" title="Education in England">education</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Healthcare_in_England" title="Healthcare in England">healthcare</a>.

When the Conservatives secured a majority in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2015" title="United Kingdom general election, 2015">2015 general election</a>, he remained as Prime Minister leading a Conservative government. To fulfil a manifesto pledge, he introduced a <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum,_2016" title="United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016">referendum on the UK&apos;s continuing membership of the EU</a>. Cameron supported continued membership; following the success of the &quot;Leave&quot; vote, he announced that he would step down before the October 2016 Conservative Party conference to <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)_leadership_election,_2016" title="Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2016">make way for a new Prime Minister</a>.</p><p>Cameron has been praised for modernising the Conservative Party and for reining in the United Kingdom&apos;s national debt. Conversely he has been criticised by figures on both the <a href="/wiki/Left-wing_politics" title="Left-wing politics">left</a> and <a href="/wiki/Right-wing_politics" title="Right-wing politics">right</a>, accused of political opportunism and social elitism.

Due to good grades, Cameron entered its top academic class almost two years early. At the age of thirteen, he went on to <a href="/wiki/Eton_College" title="Eton College">Eton College</a> in <a href="/wiki/Berkshire" title="Berkshire">Berkshire</a>, following his father and elder brother. His early interest was in art. Six weeks before taking his <a href="/wiki/GCE_Ordinary_Level" title="GCE Ordinary Level">O-Levels</a> he was caught smoking <a href="/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)" title="Cannabis (drug)">cannabis</a>. He admitted the offence and had not been involved in selling drugs, so he was not expelled, but was fined, prevented from leaving the school grounds, and given a &quot;<a href="/wiki/Georgics" title="Georgics">Georgic</a>&quot; (a punishment which involved copying 500 lines of <a href="/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> text).</p><p>Cameron passed twelve <a href="/wiki/GCE_Ordinary_Level" title="GCE Ordinary Level">O-Levels</a> and then three <a href="/wiki/A-level" class="mw-redirect" title="A-level">A-levels</a>: <a href="/wiki/History_of_art" title="History of art">History of art</a>, History, in which he was taught by <a href="/wiki/Michael_Kidson" title="Michael Kidson">Michael Kidson</a>, and Economics with Politics. He obtained three &apos;A&apos; grades and a &apos;1&apos; grade in the <a href="/wiki/Scholarship_Level" title="Scholarship Level">Scholarship Level</a> exam in Economics and Politics. The following autumn he passed the entrance exam for the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oxford" title="University of Oxford">University of Oxford</a>, and was offered an <a href="/wiki/Exhibition_(scholarship)" title="Exhibition (scholarship)">exhibition</a> at <a href="/wiki/Brasenose_College,_Oxford" title="Brasenose College, Oxford">Brasenose College</a>.</p><p>After leaving Eton in 1984, Cameron started a nine-month <a href="/wiki/Gap_year" title="Gap year">gap year</a>. For three months he worked as a researcher for his godfather <a href="/wiki/Tim_Rathbone" title="Tim Rathbone">Tim Rathbone</a>, then Conservative MP for <a href="/wiki/Lewes_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="Lewes (UK Parliament constituency)">Lewes</a>, during which time he attended debates in the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="House of Commons of the United Kingdom">House of Commons</a>. Through his father, he was then employed for a further three months in <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> by <a href="/wiki/Jardine_Matheson" title="Jardine Matheson">Jardine Matheson</a> as a &apos;ship jumper&apos;, an administrative post.</p><p>Returning from Hong Kong, Cameron visited the then <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, where he was approached by two <a href="/wiki/Russians" title="Russians">Russian</a> men speaking fluent English. Cameron was later told by one of his professors that it was &quot;definitely an attempt&quot; by the <a href="/wiki/KGB" title="KGB">KGB</a> to recruit him.</p><p>In October 1985, Cameron began his <a href="/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts" title="Bachelor of Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> course in <a href="/wiki/Philosophy,_Politics_and_Economics" title="Philosophy, Politics and Economics">Philosophy, Politics and Economics</a> (PPE) at Brasenose College, Oxford. His tutor, <a href="/wiki/Professor" title="Professor">Professor</a> <a href="/wiki/Vernon_Bogdanor" title="Vernon Bogdanor">Vernon Bogdanor</a>, has described him as &quot;one of the ablest&quot; students he has taught, with &quot;moderate and sensible Conservative&quot; <a href="/wiki/Ideology" title="Ideology">political views</a>.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Guy_Spier" title="Guy Spier">Guy Spier</a>, who shared tutorials with him, remembers him as an outstanding student: &quot;We were doing our best to grasp basic economic concepts. David&#x2014;there was nobody else who came even close. He would be integrating them with the way the British political system is put together. He could have lectured me on it, and I would have sat there and taken notes.&quot; When commenting in 2006 on his former pupil&apos;s ideas about a &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; to replace the <a href="/wiki/Human_Rights_Act_1998" title="Human Rights Act 1998">Human Rights Act</a>, however, Professor Bogdanor, himself a <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Democrats" title="Liberal Democrats">Liberal Democrat</a>, said, &quot;I think he is very confused. I&apos;ve read his speech and it&apos;s filled with contradictions. There are one or two good things in it but one glimpses them, as it were, through a mist of misunderstanding&quot;.</p><p>While at Oxford, Cameron was a member of the student dining society the <a href="/wiki/Bullingdon_Club" title="Bullingdon Club">Bullingdon Club</a>, which has a reputation for an outlandish drinking culture associated with boisterous behaviour and damaging property. Cameron&apos;s period in the Bullingdon Club was examined in a Channel 4 docu-drama, <i><a href="/wiki/When_Boris_Met_Dave" title="When Boris Met Dave">When Boris Met Dave</a></i>.</p><p>Cameron graduated in 1988 with a <a href="/wiki/First-class_honours" class="mw-redirect" title="First-class honours">first-class honours</a> BA degree (later promoted to an <a href="/wiki/Master_of_Arts_(Oxbridge_and_Dublin)" title="Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)">MA</a> by seniority).</p><p>After graduation, Cameron worked for the <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Research_Department" title="Conservative Research Department">Conservative Research Department</a> between September 1988 and 1993. His first brief was Trade and Industry, Energy and Privatisation, and he befriended fellow young colleagues including <a href="/wiki/Edward_Llewellyn_(Conservative_adviser)" title="Edward Llewellyn (Conservative adviser)">Edward Llewellyn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ed_Vaizey" title="Ed Vaizey">Ed Vaizey</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rachel_Whetstone" title="Rachel Whetstone">Rachel Whetstone</a>. They and others formed a group they called the &quot;<a href="/wiki/Smith_Square" title="Smith Square">Smith Square</a> set&quot;, which was dubbed the &quot;Brat Pack&quot; by the press, though it is better known as the &quot;<a href="/wiki/Notting_Hill_set" title="Notting Hill set">Notting Hill set</a>&quot;, a name given to it pejoratively by <a href="/wiki/Derek_Conway" title="Derek Conway">Derek Conway</a>. In 1991, Cameron was seconded to <a href="/wiki/Downing_Street" title="Downing Street">Downing Street</a> to work on briefing <a href="/wiki/John_Major" title="John Major">John Major</a> for the then bi-weekly sessions of <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister%27s_Questions" title="Prime Minister&apos;s Questions">Prime Minister&apos;s Questions</a>. One newspaper gave Cameron the credit for &quot;sharper&#xA0;... <a href="/wiki/Despatch_box" title="Despatch box">Despatch box</a> performances&quot; by Major, which included highlighting for Major &quot;a dreadful piece of <a href="/wiki/Doublespeak" title="Doublespeak">doublespeak</a>&quot; by <a href="/wiki/Tony_Blair" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> (then the <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour</a> Employment spokesman) over the effect of a national <a href="/wiki/Minimum_wage" title="Minimum wage">minimum wage</a>. He became head of the political section of the Conservative Research Department, and in August 1991 was tipped to follow <a href="/wiki/Judith_Chaplin" title="Judith Chaplin">Judith Chaplin</a> as Political Secretary to the Prime Minister.</p><p>However, Cameron lost to <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Hill,_Baron_Hill_of_Oareford" title="Jonathan Hill, Baron Hill of Oareford">Jonathan Hill</a>, who was appointed in March 1992. Instead, Cameron was given the responsibility for briefing Major for his press conferences during the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1992" title="United Kingdom general election, 1992">1992 general election</a>. During the campaign, Cameron was one of the young &quot;brat pack&quot; of party strategists who worked between 12 and 20 hours a day, sleeping in the house of <a href="/wiki/Alan_Duncan" title="Alan Duncan">Alan Duncan</a> in <a href="/wiki/Smith_Square" title="Smith Square">Gayfere Street</a>, <a href="/wiki/Westminster" title="Westminster">Westminster</a>, which had been Major&apos;s campaign headquarters during his bid for the Conservative leadership. Cameron headed the economic section; it was while working on this campaign that Cameron first worked closely with and befriended <a href="/wiki/Steve_Hilton" title="Steve Hilton">Steve Hilton</a>, who was later to become Director of Strategy during his party leadership. The strain of getting up at 04:45 every day was reported to have led Cameron to decide to leave politics in favour of journalism.</p><p>The Conservatives&apos; unexpected success in the 1992 election led Cameron to hit back at older party members who had criticised him and his colleagues, saying &quot;whatever people say about us, we got the campaign right,&quot; and that they had listened to their campaign workers on the ground rather than the newspapers. He revealed he had led other members of the team across <a href="/wiki/Smith_Square" title="Smith Square">Smith Square</a> to jeer at <a href="/wiki/Transport_House" title="Transport House">Transport House</a>, the former Labour headquarters. Cameron was rewarded with a promotion to <a href="/wiki/Special_advisers_(UK_government)" title="Special advisers (UK government)">Special Adviser</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer" title="Chancellor of the Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Norman_Lamont" title="Norman Lamont">Norman Lamont</a>.</p><p>Cameron was working for Lamont at the time of <a href="/wiki/Black_Wednesday" title="Black Wednesday">Black Wednesday</a>, when pressure from currency speculators forced the <a href="/wiki/Pound_sterling" title="Pound sterling">pound sterling</a> out of the <a href="/wiki/European_Exchange_Rate_Mechanism" title="European Exchange Rate Mechanism">European Exchange Rate Mechanism</a>. At the 1992 Conservative Party conference, Cameron had difficulty trying to arrange to brief the speakers in the economic debate, having to resort to putting messages on the internal television system imploring the mover of the motion, <a href="/wiki/Patricia_Morris,_Baroness_Morris_of_Bolton" title="Patricia Morris, Baroness Morris of Bolton">Patricia Morris</a>, to contact him. Later that month Cameron joined a delegation of Special Advisers who visited Germany to build better relations with the <a href="/wiki/Christian_Democratic_Union_of_Germany" title="Christian Democratic Union of Germany">Christian Democratic Union</a>; he was reported to be &quot;still smarting&quot; over the <a href="/wiki/Deutsche_Bundesbank" title="Deutsche Bundesbank">Bundesbank</a>&apos;s contribution to the economic crisis.</p><p>Lamont fell out with <a href="/wiki/John_Major" title="John Major">John Major</a> after Black Wednesday and became highly unpopular with the public. Taxes needed to be raised in the 1993 Budget, and Cameron fed the options Lamont was considering through to <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Campaign_Headquarters" title="Conservative Campaign Headquarters">Conservative Campaign Headquarters</a> for their political acceptability to be assessed. By May 1993, the Conservatives&apos; average poll rating dropped below 30%, where they would remain until the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1997" title="United Kingdom general election, 1997">1997 general election</a>. Major and Lamont&apos;s personal ratings also declined dramatically. However, Lamont&apos;s unpopularity did not necessarily affect Cameron: he was considered as a potential &quot;<a href="/wiki/Kamikaze" title="Kamikaze">kamikaze</a>&quot; candidate for the <a href="/wiki/Newbury_by-election,_1993" title="Newbury by-election, 1993">Newbury by-election</a>, which includes the area where he grew up. However, Cameron decided not to stand.</p><p>During the by-election, Lamont gave the response &quot;<a href="/wiki/Non,_je_ne_regrette_rien" title="Non, je ne regrette rien">Je ne regrette rien</a>&quot; to a question about whether he most regretted claiming to see &quot;the green shoots of recovery&quot; or admitting to &quot;singing in his bath&quot; with happiness at leaving the <a href="/wiki/European_Exchange_Rate_Mechanism" title="European Exchange Rate Mechanism">European Exchange Rate Mechanism</a>. Cameron was identified by one journalist as having inspired this gaffe; it was speculated that the heavy Conservative defeat in Newbury may have cost Cameron his chance of becoming Chancellor himself, even though as he was not a Member of Parliament he could not have been. Lamont was sacked at the end of May 1993, and decided not to write the usual letter of resignation; Cameron was given the responsibility to issue to the press a statement of self-justification.</p><p>After Lamont was sacked, Cameron remained at the <a href="/wiki/HM_Treasury" title="HM Treasury">Treasury</a> for less than a month before being specifically recruited by <a href="/wiki/Home_Secretary" title="Home Secretary">Home Secretary</a> <a href="/wiki/Michael_Howard" title="Michael Howard">Michael Howard</a>. It was commented that he was still &quot;very much in favour&quot; and it was later reported that many at the Treasury would have preferred Cameron to carry on. At the beginning of September 1993, Cameron applied to go on Conservative Central Office&apos;s list of Prospective Parliamentary Candidates.</p><p>Cameron was much more socially liberal than Howard but enjoyed working for him. According to <a href="/wiki/Derek_Lewis_(prison_governor)" title="Derek Lewis (prison governor)">Derek Lewis</a>, then Director-General of <a href="/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Prison_Service" title="Her Majesty&apos;s Prison Service">Her Majesty&apos;s Prison Service</a>, Cameron showed him a &quot;his and hers list&quot; of proposals made by Howard and his wife, Sandra. Lewis said that <a href="/wiki/Sandra_Howard" title="Sandra Howard">Sandra Howard</a>&apos;s list included reducing the quality of <a href="/wiki/Prison_food" title="Prison food">prison food</a>, although Sandra Howard denied this claim. Lewis reported that Cameron was &quot;uncomfortable&quot; about the list. In defending Sandra Howard and insisting that she made no such proposal, the journalist <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Anderson_(columnist)" title="Bruce Anderson (columnist)">Bruce Anderson</a> wrote that Cameron had proposed a much shorter definition on prison catering which revolved around the phrase &quot;balanced diet&quot;, and that Lewis had written thanking Cameron for a valuable contribution.</p><p>During his work for Howard, Cameron often briefed the media. In March 1994, someone leaked to the press that the Labour Party had called for a meeting with John Major to discuss a consensus on the <a href="/wiki/Prevention_of_Terrorism_Acts" title="Prevention of Terrorism Acts">Prevention of Terrorism Act</a>. After an inquiry failed to find the source of the leak, Labour MP <a href="/wiki/Peter_Mandelson" title="Peter Mandelson">Peter Mandelson</a> demanded assurance from Howard that Cameron had not been responsible, which Howard gave. A senior <a href="/wiki/Home_Office" title="Home Office">Home Office</a> civil servant noted the influence of Howard&apos;s Special Advisers, saying previous incumbents &quot;would listen to the evidence before making a decision. Howard just talks to young public school gentlemen from the party headquarters.&quot;</p><p>In July 1994, Cameron left his role as Special Adviser to work as the Director of Corporate Affairs at <a href="/wiki/Carlton_Communications" title="Carlton Communications">Carlton Communications</a>. Carlton, which had won the <a href="/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)" title="ITV (TV network)">ITV</a> franchise for London weekdays in 1991, was a growing media company which also had film-distribution and video-producing arms. Cameron was suggested for the role to Carlton executive chairman <a href="/wiki/Michael_P._Green" title="Michael P. Green">Michael P. Green</a> by his later mother-in-law Lady Astor. Cameron left Carlton to run for Parliament in 1997, returning to his job after his defeat.</p><p>In 1997, Cameron played up the Company&apos;s prospects for <a href="/wiki/Digital_terrestrial_television" title="Digital terrestrial television">digital terrestrial television</a>, for which it joined with <a href="/wiki/ITV_Granada" title="ITV Granada">ITV Granada</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sky_(United_Kingdom)" title="Sky (United Kingdom)">Sky</a> to form <a href="/wiki/ITV_Digital" title="ITV Digital">British Digital Broadcasting</a>. In a roundtable discussion on the future of broadcasting in 1998 he criticised the effect of overlapping different regulators on the industry. Carlton&apos;s consortium did win the digital terrestrial franchise but the resulting company suffered difficulties in attracting subscribers. Cameron resigned as Director of Corporate Affairs in February 2001 in order to run for Parliament for a second time, although he remained on the payroll as a consultant.</p><p>Having been approved for the Candidates&apos; list, Cameron began looking for a seat to contest for the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1997" title="United Kingdom general election, 1997">1997 general election</a>. He was reported to have missed out on selection for <a href="/wiki/Ashford_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="Ashford (UK Parliament constituency)">Ashford</a> in December 1994 after failing to get to the selection meeting as a result of train delays. In January 1996, when two shortlisted contenders dropped out, Cameron was interviewed and subsequently selected for <a href="/wiki/Stafford_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="Stafford (UK Parliament constituency)">Stafford</a>, a constituency revised in boundary changes, which was projected to have a Conservative majority. The incumbent Conservative MP, <a href="/wiki/Bill_Cash" title="Bill Cash">Bill Cash</a>, ran instead in the neighbouring constituency of <a href="/wiki/Stone_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="Stone (UK Parliament constituency)">Stone</a>, where he was re-elected. At the 1996 Conservative Party Conference, Cameron called for <a href="/wiki/Tax_cut" title="Tax cut">tax cuts</a> in the forthcoming Budget to be targeted at the low-paid and to &quot;small businesses where people took money out of their own pockets to put into companies to keep them going&quot;. He also said the Party &quot;should be proud of the Tory tax record but that people needed reminding of its achievements&#xA0;... It&apos;s time to return to our tax-cutting agenda. The socialist Prime Ministers of Europe have endorsed <a href="/wiki/Tony_Blair" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> because they want a federal pussy cat and not a British lion.&quot;</p><p>When writing his election address, Cameron made his own opposition to British membership of the <a href="/wiki/Euro" title="Euro">single European currency</a> clear, pledging not to support it. This was a break with official Conservative policy but about 200 other candidates were making similar declarations. Otherwise, Cameron kept closely to the national <a href="/wiki/Party_line_(politics)" title="Party line (politics)">party line</a>.

He said that <a href="/wiki/John_Prescott" title="John Prescott">John Prescott</a> &quot;clearly looks a fool&quot; after Prescott&apos;s personal indiscretions were revealed in spring 2006, and wondered if the Deputy Prime Minister had broken the ministerial code.

Right-wing Conservative MP <a href="/wiki/Bob_Spink" title="Bob Spink">Bob Spink</a>, who later defected to UKIP, also criticised the remarks, as did <i><a href="/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph" title="The Daily Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a></i>.

However, Michael Mosbacher, co-founder of <i><a href="/wiki/Standpoint_(magazine)" title="Standpoint (magazine)">Standpoint</a></i> magazine, wrote that Cameron&apos;s Cabinet has the lowest number of Etonians of any past Conservative government: &quot;David Cameron&apos;s government is the least patrician, least wealthy and least public-school-educated&#x2014;indeed the least Etonian Conservative-led government this country has ever seen&quot;.</p><p>In 2006 Cameron described poverty as a &quot;moral disgrace&quot; and promised to tackle <a href="/wiki/Poverty#Relative_poverty" title="Poverty">relative poverty</a>. In 2007 Cameron promised, &quot;We can make British poverty history, and we will make British poverty history&quot;. Also in 2007 he stated &quot;Ending child poverty is central to improving child well-being&quot;. In 2015 <a href="/wiki/Polly_Toynbee" title="Polly Toynbee">Polly Toynbee</a> questioned Cameron&apos;s commitment to tackling poverty, contrasting his earlier statements agreeing that &quot;poverty is relative&quot; with proposals to change the government&apos;s poverty measure, and saying that cuts in <a href="/wiki/George_Osborne#2015.E2.80.93present" title="George Osborne">child tax credits</a> would increase child poverty among low-paid working families.</p><p>The rapid growth in the use of food banks under David Cameron became one of the major criticisms of his administration, and a recurring theme at Prime Minister&apos;s Questions. Cameron praised volunteers providing donated food as &quot;part of what I call the <a href="/wiki/Big_Society" title="Big Society">Big Society</a>&quot;, to which responded that he &quot;never thought the Big Society was about feeding hungry children in Britain&quot;.</p><p>In February 2014, 27 <a href="/wiki/Anglican_bishop" class="mw-redirect" title="Anglican bishop">Anglican bishops</a> together with leading <a href="/wiki/Methodism" title="Methodism">Methodists</a> and <a href="/wiki/Quakers" title="Quakers">Quakers</a> wrote an <a href="/wiki/Open_letter" title="Open letter">open letter</a> to Cameron blaming government policy for a rise in the use of <a href="/wiki/Food_bank#United_Kingdom" title="Food bank">food banks</a>. The letter asserted that &quot;over half of people using food banks have been put in that situation by cutbacks to and failures in the benefit system, whether it be payment delays or punitive sanctions&quot;. The government responded that delays in benefit processing had been reduced, with the proportion of benefits paid on time rising from 88&#x2013;89% under Labour, to 96&#x2013;97% in 2014. Cameron said that the rise in food bank usage was due to the government encouraging Jobcentres and local authorities to promote them, and noted an OECD report which showed a fall in the proportion of people in Britain struggling to buy food.</p><p>During the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_parliamentary_expenses_scandal" title="United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal">MPs expenses scandal</a> in 2009, Cameron said he would lead Conservatives in repaying &quot;excessive&quot; expenses and threatened to expel MPs that refused after the expense claims of several members of his shadow cabinet had been questioned:</p><p>We have to acknowledge just how bad this is, the public are really angry and we have to start by saying, &quot;Look, this system that we have, that we used, that we operated, that we took part in&#x2014;it was wrong and we are sorry about that&quot;.</p><p>One day later, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph" title="The Daily Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a></i> published figures showing over five years he had claimed &#xA3;82,450 on his second home allowance. Cameron repaid &#xA3;680 claimed for repairs to his constituency home. Although he was not accused of breaking any rules, Cameron was placed on the defensive over mortgage interest expense claims covering his constituency home, after a report in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Mail_on_Sunday" title="The Mail on Sunday">The Mail on Sunday</a></i> suggested he could have reduced the mortgage interest bill by putting an additional &#xA3;75000 of his own money towards purchasing the home in Witney instead of paying off an earlier mortgage on his London home. Cameron said that doing things differently would not have saved the taxpayer any money, as he was paying more on mortgage interest than he was able to reclaim as expenses anyway He also spoke out in favour of laws giving voters the power to &quot;recall&quot; or &quot;sack&quot; MPs accused of wrongdoing. In April 2014, he was criticised for his handling of the expenses row surrounding Culture Secretary <a href="/wiki/Maria_Miller" title="Maria Miller">Maria Miller</a>, when he rejected calls from fellow Conservative MPs to sack her from the front bench.</p><p>At the launch of the Conservative Party&apos;s education <a href="/wiki/Manifesto" title="Manifesto">manifesto</a> in January 2010, Cameron declared an admiration for the &quot;brazenly elite&quot; approach to education of countries such as <a href="/wiki/Singapore" title="Singapore">Singapore</a> and <a href="/wiki/South_Korea" title="South Korea">South Korea</a> and expressed a desire to &quot;elevate the status of teaching in our country&quot;. He suggested the adoption of more stringent criteria for entry to teaching and offered repayment of the loans of maths and science graduates obtaining first or 2.1 degrees from &quot;good&quot; universities.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Wes_Streeting" title="Wes Streeting">Wes Streeting</a>, then president of the <a href="/wiki/National_Union_of_Students_(United_Kingdom)" title="National Union of Students (United Kingdom)">National Union of Students</a>, said &quot;The message that the Conservatives are sending to the majority of students is that if you didn&apos;t go to a university attended by members of the Shadow Cabinet, they don&apos;t believe you&apos;re worth as much.&quot;</p><p>Commenting on rail fare increases in January 2015, Cameron said &quot;We&apos;ve made sure that rail fares cannot go up by more than inflation. So the rail fare increase this year, as last year, is linked to inflation, and I think that&apos;s right. In previous years it&apos;s gone up by more than inflation. But, of course, what you&apos;re seeing on our railways is a &#xA3;38bn investment project. And that money is coming, of course, from taxpayers, from the government, and from farepayers as well.&quot; He described the policies of his government as &quot;the biggest investment in our roads since the 1970s, but in our railways since Victorian times&quot;.</p><p>In April 2009, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Independent" title="The Independent">The Independent</a></i> reported that in 1989, while <a href="/wiki/Nelson_Mandela" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> remained imprisoned under the <a href="/wiki/Apartheid" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a> regime, David Cameron had accepted a trip to South Africa paid for by an anti-sanctions lobby firm. A spokesperson for Cameron responded by saying that the Conservative Party was at that time opposed to <a href="/wiki/Economic_sanctions" title="Economic sanctions">sanctions</a> against South Africa and that his trip was a fact-finding mission. However, the newspaper reported that Cameron&apos;s then superior at Conservative Research Department called the trip &quot;jolly&quot;, saying that &quot;it was all terribly relaxed, just a little treat, a perk of the job. The <a href="/wiki/P._W._Botha" title="P. W. Botha">Botha</a> regime was attempting to make itself look less horrible, but I don&apos;t regard it as having been of the faintest political consequence.&quot; Cameron distanced himself from his party&apos;s history of opposing sanctions against the regime. He was criticised by Labour MP <a href="/wiki/Peter_Hain" title="Peter Hain">Peter Hain</a>, himself an anti-apartheid campaigner.</p><p>In an interview on <i><a href="/wiki/Friday_Night_with_Jonathan_Ross" title="Friday Night with Jonathan Ross">Friday Night with Jonathan Ross</a></i> in 2006, Cameron said that he supported the decision of the then Labour Government to go to <a href="/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">war in Iraq</a>, and said that he thought supporters should &quot;see it through&quot;. He also supported a motion brought by the SNP and Plaid Cymru in 2006 calling for an inquiry into the government&apos;s conduct of the Iraq war. In 2011, he oversaw the withdrawal of British soldiers from Iraq. He has repeatedly called for the <a href="/wiki/Chilcot_Inquiry" class="mw-redirect" title="Chilcot Inquiry">Chilcot Inquiry</a> into the Iraq war to conclude and publish its findings, saying &quot;People want to know the truth&quot;</p><p>Libya&#x2013;United Kingdom relations soured in 2011 with the outbreak of the <a href="/wiki/Libyan_Civil_War_(2011)" title="Libyan Civil War (2011)">Libyan Civil War</a>. Cameron condemned the &quot;appalling and unacceptable&quot; violence used against anti-Gaddafi protesters. After weeks of lobbying by the UK and its allies, on 17 March 2011 the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" title="United Nations Security Council">United Nations Security Council</a> approved a <a href="/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_Libya" title="2011 military intervention in Libya">no-fly zone</a> to prevent government forces loyal to <a href="/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi" title="Muammar Gaddafi">Muammar Gaddafi</a> from carrying out air attacks on <a href="/wiki/Anti-Gaddafi_forces" title="Anti-Gaddafi forces">anti-Gaddafi rebels</a>. Two days later the UK and the United States fired more than 110 <a href="/wiki/Tomahawk_(missile)" title="Tomahawk (missile)">Tomahawk missiles</a> at targets in Libya.</p><p>Cameron has said he is &quot;proud&quot; of the role United Kingdom played in the overthrow of Gaddafi&apos;s government. Cameron also stated that UK had played a &quot;very important role&quot;, adding that &quot;a lot of people said that Tripoli was completely different to Benghazi and that the two don&apos;t get on&#x2014;they were wrong. ... People who said &apos;this is all going to be an enormous swamp of Islamists and extremists&apos;&#x2014;they were wrong.&quot;</p><p>In March 2016, with two main rival factions based in Tripoli and Benghazi continuing to fight, an <i>Independent</i> editorial noted that &quot;there can be no question that Libya is broken. There are three nominal governments, none of which holds much authority. The economy is flatlining. Refugees flood to the Mediterranean. And Isis has put down roots in Sirte and, increasingly, Tripoli.&quot; It was at this time that U.S. President <a href="/wiki/Barack_Obama" title="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a> accused Cameron of allowing Libya to sink into a &quot;mess&quot;, though in private the American leader bluntly describes post-intervention Libya as a &quot;shit show&quot;.</p><p>In August 2013, Cameron lost a motion in favour of bombing Syrian armed forces in response to the <a href="/wiki/Ghouta_chemical_attack" title="Ghouta chemical attack">Ghouta chemical attack</a>, becoming the first prime minister to suffer such a foreign-policy defeat since 1782. In September 2014, MPs passed a motion in favour of British planes joining, at the request of the Iraqi government, a bombing campaign against <a href="/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant" title="Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant">Islamic State</a> (IS) targets in Iraq; the motion explicitly expressed parliament&apos;s disapproval of UK military action in Syria. Cameron promised that, before expanding UK air strikes to include IS units in Syria, he would seek parliamentary approval.</p><p>In July 2015, a <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_information_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="Freedom of information in the United Kingdom">Freedom of Information</a> (FOI) request by <a href="/wiki/Reprieve_(organisation)" title="Reprieve (organisation)">Reprieve</a> revealed that, without the knowledge of UK parliamentarians, RAF pilots had, in fact, been bombing targets in Syria, and that Cameron knew of this. The prime minister, along with Defence Secretary <a href="/wiki/Michael_Fallon" title="Michael Fallon">Michael Fallon</a>, faced strong criticism, including from Tory MPs, for not informing the Commons about this deployment; the Ministry of Defence said that the pilots concerned were &quot;embedded&quot; with foreign military forces, and so were &quot;effectively&quot; operating as such, while Fallon denied that MPs had been, as he put it, &quot;kept in the dark&quot;. The Reprieve FoI request also revealed that British drone pilots had been embedded, almost continuously, with American forces at <a href="/wiki/Creech_Air_Force_Base" title="Creech Air Force Base">Creech Air Force Base</a> since 2008. These drone operators, who were &quot;a gift of services&quot;, meaning the UK still paid their salaries and covered their expenses, had been carrying out operations that included reconnaissance in Syria to assist American strikes against IS.</p><p>Fallon said that it was &quot;illogical&quot; for the UK not to bomb ISIL in Syria as the organisation does not &quot;differentiate between Syria and Iraq&quot; and is &quot;organised and directed and administered from Syria&quot;. Following the <a href="/wiki/November_2015_Paris_attacks" title="November 2015 Paris attacks">terrorist attacks on Paris</a> in November 2015, for which Islamic State claimed responsibility, Cameron began pushing for a strategy for the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Air_Force" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a> to bomb Syria in retaliation. Cameron set out his case for military intervention to Parliament on 26 November, telling MPs that it was the only way to guarantee Britain&apos;s safety and would be part of a &quot;comprehensive&quot; strategy to defeat IS. On 3 December 2015 MPs voted 397&#x2013;223 in favour of launching air strikes against ISIL targets in Syria. The vote for military action was supported by all but seven members of the Parliamentary Conservative Party, as well as 66 Labour MPs who backed the government in defiance of their leader, <a href="/wiki/Jeremy_Corbyn" title="Jeremy Corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a>, who had expressed his opposition to air strikes.</p><p>In 2013, in response to <a href="/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>&apos;s calls for negotiations over the <a href="/wiki/Falkland_Islands" title="Falkland Islands">Falkland Islands</a>&apos; sovereignty, a referendum was called asking <a href="/wiki/Falkland_Islanders" title="Falkland Islanders">Falkland Islanders</a> whether they supported the continuation of their status as an <a href="/wiki/British_Overseas_Territories" title="British Overseas Territories">Overseas Territory</a> of the United Kingdom. With a turnout of 91.94%, an overwhelming 99.8% voted to remain a British territory with only three votes against.</p><p>In light of this, Cameron said:</p><p>We believe in the Falkland islanders&apos; right to self-determination. They had a referendum. They couldn&apos;t have been more clear about wanting to remain with our country and we should protect and defend them.</p><p>Cameron has been a strong advocate of increased ties between India and the United Kingdom, describing Indian&#x2013;British relations as the &quot;New <a href="/wiki/Special_Relationship" title="Special Relationship">Special Relationship</a>&quot; in 2010.</p><p>In October 2012, as <a href="/wiki/Narendra_Modi" title="Narendra Modi">Narendra Modi</a> rose to prominence in India, the UK rescinded its boycott of the then-<a href="/wiki/Gujarat" title="Gujarat">Gujarat</a> state Chief Minister over <a href="/wiki/2002_Gujarat_riots" title="2002 Gujarat riots">religious riots in Gujarat</a> in 2002 that left more than 2,000 dead, and in November 2013, Cameron commented that he was &quot;open&quot; to meeting Modi.</p><p>Modi was later elected as Prime Minister in a landslide majority, leading to Cameron calling Modi and congratulating him on the &quot;election success&quot;, one of the first Western leaders to do so.</p><p>Cameron reiterated calls for an independent investigation into the <a href="/wiki/Alleged_war_crimes_during_the_final_stages_of_the_Sri_Lankan_Civil_War" title="Alleged war crimes during the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War">alleged war crimes during the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War</a>. &quot;There needs to be proper inquiries into what happened at the end of the war, there needs to be proper human rights, democracy for the <a href="/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils" title="Sri Lankan Tamils">Tamil minority</a> in that country&quot; Cameron stated. He stated that, if this investigation was not completed by March 2014, he would press for an independent international inquiry. This followed a visit to <a href="/wiki/Jaffna" title="Jaffna">Jaffna</a>, a war-ravaged town in the northern part of <a href="/wiki/Sri_Lanka" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>; Cameron was the first foreign leader to visit Jaffna since the island once colonised by Britain became independent in 1948. Cameron was mobbed by demonstrators, mostly women, seeking his assistance in tracing <a href="/wiki/Missing_person" title="Missing person">missing relatives</a>.</p><p>In a speech in <a href="/wiki/Ankara" title="Ankara">Ankara</a> in July 2010, Cameron stated unequivocally his support for Turkey&apos;s accession to the EU, citing economic, security and political considerations, and claimed that those who opposed Turkish membership were driven by &quot;protectionism, narrow nationalism or prejudice&quot;. In that speech, he was also critical of Israeli action during the <a href="/wiki/Gaza_flotilla_raid" title="Gaza flotilla raid">Gaza flotilla raid</a> and its Gaza policy, and repeated his opinion that Israel had turned Gaza into a &quot;prison camp&quot;, having previously referred to Gaza as &quot;a giant open prison&quot;. These views were met with mixed reactions. The Cameron government does not formally recognise the Ottoman Empire&apos;s massacres of Armenians as a &quot;genocide&quot;.</p><p>At the end of May 2011, Cameron stepped down as patron of the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_National_Fund" title="Jewish National Fund">Jewish National Fund</a>, becoming the first British prime minister not to be patron of the charity in the 110 years of its existence.</p><p>In a speech in 2011 Cameron said: &quot;You have a Prime Minister whose commitment and determination to work for peace in Israel is deep and strong. Britain will continue to push for peace, but will always stand up for Israel against those who wish her harm&quot;. He said he wanted to reaffirm his &quot;unshakable&quot; belief in Israel within the same message. He also voiced his opposition to the Goldstone Report, claiming it had been biased against Israel and not enough blame had been placed on Hamas.</p><p>In March 2014, during his first visit to Israel as Prime Minister, Cameron addressed Israel&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Knesset" title="Knesset">Knesset</a> in <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, where he offered his full support for peace efforts between Israelis and Palestinians, hoping a two-state solution might be achieved.

In 2008, he wanted lesbians who receive IVF treatment to be required to name a father figure, which received condemnation from LGBT equality groups. However, Cameron supported commitment for gay couples in a 2005 speech, and in October 2011 urged Conservative MPs to support gay marriage.</p><p>In November 2012, Cameron and Nick Clegg agreed to fast-track legislation for introducing same-sex marriage. Cameron stated that he wanted to give religious groups the ability to host gay <a href="/wiki/Marriage" title="Marriage">marriage</a> ceremonies, and that he did not want to exclude gay people from a &quot;great institution&quot;. In 2013, the <a href="/wiki/Marriage_(Same_Sex_Couples)_Act_2013" title="Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013">Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013</a> became law despite opposition from more than half of his fellow Conservative MPs, including Cabinet ministers <a href="/wiki/Owen_Paterson" title="Owen Paterson">Owen Paterson</a> and <a href="/wiki/David_Jones_(Clwyd_West_MP)" title="David Jones (Clwyd West MP)">David Jones</a>.

He said in July 2013 that &quot;in the last decade we have had an immigration policy that&apos;s completely lax. The pressure it puts on our public services and communities is too great.&quot; In 2015, <i>The Independent</i> reported, &quot;The Conservatives have failed spectacularly to deliver their pledge to reduce net migration to less than 100,000 a year. The <a href="/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics" title="Office for National Statistics">Office for National Statistics</a> (ONS) announced a net flow of 298,000 migrants to the UK in the 12 months to September 2014&#x2014;up from 210,000 in the previous year.&quot;</p><p>During the leadership election, allegations were made that Cameron had used <a href="/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)" title="Cannabis (drug)">cannabis</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cocaine" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a> recreationally before becoming an MP. Pressed on this point during the BBC television programme <i><a href="/wiki/Question_Time_(TV_series)" title="Question Time (TV series)">Question Time</a></i>, Cameron expressed the view that everybody was allowed to &quot;err and stray&quot; in their past. During his 2005 Conservative leadership campaign he addressed the question of drug consumption by remarking that &quot;I did lots of things before I came into politics which I shouldn&apos;t have done. We all did.&quot;</p><p>In 2014, Cameron dismissed warnings that his cuts to the UK defence budget had left it less than a &quot;first class-player in terms of defence&quot; and no longer a &quot;full partner&quot; to the United States.</p><p>In the July 2015 budget Chancellor George Osborne announced that the UK defence spending would meet the NATO target of 2% of GDP.</p><p>In January 2016, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Independent" title="The Independent">The Independent</a></i> said there had been an increase of over 50% in the use of <a href="/wiki/Statutory_Instrument_(UK)" title="Statutory Instrument (UK)">statutory instruments</a> since 2010. <a href="/wiki/Michael_Jopling,_Baron_Jopling" title="Michael Jopling, Baron Jopling">Lord Jopling</a> deplored the behaviour which he called an abuse whilst <a href="/wiki/Angela_Smith,_Baroness_Smith_of_Basildon" title="Angela Smith, Baroness Smith of Basildon">The Baroness Smith of Basildon</a> asked whether it was the start of &quot;constitutional <a href="/wiki/Gerrymandering" title="Gerrymandering">Gerrymandering</a>.&quot;</p><p>In the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_local_elections,_2012" title="United Kingdom local elections, 2012">2012 local elections</a>, the Conservative Party&apos;s share of the vote fell from 35% to 31%, losing control of several councils including <a href="/wiki/Plymouth" title="Plymouth">Plymouth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Southampton" title="Southampton">Southampton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Harlow" title="Harlow">Harlow</a>, <a href="/wiki/Redditch" title="Redditch">Redditch</a>, <a href="/wiki/Worcester" title="Worcester">Worcester</a> and <a href="/wiki/Great_Yarmouth" title="Great Yarmouth">Great Yarmouth</a>, after a difficult few months for the government, with Labour increasing its lead in the polls. This led to concerns from Conservative MPs about Cameron&apos;s leadership and his electability. <a href="/wiki/David_Davies_(Welsh_politician)" title="David Davies (Welsh politician)">David Davies</a>, the chairman of the <a href="/wiki/Welsh_Affairs_Select_Committee" title="Welsh Affairs Select Committee">Welsh Affairs Select Committee</a>, accused the Tory leadership of &quot;incompetence&quot; and hinted that it could risk Cameron&apos;s leadership. <a href="/wiki/Nadine_Dorries" title="Nadine Dorries">Nadine Dorries</a> warned the Prime Minister that a leadership challenge could happen.</p><p>Later that year, <a href="/wiki/Brian_Binley" title="Brian Binley">Brian Binley</a> openly said that Cameron&apos;s leadership was like being a &quot;maid&quot; to the Liberal Democrats, and accused him of leading the party to defeat. In January 2013 it was revealed that <a href="/wiki/Adam_Afriyie" title="Adam Afriyie">Adam Afriyie</a> was planning his own bid for the Tory leadership with the support of fellow MPs <a href="/wiki/Mark_Field" title="Mark Field">Mark Field</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bill_Wiggin" title="Bill Wiggin">Bill Wiggin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chris_Heaton-Harris" title="Chris Heaton-Harris">Chris Heaton-Harris</a>, <a href="/wiki/Patrick_Mercer" title="Patrick Mercer">Patrick Mercer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Djanogly" title="Jonathan Djanogly">Jonathan Djanogly</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dan_Byles" title="Dan Byles">Dan Byles</a>. <i><a href="/wiki/The_Times" title="The Times">The Times</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/ConservativeHome" title="ConservativeHome">ConservativeHome</a></i> revealed that a &apos;rebel reserve&apos; of 55 Tory MPs gave firm pledges to a co-ordinating MP to support a motion of &apos;no confidence&apos; and write to Brady simultaneously, which would be enough MPs to trigger a vote of no confidence as the level of MPs needed to trigger such vote is 46. <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Bridgen" title="Andrew Bridgen">Andrew Bridgen</a> openly called for a vote of confidence in Cameron&apos;s leadership and claimed that the Prime Minister had a &quot;credibility problem&quot; but he dropped his bid for a contest a year later.</p><p>In 2007 Cameron appointed <a href="/wiki/Andy_Coulson" title="Andy Coulson">Andy Coulson</a>, former editor of the <i><a href="/wiki/News_of_the_World" title="News of the World">News of the World</a></i>, as his director of communications. Coulson had resigned as the paper&apos;s editor following the conviction of a reporter in relation to <a href="/wiki/News_International_phone_hacking_scandal" title="News International phone hacking scandal">illegal phone hacking</a>, although stating that he knew nothing about it. In June 2010 <a href="/wiki/Downing_Street" title="Downing Street">Downing Street</a> confirmed Coulson&apos;s annual salary as &#xA3;140,000, the highest pay of any special adviser to UK Government.</p><p>In January 2011 Coulson left his post, saying coverage of the phone-hacking scandal was making it difficult to give his best to the job. In July 2011 he was arrested and questioned by police in connection with further allegations of illegal activities at the News of the World, and released on bail. Despite a call to apologise for hiring Coulson by the leader of the opposition, Cameron defended the appointment, saying that he had taken a conscious choice to give someone who had screwed up a second chance. On 20 July, in a special parliamentary session at the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_England" title="House of Commons of England">House of Commons</a>, arranged to discuss the <a href="/wiki/News_International_phone_hacking_scandal" title="News International phone hacking scandal">News International phone hacking scandal</a>, Cameron said that he &quot;regretted the furore&quot; that had resulted from his appointment of Coulson, and that &quot;with hindsight&quot; he would not have hired him. Coulson was detained and charged with perjury by <a href="/wiki/Strathclyde_Police" title="Strathclyde Police">Strathclyde Police</a> on 30 May 2012. Coulson was convicted of conspiracy to hack phones in June 2014. Prior to the jury handing down their verdict, Cameron issued a &quot;full and frank&quot; apology for hiring him, saying &quot;I am extremely sorry that I employed him. It was the wrong decision and I am very clear about that.&quot; The judge hearing Coulson&apos;s trial was critical of the prime minister, pondering whether the intervention was out of ignorance or deliberate, and demanded an explanation.</p><p>Although <a href="/wiki/Michael_Ashcroft" title="Michael Ashcroft">Lord Ashcroft</a> played a significant role in the 2010 election, he wasn&apos;t offered a ministerial post. In June 2012, shortly before a major Tory rebellion on <a href="/wiki/Reform_of_the_House_of_Lords" title="Reform of the House of Lords">House of Lords reform</a>, journalist <a href="/wiki/Peter_Oborne" title="Peter Oborne">Peter Oborne</a> credited Ashcroft with &quot;stopping the Coalition working&quot; by moving policy on Europe, welfare, education, taxation to the right. According to Oborne, Ashcroft, owner of both the <a href="/wiki/ConservativeHome" title="ConservativeHome">ConservativeHome</a> and PoliticsHome websites and a &quot;brutal critic of the Coalition from the start&quot;, had established &quot;megaphone presence&quot; in the on-line media. He believes Cameron&apos;s philosophy of liberal conservatism has been destroyed by &quot;coordinated attacks on the Coalition&quot; and &quot;the two parties are no longer trying to pretend that they are governing together.&quot;</p><p>In <i>The Observer</i>, <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Rawnsley" title="Andrew Rawnsley">Andrew Rawnsley</a> commented that he believes that Ashcroft uses carefully timed opinion polls to &quot;generate publicity&quot;, &quot;stir trouble for the prime minister&quot; and influence the direction of the party. In 2015 Ashcroft released <i><a href="/wiki/Call_Me_Dave" title="Call Me Dave">Call Me Dave</a></i>, an unauthorised biography of Cameron written with journalist <a href="/wiki/Isabel_Oakeshott" title="Isabel Oakeshott">Isabel Oakeshott</a>, which attracted significant media attention for various lurid allegations about Cameron&apos;s time at university. The book includes an anonymous anecdote about Cameron, now referred to as <a href="/wiki/Piggate" title="Piggate">Piggate</a>. No evidence for the anecdote has been produced. Many commentators have described the accusations as a &quot;revenge job&quot; by Ashcroft, who was not offered a senior role in government when Cameron came to power in 2010. Ashcroft initially claimed the book was &quot;not about settling scores&quot;, while Oakeshott said that they had held back publication until after the 2015 General Election to avoid damaging Cameron and the Conservatives&apos; electoral chances. Ashcroft subsequently admitted that the initiation allegations &quot;may have been case of mistaken identity&quot; and has stated that he has a personal &quot;beef&quot; with Cameron. Cameron later went on to deny these allegations and stated that Ashcroft&apos;s reasons for writing the book were clear and the public could see clearly through it.</p><p>In the first month of Cameron&apos;s leadership, the Conservative Party&apos;s standing in opinion polls rose, with several pollsters placing it ahead of the ruling <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a>. While the Conservative and Labour Parties drew even in early spring 2006, following the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_local_elections,_2006" title="United Kingdom local elections, 2006">May 2006 local elections</a> various polls once again generally showed Conservative leads.</p><p>When <a href="/wiki/Gordon_Brown" title="Gordon Brown">Gordon Brown</a> became <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> in June 2007, Labour moved ahead and its ratings grew steadily at Cameron&apos;s expense, an <a href="/wiki/ICM_Research" title="ICM Research">ICM</a> poll in July showing Labour with a seven-point lead. An ICM poll in September saw Cameron rated the least popular of the three main party leaders. A <a href="/wiki/YouGov" title="YouGov">YouGov</a> poll for Channel 4 one week later, after the Labour Party Conference, extended the Labour lead to 11 points, prompting further speculation of an early election.</p><p>Following the Conservative Party Conference in October 2007, the Conservatives drew level with Labour. When Brown declared he would not call an election for the autumn, a decline in his and Labour&apos;s standings followed. At the end of the year a series of polls showed improved support for the Conservatives giving them an 11-point lead over Labour. By May 2008, following the worst local election performance from the Labour Party in 40 years, the Conservative lead was up to 26 points, the largest since 1968.</p><p>In late 2009, the Conservative lead decreased and by January 2010 some polls were predicting a <a href="/wiki/Hung_parliament" title="Hung parliament">hung parliament</a>, which was the eventual result.</p><p>A <a href="/wiki/YouGov" title="YouGov">YouGov</a> poll on party leaders conducted on 9&#x2013;10 June 2011 found 44% of the electorate thought he was doing well and 50% thought he was doing badly, whilst 38% thought he would be the best PM and 35% did not know.</p><p>Until his veto on treaty changes to the European Union in December 2011 amid the Eurozone crisis, most opinion polls that year had shown a slim Labour lead. Many opinion polls showed that the majority of voters felt that Cameron made the right decision. Subsequent opinion polls have shown a narrow lead for the Conservatives ahead of Labour.</p><p>In the run up to the 2015 election, Cameron achieved his first net positive approval rating in four years, with a YouGov poll finding 47% of voters thought he was doing well as prime minister compared with 46% who thought he was doing badly.</p><p>In September 2015, a Opinium poll had similar results to the one shortly before the election, with voters split with 42% who approved of him and 41% who did not. Under their new leader <a href="/wiki/Jeremy_Corbyn" title="Jeremy Corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a>, Labour support continued to lag behind that of the Conservatives. Cameron had significantly better net approval ratings in polls conducting in December and January (getting -6 in both) than Corbyn (who got -38 and -39). However, following the <a href="/wiki/Panama_Papers" title="Panama Papers">Panama Papers</a> leak in April 2016, his personal approval ratings fell below Corbyn&apos;s.</p><p>Following the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum,_2016" title="United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016">European Union membership referendum</a> of 2016, Cameron announced his intention to resign as Prime Minister before the party&apos;s autumn conference, starting 2 October that year. Subsequently, the Party scheduled the <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)_leadership_election,_2016" title="Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2016">leadership election</a> for 9 September 2016. </p><p>Cameron has made it clear that the next Prime Minister should activate article 50 and begin negotiations with the EU. The PM was in Brussels on 28 June 2016 for his final summit with the EU and planned to address members. &quot;I&#x2019;ll be explaining that Britain will be leaving the European Union but I want that process to be as constructive as possible ...&quot;.</p><p>Cameron is married to <a href="/wiki/Samantha_Cameron" title="Samantha Cameron">Samantha Gwendoline Sheffield</a>, the daughter of <a href="/wiki/Sir_Reginald_Sheffield,_8th_Baronet" title="Sir Reginald Sheffield, 8th Baronet">Sir Reginald Sheffield, 8th Baronet</a>, and Annabel Lucy Veronica Jones (now <a href="/wiki/Annabel_Astor,_Viscountess_Astor" title="Annabel Astor, Viscountess Astor">Viscountess Astor</a>).

Recalling the receipt of this news, Cameron was quoted as saying: &quot;The news hits you like a freight train&#xA0;... You are depressed for a while because you are grieving for the difference between your hopes and the reality. But then you get over that, because he&apos;s wonderful.&quot; Ivan was cared for at the specialist NHS Cheyne Day Centre in West London, which closed shortly after he left it. Ivan died at <a href="/wiki/St_Mary%27s_Hospital,_London" title="St Mary&apos;s Hospital, London">St Mary&apos;s Hospital</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paddington" title="Paddington">Paddington</a>, London, on 25 February 2009, aged six.</p><p>The Camerons have two daughters, Nancy Gwen (born 2004) and Florence Rose Endellion (born 24 August 2010), and a son, Arthur Elwen (born 2006). Cameron took <a href="/wiki/Paternity_leave" class="mw-redirect" title="Paternity leave">paternity leave</a> when his son was born, and this decision received broad coverage. It was also stated that Cameron would be taking paternity leave after his second daughter was born. His second daughter was born on 24 August 2010, three weeks prematurely, while the family was on holiday in <a href="/wiki/Cornwall" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>. Her third given name, Endellion, is taken from the village of <a href="/wiki/St_Endellion" title="St Endellion">St Endellion</a> near where the Camerons were holidaying.</p><p>In early May 2008, the Camerons decided to enrol their daughter Nancy at a <a href="/wiki/State_school" title="State school">state</a> <a href="/wiki/Primary_school" title="Primary school">primary school</a>.

Later that day, with David and other family members at his bedside, Ian died. On 17 September 2010, Cameron attended a private ceremony for the funeral of his father in <a href="/wiki/Berkshire" title="Berkshire">Berkshire</a>, which prevented him from hearing the address of <a href="/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a> in <a href="/wiki/Westminster_Hall" class="mw-redirect" title="Westminster Hall">Westminster Hall</a>, an occasion he would otherwise have attended.</p><p>In October 2010, David Cameron inherited &#xA3;300,000 from his father&apos;s will. The Camerons&apos; family fortune was built up by his late father, Ian Cameron, who had worked as a stockbroker in <a href="/wiki/City_of_London#Economy" title="City of London">the City</a>. Ian Cameron used multimillion-pound investment funds based in offshore tax havens, such as Jersey, Panama City, and Geneva, to increase the family wealth. In 1979 he took advantage of the end of <a href="/wiki/Capital_control" title="Capital control">capital controls</a> made by Margaret Thatcher during her first month in power, which made it legal to take money out of the country without it being taxed or subject to any financial controls by the UK government. In 1982, Ian Cameron created the Panamanian Blairmore Holdings Inc. an <a href="/wiki/Offshore_investment" title="Offshore investment">offshore investment</a> fund, valued at about $20 million in 1988, &quot;not liable to taxation on its income or capital gains&quot;, which used <a href="/wiki/Bearer_share" class="mw-redirect" title="Bearer share">bearer shares</a> until 2006.</p><p>In April 2016, following the <a href="/wiki/Panama_Papers" title="Panama Papers">Panama Papers</a> financial documents leak, David Cameron faced calls to resign after he was forced to admit that he and his wife Samantha profited from Ian Cameron&apos;s offshore fund. He owned &#xA3;31,500 of shares in the fund and sold them for a profit of &#xA3;19,000 shortly before becoming Prime Minister in 2010. The former Mayor of London, <a href="/wiki/Ken_Livingstone" title="Ken Livingstone">Ken Livingstone</a>, even argued that Cameron &quot;shouldn&apos;t just resign, he should be sent to prison&quot;. David Cameron argued that the fund was set up in Panama so that people who wanted to invest in dollar-denominated shares and companies could do so. Cameron had personally intervened in 2013 to water down a planned EU crackdown on tax evasion.</p><p>Thousands of protesters assembled in London on 9 April 2016 to demand Cameron&apos;s resignation.

In early 2006, he was photographed cycling to work, followed by his driver in a car carrying his belongings. His Conservative Party spokesperson subsequently said that this was a regular arrangement for Cameron at the time.
