On March 13, Love&apos;s consecutive double-double streak ended at 53 games in a loss to the <a href="/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors" title="Golden State Warriors">Golden State Warriors</a>.

Love was two short of <a href="/wiki/Elvin_Hayes" title="Elvin Hayes">Elvin Hayes</a>&apos;s streak of 55 consecutive double-doubles set in the 1973&#x2013;74 season. According to the <a href="/wiki/Elias_Sports_Bureau" title="Elias Sports Bureau">Elias Sports Bureau</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wilt_Chamberlain" title="Wilt Chamberlain">Wilt Chamberlain</a> holds the record with 227 consecutive double-doubles from 1964 to 1967. The NBA does not recognize the double-double as an official statistic. Love suffered a strained left groin on March 20 against Sacramento.

He emerged as the new face of the franchise since Garnett was traded from the Timberwolves to the <a href="/wiki/Boston_Celtics" title="Boston Celtics">Boston Celtics</a> in 2007. In 2010&#x2013;11, Love&apos;s No. 42 was the Wolves&apos; top-selling jersey; sales were comparable to <a href="/wiki/Kevin_Garnett" title="Kevin Garnett">Kevin Garnett</a>&apos;s when he was in his prime.</p><p>This was Love&apos;s contract season. He had stated that he wanted to be the Timberwolves&apos; &quot;<a href="/wiki/Designated_player_(NBA)" class="mw-redirect" title="Designated player (NBA)">designated player</a>&quot; for a five-year deal  during the offseason (a designated player offer must be made prior to the final year qualifying offer), but he was denied this contract by the Timberwolves. Contract negotiations became tense, leading to an incident where David Kahn (team GM) &quot;marched&quot; into the players training room and &quot;thrust [...] a contract offer sheet into his hands&quot;. Love responded, &quot;I&apos;m not the one to always follow professional protocol &#x2013; but I do know what it is, even at 24 years old&quot;. They eventually settled on four years with a player option for Love to opt out after the third year. The four-year contract extension worth up to $62&#xA0;million was finally agreed to, and signed, on January 25, allowing Love to become an unrestricted free agent as early as 2015. Love has stated that he felt very strongly that he should have had a five-year designated player extension, and would have accepted the offer, had it been offered to him.</p><p>Love followed up this new contract extension the subsequent night with a 31-point performance in a win over the <a href="/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks" title="Dallas Mavericks">Dallas Mavericks</a>. In January 2012, Love scored 30 points in three consecutive games for the first time in his career.

After the game on February 4, Love said, &quot;I mean, he fell down after the play. He just kind of laid there and... I just happened to be there. I had nowhere to go. I got kind of tripped up and I just had nowhere to step. He was right there... and it happened to be his face.&#x201D; On February 25, 2012, Love participated in the <a href="/wiki/Three-Point_Shootout" class="mw-redirect" title="Three-Point Shootout">Three-Point Shootout</a> and defeated <a href="/wiki/Kevin_Durant" title="Kevin Durant">Kevin Durant</a> in the final tie-breaking round to win the contest.

For the season, Love was named to the <a href="/wiki/All-NBA" class="mw-redirect" title="All-NBA">All-NBA</a> second team and finished sixth in MVP voting. In the offseason, Love voiced frustration with Minnesota for not being a playoff team. The Timberwolves finished with the <a href="/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)" title="Western Conference (NBA)">Western Conference</a>&apos;s fourth-worst record at 26&#x2013;40, which was still the franchise&apos;s most wins since the <a href="/wiki/2006%E2%80%9307_Minnesota_Timberwolves_season" title="2006&#x2013;07 Minnesota Timberwolves season">2006&#x2013;07 season</a>.</p><p>On October 17, 2012, it was reported that Love would miss six to eight weeks after breaking the third and fourth <a href="/wiki/Metacarpal" class="mw-redirect" title="Metacarpal">metacarpals</a> on his right (shooting) hand during a morning workout. Love surprised fans by returning to the Wolves on November 21, just five weeks after sustaining the injury. He played 35 minutes and scored 34 points while grabbing 14 rebounds against the <a href="/wiki/Denver_Nuggets" title="Denver Nuggets">Denver Nuggets</a>.

It was announced by the Timberwolves that Love&apos;s injury would require surgery and he is expected to miss an additional eight to ten weeks of playing time. Prior to the second fracture, Love was shooting just 21.7 percent on three-pointers and a career-low 35 percent from the field, leading some to speculate that he had returned too quickly from his original injury. Love himself admitted that the hand remained an issue throughout the season, saying &quot;It&apos;s just the hand being so idle, having to strengthen it. Getting the ball to feel right in my hand has been such a struggle since getting back on the court a couple weeks ago.&quot; </p><p>On February 22, 2014, Love recorded his first career triple double with 37 points, 12 rebounds and a career-high 10 assists in a 121-104 win over the Utah Jazz. On March 9, Love, with a 3-pointer midway through the third quarter of Minnesota&#x2019;s 104-111 loss to the Raptors, broke the Timberwolves&#x2019; franchise record for 3-pointers in a season.
