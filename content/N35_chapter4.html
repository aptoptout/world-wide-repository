<p>Sir Robert Bryson Hall II was born on January 22, 1990, in <a href="/wiki/Gaithersburg" class="mw-redirect" title="Gaithersburg">Gaithersburg</a>, <a href="/wiki/Maryland" title="Maryland">Maryland</a> to Robert Bryson Hall, an <a href="/wiki/African-American" class="mw-redirect" title="African-American">African-American</a> Maryland native, and a <a href="/wiki/White_American" class="mw-redirect" title="White American">Caucasian</a> mother. Logic spent much of his youth in a collection of public housing projects in West Deer Park, a low-income crime-ridden neighborhood, and, throughout his childhood, both his parents suffered from cocaine addiction and alcoholism. Despite his father initially being absent in his childhood, Logic was able to reconnect with Hall due to his burgeoning rap career. During his early adolescent years, Logic witnessed his brothers produce and distribute <a href="/wiki/Crack_cocaine" title="Crack cocaine">crack cocaine</a> to &quot;addicts all over the block,&quot; as well as seeing his siblings sell the drug to his father. Logic maintains that he accurately knows how to manufacture and produce crack cocaine following these experiences. He attended neighboring <a href="/wiki/Gaithersburg_High_School" title="Gaithersburg High School">Gaithersburg High School</a>, however, he did not graduate and was soon expelled after he began skipping classes in the 10th grade. &quot;I started doing badly and failed every class but <a href="/wiki/English_studies" title="English studies">English</a>, so they kicked me out of school, they gave up on me.&quot; After leaving school at 16, Logic decided to actively pursue a musical career.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2005.E2.80.9312:_Early_career_and_various_mixtapes">2005&#x2013;12: Early career and various mixtapes</span></h3>
<p>At the age of 13, Logic met Solomon Taylor, who would soon become his mentor following Logic&apos;s expulsion from school. Logic first became interested in rap and hip hop after watching the movie <i><a href="/wiki/Kill_Bill:_Volume_1" title="Kill Bill: Volume 1">Kill Bill: Volume 1</a></i>, directed by <a href="/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino" title="Quentin Tarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a>, that same year. The film&apos;s score was completed by <a href="/wiki/RZA" title="RZA">RZA</a> of <a href="/wiki/Wu-Tang_Clan" title="Wu-Tang Clan">Wu-Tang Clan</a>. Following this, Logic began listening to Wu-Tang Clan, and soon expressed a deep affection for hip hop. Logic bought <a href="/wiki/The_Roots" title="The Roots">The Roots</a> album <i><a href="/wiki/Do_You_Want_More%3F!!!%3F%3F!" title="Do You Want More?!!!??!">Do You Want More?!!!??!</a></i>, later that year, which prompted Taylor to bring Logic a large number of CD&apos;s containing instrumental beats, for him to write lyrics over. In 2009, Logic performed under the sobriquet &quot;Psychological&quot;, with Logic describing the name as: &quot;One name that really stuck was Psychological. I just loved this word because it was about the mind and I knew that&apos;s what I wanted my music to consist of; something that really challenges the mind.&quot; He released an unofficial mixtape titled <i>Psychological &#x2013; Logic: The Mixtape</i> under his original stage name. The mixtape allowed Logic to serve as the <a href="/wiki/Opening_act" title="Opening act">opening act</a> for artists like <a href="/wiki/Pitbull_(entertainer)" class="mw-redirect" title="Pitbull (entertainer)">Pitbull</a>, <a href="/wiki/EPMD" title="EPMD">EPMD</a>, <a href="/wiki/Method_Man" title="Method Man">Method Man</a>, <a href="/wiki/Redman_(rapper)" title="Redman (rapper)">Redman</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ludacris" title="Ludacris">Ludacris</a> at various shows all over Maryland. Soon after, he shortened the &quot;Psychological&quot; moniker to &quot;<a href="/wiki/Logic" title="Logic">Logic</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>Following these introductory experiences, Logic released his first official mixtape, <i><a href="/wiki/Young,_Broke_%26_Infamous" title="Young, Broke &amp; Infamous">Young, Broke &amp; Infamous</a></i>, on December 27, 2010. The mixtape was well received by critics and allowed Logic to establish an early following. Chris Zarou, the president of Visionary Music Group, heard the mixtape and signed Logic to the independent label. Upon signing, Logic stated in an interview, &quot;Visionary Music Group is like Roc-A-Fella. <a href="/wiki/Damon_Dash" title="Damon Dash">Damon Dash</a>, that&apos;s like Chris Zarou of Visionary Music Group, I like to see myself as a <a href="/wiki/Jay_Z" title="Jay Z">Jay</a>. In no way am I arrogant or cocky, I have to see it in order to do it. They did it independent and when they signed with a major, they did it the way that they wanted to do it.&quot; The mixtape was then confirmed to have been downloaded over 250,000 times on online mixtape sharing platform <a href="/wiki/DatPiff" title="DatPiff">DatPiff</a>. Soon after, Logic released his second mixtape <i><a href="/wiki/Young_Sinatra_(mixtape)" title="Young Sinatra (mixtape)">Young Sinatra</a></i>. It serves as the first installment in the <i>Young Sinatra</i> chronology, and the mixtape received critical acclaim from various publications, including <a href="/wiki/XXL_(magazine)" title="XXL (magazine)">XXL</a>. The music video for &quot;All I Do&quot;, released to <a href="/wiki/YouTube" title="YouTube">YouTube</a>, gained over a million views in the week following its release.</p>
<p>After the success of his previous two projects, Logic released his third mixtape <i><a href="/wiki/Young_Sinatra:_Undeniable" title="Young Sinatra: Undeniable">Young Sinatra: Undeniable</a></i> on April 30, 2012. The mixtape is notable for Logic addressing various personal topics, including his future, his father&apos;s drug use, his aforementioned expulsion from school, and his mother getting stabbed. Speaking about the mixtape, Logic said, &quot;Fans tend to think that if you fall in love with an artist because he makes this kind of sound and then he gets bigger and he grows and he starts to make a different sound, &apos;He&apos;s changing on us.&apos; But with me, I created all types of sounds from the get go, so you can never say I&apos;m changing, you can never say I&apos;m going mainstream or I&apos;m selling out.&quot; He commented on the musical aspects of the mixtape, stating, &quot;There&apos;s stuff on there for the motherfuckers that don&apos;t pay attention to lyrics and just want to have fun, but every line is constructed with such depth that the real lyricists and nitpickers have something to listen to and analyze.&quot; After the release of <i>Young Sinatra: Undeniable</i>, Logic completed his first national headlining tour, the Visionary Music Group Tour, alongside then-label-mate Tayyib Ali.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Personal_life">Personal life</span></h2>
<p>In order to properly delve into music as a full-time occupation, Logic terminated a five-year romantic relationship in 2009. He had then stated, &quot;You can put your everything into a relationship, but that doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;re going to get back what you give. When I created my first mixtape, I realized everything I put in my music &#x2014; the hours, the lyricism, the time, the grind, pain, sweat, blood, tears &#x2014; I get it back. I see it.&quot; He would then further comment, saying &quot;The thing is, I feel like so many artists, well, not really artists but so many people think they can rap and they just want a deal and the glitz and the glamour and the women but they don&apos;t understand that all I do and want to do is rhyme... I think I&apos;ve sacrificed so much from my relationships to my friendships to my family; I&apos;ve literally sacrificed my entire life and I&apos;m honest.&quot; In October 2015, Logic married Jessica Andrea, a singer and Logic&apos;s then girlfriend of two years.</p>
<p>Logic has referred to himself as a huge <a href="/wiki/Cannabis_smoking" title="Cannabis smoking">pothead</a> when he was growing up. He has said that, &quot;I don&#x2019;t drink; I don&#x2019;t smoke weed. I used to smoke; I used to be a pretty big pothead when I was younger, but I don&#x2019;t smoke. I might have an occasional glass of champagne.&quot; Logic, however, had a serious nicotine addiction, dedicating the song, &quot;Nikki&quot;, from <i><a href="/wiki/Under_Pressure_(album)" title="Under Pressure (album)">Under Pressure</a></i> to talk about the subject. He talks about smoking since he was 13, and that when giving up marijuana and alcohol, he could not muster the courage to give up nicotine. He, however, pledged to not smoke another cigarette concluding the release of <i>Under Pressure</i>.</p>

<p>Despite being a hip-hop artist, Logic is heavily influenced by <a href="/wiki/Frank_Sinatra" title="Frank Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>.
