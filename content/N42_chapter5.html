At Kew-Forest, Fred Trump served as a member of the Board of Trustees. Due to behavior problems, Trump left the school at age 13 and was enrolled in the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Military_Academy" title="New York Military Academy">New York Military Academy</a> (NYMA). In 1983, Fred told an interviewer that Donald &quot;was a pretty rough fellow when he was small&quot;. Trump finished eighth grade and high school at NYMA. During his senior year, Trump participated in marching drills and wore a uniform, attaining the rank of <a href="/wiki/Captain" title="Captain">captain</a>.

While there, he worked at the family&apos;s company, Elizabeth Trump &amp; Son, named for <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Christ_Trump" title="Elizabeth Christ Trump">his paternal grandmother</a>.

While in college, he obtained four student deferments. He was deemed fit for service based upon a military medical examination in 1966, and was briefly classified as fit by a local draft board in 1968, but was then medically disqualified later in 1968. Trump has attributed his medical deferment to &quot;<a href="/wiki/Calcaneal_spur" title="Calcaneal spur">heel spurs</a>&quot; in both feet according to a 2015 biography. <a href="/wiki/Selective_Service_System" title="Selective Service System">Selective Service</a> records from the <a href="/wiki/National_Archives_and_Records_Administration" title="National Archives and Records Administration">National Archives</a> confirm that Trump received the medical deferment and eventually received a high selective service lottery number in 1969. Trump explained: &quot;I actually got lucky because I had a very high draft number.&quot;</p><p>Prior to graduating from college, Trump began his real estate career at his father&apos;s company, Elizabeth Trump and Son, which focused on middle-class rental housing in the New York City <a href="/wiki/Borough_(New_York_City)" title="Borough (New York City)">boroughs</a> of <a href="/wiki/Brooklyn" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Queens" title="Queens">Queens</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Staten_Island" title="Staten Island">Staten Island</a>. During his <a href="/wiki/Undergraduate_education" title="Undergraduate education">undergraduate study</a>, one of Trump&apos;s first projects had been the revitalization of the foreclosed Swifton Village apartment complex in <a href="/wiki/Cincinnati" title="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ohio" title="Ohio">Ohio</a>, which his father had purchased for $5.7&#xA0;million in 1962. Fred and Donald Trump became involved in the project and, with a $500,000 investment, turned the 1,200-unit complex&apos;s occupancy rate from 34% to 100%. Trump has said that when he graduated from college in 1968, he was worth about US$200,000 (equivalent to $1,021,000 in 2015). In 1972, The Trump Organization sold Swifton Village for $6.75&#xA0;million. At age 23, he made an unsuccessful commercial foray into show business, investing $70,000 to become co-producer of the 1970 Broadway comedy <i>Paris Is Out!</i>.</p><p>In 1971, Trump moved to <a href="/wiki/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, where he became involved in larger construction projects, and used attractive <a href="/wiki/Architectural_design" class="mw-redirect" title="Architectural design">architectural design</a> to win public recognition. Trump initially came to public attention in 1973 when the Trump Organization was accused by the <a href="/wiki/Justice_Department_(United_States)" class="mw-redirect" title="Justice Department (United States)">Justice Department</a> of violations of the <a href="/wiki/Fair_Housing_Act" title="Fair Housing Act">Fair Housing Act</a> in the operation of 39 buildings. After an unsuccessful countersuit filed by attorney <a href="/wiki/Roy_Cohn" title="Roy Cohn">Roy Cohn</a>, Trump settled the charges in 1975 without admitting guilt, saying he was satisfied that the agreement did not &quot;compel the Trump Organization to accept persons on welfare as tenants unless as qualified as any other tenant.&quot; Several years later the Trump Organization was again in court for violating terms of the settlement; Trump denied the charges and there is no indication that he was found guilty.</p><p>By 1973, Trump was president of the Trump Organization and oversaw the company&apos;s 14,000 apartments across Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. Trump promoted Penn Central&apos;s rail yard on <a href="/wiki/30th_Street_(Manhattan)" class="mw-redirect" title="30th Street (Manhattan)">30th Street</a> as a site for New York City&apos;s planned <a href="/wiki/Jacob_K._Javits_Convention_Center" title="Jacob K. Javits Convention Center">Jacob K. Javits Convention Center</a> in 1975. He estimated his company could have completed the project for $110&#xA0;million, but, while the city chose his site, it rejected his offer and Trump received a broker&apos;s fee on the sale of the property instead.</p><p>Trump&apos;s first big deal in Manhattan was the building of the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Hyatt_Hotel" class="mw-redirect" title="Grand Hyatt Hotel">Grand Hyatt Hotel</a> in 1978 near Grand Central Station. The Grand Hyatt would replace the aging Commodore Hotel, owned by the <a href="/wiki/Penn_Central_Transportation_Company" title="Penn Central Transportation Company">Penn Central Transportation Company</a> which was in bankruptcy, and help bring Trump to public prominence. Part of this deal was a $1 million loan that Donald&apos;s father Fred&apos;s Village Construction Corp. made to help repay draws on a Chase Manhattan credit line that Fred had arranged for Trump as he built the hotel, as well as a $70 million construction loan which was jointly guaranteed by Fred and the Hyatt hotel chain. Fred Trump was a silent partner in the initiative, due to his reputation having been damaged in New York real estate circles after investigations into windfall profits and other abuses in his real estate projects, making Trump the front man in the deal. According to journalist Wayne Barrett, Fred&apos;s two-decade friendship with a top Equitable officer, Ben Holloway, helped convince them to agree to the project. Donald negotiated a forty-year tax abatement for the hotel with the city in exchange for a share of the venture&apos;s profits. The deal helped reduce the risk of the project and provided an incentive for investors to participate.</p><p>In 1981, Trump purchased and renovated a building that would become the Trump Plaza. The Plaza later became the home of Dick Clark and Martina Navratilova.</p><p>In 1983, Trump completed development of the <a href="/wiki/Trump_Tower_(New_York_City)" title="Trump Tower (New York City)">Trump Tower</a>. The project involved complicated negotiations with different parties for the Bonwit Teller building itself, the land, and the airspace above a neighboring building. When negotiations were completed in 1978, the <i>New York Times</i> wrote &quot;That Mr. Trump was able to obtain the location... is testimony to [his] persistence and to his skills as a negotiator.&quot; Favorable reviews of the building&apos;s design helped convince the city to approve the project. Trump hired Barbara Res to manage the building&apos;s construction, and she became the first woman to manage the construction of a skyscraper in New York City.</p><p>Trump Tower occupies the former site of the architecturally significant <a href="/wiki/Bonwit_Teller" title="Bonwit Teller">Bonwit Teller</a> <a href="/wiki/Flagship_store" class="mw-redirect" title="Flagship store">flagship store</a>, demolished in 1980.

In addition, the demolition of the Bonwit Teller store was criticized for a contractor&apos;s use of some 200 undocumented Polish immigrant workers, who, during the rushed demolition process, were reportedly paid 4&#x2013;5 dollars per hour for work in 12-hour shifts. Trump testified in 1990 that he rarely visited the site and was unaware of the illegal workers, some of whom lived at the site and who were known as the &quot;Polish Brigade&quot;. A judge ruled in 1991 that the builders engaged in &quot;a conspiracy to deprive the funds of their rightful contribution&quot;, referring to the pension and welfare funds of the labor unions. However, on appeal, parts of that ruling were overturned, and the record became sealed when the long-running labor lawsuit was settled in 1999, after 16 years in court.</p><p>Trump Tower, a 58-story, mixed-use <a href="/wiki/Skyscraper" title="Skyscraper">skyscraper</a> on <a href="/wiki/Fifth_Avenue_(Manhattan)" class="mw-redirect" title="Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)">Fifth Avenue</a> in <a href="/wiki/Midtown_Manhattan" title="Midtown Manhattan">Midtown Manhattan</a>, was developed by Trump and the <a href="/wiki/The_Equitable_Life_Assurance_Society_of_the_United_States" class="mw-redirect" title="The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States">Equitable Life Assurance Company</a>, and was designed by architect <a href="/wiki/Der_Scutt" title="Der Scutt">Der Scutt</a> of <a href="/wiki/Swanke_Hayden_Connell_Architects" title="Swanke Hayden Connell Architects">Swanke Hayden Connell</a>.

When the building was completed, its condominiums sold quickly and the tower became a tourist attraction.</p><p>Harrah&apos;s at Trump Plaza opened in Atlantic City in 1984. The hotel/casino was built by Trump with financing by <a href="/wiki/Holiday_Inn" title="Holiday Inn">Holiday Inn</a>. Trump also acquired a partially completed building in Atlantic City from the Hilton Corporation for $320 million. When completed in 1985, the hotel/casino became Trump Castle.

In addition to using the home as a winter retreat, Trump also turned it into a private club with membership fees of $150,000. At about the same time, he acquired a condominium complex in Palm Beach with <a href="/wiki/Lee_Iacocca" title="Lee Iacocca">Lee Iacocca</a> which became Trump Plaza of the Palm Beaches.</p><p>Repairs on the <a href="/wiki/Wollman_Rink" title="Wollman Rink">Wollman Rink</a> in <a href="/wiki/Central_Park" title="Central Park">Central Park</a>, built in 1955, were started in 1980 by a <a href="/wiki/General_contractor" title="General contractor">general contractor</a> unconnected to Trump, with an expected <span class="frac nowrap">2<span class="visualhide">&#xA0;</span>&#x2044;<sub>2</sub></span>-year construction schedule, but were not completed by 1986. Trump took over the project, completed it in three months for $1.95&#xA0;million, which was $750,000 less than the initial budget, and then operated the rink for one year with all profits going to charity.</p><p>Trump acquired the <a href="/wiki/Plaza_Hotel" title="Plaza Hotel">Plaza Hotel</a> on New York City&apos;s Central Park South in Manhattan in 1988.

The Taj Mahal emerged from bankruptcy on October 5, 1991, with Trump ceding 50&#xA0;percent ownership in the casino to the bondholders in exchange for lowered interest rates and more time to pay off the debt. He also sold his financially challenged <a href="/wiki/Trump_Shuttle" title="Trump Shuttle">Trump Shuttle</a> airline and his 282-foot <a href="/wiki/Luxury_yacht" title="Luxury yacht">megayacht</a>, the <i><a href="/wiki/Kingdom_5KR" title="Kingdom 5KR">Trump Princess</a></i>.

The restructuring ultimately left Trump with 10% ownership in the Trump Taj Mahal and other Trump casino properties. Trump served as chairman of the organization, which was renamed Trump Entertainment Resorts, from mid-1995 until early 2009, and served as CEO from mid-2000 to mid-2005.</p><p>Its sister property, <a href="/wiki/Trump_Plaza_Hotel_and_Casino" title="Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino">Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino</a>, closed in September 2014. In November 2014, the Trump Taj Mahal threatened to close and cease casino and hotel operations by the end of the year if the union would not drop its appeal of the casino&apos;s bankruptcy ruling, rebuffing their demand for continued health insurance and pension coverage. On December 18, 2014 the Trump Taj Mahal reached an agreement with its union and kept the casino open, but did not restore the contested benefits. In February 2016, the Trump Taj Mahal and Trump Entertainment Resorts were purchased by billionaire <a href="/wiki/Carl_Icahn" title="Carl Icahn">Carl Icahn</a> and exited Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</p><p>The late 1990s saw a resurgence in Trump&apos;s financial situation. The will of Trump&apos;s father, who died in 1999, divided an estate estimated at $250&#x2013;300&#xA0;million equally among his four surviving children.</p><p>Trump acquired an old, vacant office building on Wall Street in Manhattan in 1996.

His disclosure filings for the year 2015 revealed that his total gross revenue was in excess of $611 million. According to <i><a href="/wiki/Fortune_(magazine)" title="Fortune (magazine)">Fortune</a></i> magazine, the $362 million figure as stated on his FEC filings is not &quot;income&quot; but gross revenue before salaries, interest payments on outstanding debt, and other business-related expenses; Trump&apos;s net income was &quot;most likely&quot; about one-third of that. According to public records, Trump received a $302 New York tax rebate in 2013 (and in two other recent years) given to couples earning less than $500,000 per year, who submit as proof their federal tax returns. Trump&apos;s campaign manager has suggested that Trump&apos;s tax rebate was an error.

They&#x2019;re bringing drugs. They&#x2019;re bringing crime. They&#x2019;re rapists.

Trump disputes this valuation, saying that his brand is worth about $3&#xA0;billion. Many developers pay Trump to market their properties and to be the public face for their projects. For that reason, Trump does not own many of the buildings that display his name. According to <i>Forbes</i>, this portion of Trump&apos;s empire, actually run by his children, is by far his most valuable, having a $562&#xA0;million valuation. According to <i>Forbes</i>, there are 33 licensing projects under development including seven &quot;condo hotels&quot; (the seven Trump International Hotel and Tower developments).

In 2011, Trump made a rare foray into the stock market after being disappointed with the depressed American real estate market and facing poor returns on <a href="/wiki/Certificate_of_deposit" title="Certificate of deposit">bank deposits</a>.

Trump responded by disclosing the existence of the ongoing audit. Trump later said that the government has audited him too many times, and he speculated about possible reasons for auditing him again now, saying that perhaps it was because he is a &quot;strong Christian&quot;, though he added &quot;I don&apos;t think it applies&quot;. Trump says he will not yet release records for audited years that he had &quot;passed&quot; because such records &quot;mesh&quot; and &quot;interrelate&quot; with current disputed IRS filings. Tax attorneys are generally sympathetic to wanting tax returns kept private until an audit is completed. High income individuals are audited more frequently than the average taxpayer, but it is unusual for an individual to be audited for several consecutive years. When asked by journalist <a href="/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos" title="George Stephanopoulos">George Stephanopoulos</a> if he would reveal his tax rate, Trump replied: &quot;It&apos;s none of your business, you&apos;ll see it when I release.

These estimates would make Trump one of the <a href="/wiki/List_of_richest_American_politicians" title="List of richest American politicians">richest politicians in American history</a>. As of March 2016, <i>Forbes</i> had him listed at #336 on its list of the world&apos;s most wealthy.</p><p>Trump was listed on the initial Forbes List of wealthy individuals in 1982 as having an estimated $200 million fortune, including a share of his father&apos;s estimated $200 million net worth. After several years on the list, Trump&apos;s financial indiscipline in the 1980s caused him to be dropped from 1990 to 1995, and reportedly obliged him to borrow from his siblings&apos; trusts in 1993; in 2005, <i>The New York Times</i> referred to Trump&apos;s &quot;verbal billions&quot; in a skeptical article about Trump&apos;s self-reported wealth. At the time, three individuals with direct knowledge of Trump&apos;s finances told reporter <a href="/wiki/Timothy_L._O%27Brien" title="Timothy L. O&apos;Brien">Timothy L. O&apos;Brien</a> that Trump&apos;s actual net worth was between $150 and $250 million, though Trump then publicly claimed a net worth of $5 to $6 billion. Claiming libel, Trump sued the reporter (and his book publisher) for $5 billion, lost the case, and then lost again on appeal; Trump refused to turn over his unredacted tax returns despite his assertion they supported his case. In a sworn deposition, Trump testified that he once borrowed $9.6 million from his father, calling it &quot;a very small amount of money&quot;, but could not recall when he did so; Trump has since told campaign audiences he began his career with &quot;a small loan of one million dollars&quot; from his father, which he paid back with interest: &quot;it has not been easy for me&quot;, Trump told one New Hampshire crowd.</p><p>In April 2011, amidst speculation whether Trump would run as a candidate in the U.S. presidential election of 2012, <a href="/wiki/Politico" title="Politico">Politico</a> quoted unnamed sources close to him stating that, if Trump should decide to run for president, he would file &quot;financial disclosure statements that [would] show his net worth [was] in excess of $7 billion with more than $250 million of cash, and very little debt.&quot; Although Trump did not run as a candidate in the 2012 elections, his &quot;professionally prepared&quot; 2012 financial disclosure was published in his book which claimed a $7 billion net worth.</p><p>Estimates of Trump&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Net_worth" title="Net worth">net worth</a> have fluctuated along with real estate valuations: in 2015, <i>Forbes</i> pegged it as $4 billion, while the Bloomberg Billionaires Index (which scrutinized Trump&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission" title="Federal Election Commission">FEC</a> filings) estimated a net worth of $2.9 billion. On June 16, 2015, just prior to announcing his candidacy for president of the United States, Trump released to the media a one-page prepared financial disclosure statement &quot;from a big accounting firm&#x2014;one of the most respected&quot; stating a net worth of $8,737,540,000. &quot;I&apos;m really rich&quot;, Trump said. <i>Forbes</i> called the nearly $9 billion figure a &quot;100%&quot; exaggeration. In June 2015, <i><a href="/wiki/Business_Insider" title="Business Insider">Business Insider</a></i> published Trump&apos;s June 2014 financial statement, noting that $3.3 billion of that total is represented by &quot;Real Estate Licensing Deals, Brand and Branded Developments&quot;, described by <i>Business Insider</i> as &quot;basically [implying] that Trump values his character at $3.3 billion.&quot; In July 2015, Federal election regulators released new details of Trump&apos;s self-reported wealth and financial holdings when he became a Republican presidential candidate, reporting that his assets are worth above $1.4 billion, which includes at least $70 million in stocks, and a debt of at least $265 million. Mortgages on Trump&apos;s major properties&#x2014;including Trump Tower, <a href="/wiki/40_Wall_Street" class="mw-redirect" title="40 Wall Street">40 Wall Street</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Trump_National_Doral_Miami" title="Trump National Doral Miami">Trump National Doral</a> golf course&#x2014;each fall into the &quot;above $50 million&quot; range, the highest reportable category on FEC filings, with Trump paying interest rates ranging from 4% to 7.125%. (Mortgages on those three properties were separately reported as $100 million, $160 million, and $125 million in 2013.) Other outstanding Trump mortgages and debts are pegged to current market interest rates. A 2012 report from Trump&apos;s accounting firm estimated $451.7 million in debt and other collateral obligations. Filings in 2015 revealed debt of $504 million, according to <i>Fortune</i> magazine.</p><p>A July 2015 campaign press release, issued one month after Trump announced his presidential run, said that the FEC filing &quot;was not designed for a man of Mr. Trump&apos;s massive wealth&quot; and that his &quot;net worth is in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS [<i><a href="/wiki/Sic" title="Sic">sic</a></i>]&quot;. However, Trump has testified that &quot;my net worth fluctuates, and it goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings&#x2014;even my own feelings.&quot; On the same day, Trump&apos;s own stated estimates of his net worth have varied by as much as $3.3 billion. Trump has also acknowledged that past exaggerated estimates of his wealth have been &quot;good for financing&quot;. <i>Forbes</i> has said that although Trump &quot;shares a lot of information with us that helps us get to the figures we publish,&quot; he &quot;consistently pushes for a higher net worth&#x2014;especially when it comes to the value of his personal brand.&quot; <i>Forbes</i> reduced its estimate of Trump&apos;s net worth by $125 million following Trump&apos;s controversial 2015 remarks about Mexican illegal immigrants, which ended Trump&apos;s business contracts with <a href="/wiki/NBCUniversal" title="NBCUniversal">NBCUniversal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Univision" title="Univision">Univision</a>, <a href="/wiki/Macy%27s" title="Macy&apos;s">Macy&apos;s</a>, <a href="/wiki/Serta_(company)" title="Serta (company)">Serta</a>, <a href="/wiki/PVH_(company)" title="PVH (company)">PVH Corporation</a>, and Perfumania.

Although his party affiliation prior to 1987 is unclear, Trump was an early supporter of Republican <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> for U.S. President in the late 70s. In 1987 he registered as a Republican until 1999. He then switched to the <a href="/wiki/Reform_Party_of_the_United_States_of_America" title="Reform Party of the United States of America">Reform Party</a> for three years and ran a <a href="/wiki/Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign,_2000" title="Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2000">presidential exploratory campaign</a> for its nomination.

From 2001 to 2009 he was a Democrat and then switched back to the Republican Party in 2009 after endorsing Republican <a href="/wiki/John_McCain" title="John McCain">John McCain</a> for President. In December 2011, Trump became an Independent for five months, before returning to the Republican Party, where he has pledged to stay.</p><p>Trump has made contributions to campaigns of both Republican Party and Democratic Party candidates, with the top ten recipients of his political contributions being six Democrats and four Republicans. After 2011, his campaign contributions were more favorable to Republicans than to Democrats. In February 2012, Trump endorsed Republican <a href="/wiki/Mitt_Romney" title="Mitt Romney">Mitt Romney</a> for President. When asked in 2015 which recent President he prefers, Trump picked Democrat <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> over the Republican <a href="/wiki/Bush_family#President" title="Bush family">Bushes</a>.</p><p>Trump floated the idea of running for president in 1988, 2004, and 2012, and for <a href="/wiki/Governor_of_New_York" title="Governor of New York">Governor of New York</a> in 2006 and 2014, but did not enter those races. He was considered as a potential running mate for George H. W. Bush on the Republican Party&apos;s 1988 presidential ticket but lost out to future Vice President <a href="/wiki/Dan_Quayle" title="Dan Quayle">Dan Quayle</a>. There is dispute over whether Trump or the Bush camp made the initial pitch.</p><p>In 1999, Trump filed an <a href="/wiki/Exploratory_committee" title="Exploratory committee">exploratory committee</a> to seek the presidential nomination of the <a href="/wiki/Reform_Party_of_the_United_States_of_America" title="Reform Party of the United States of America">Reform Party</a> in 2000.

A <i>Newsweek</i> poll conducted in February 2011 showed Trump within a few points of Barack Obama, with many voters undecided in the November 2012 general election for president of the United States. A poll released in April 2011 by <a href="/wiki/Public_Policy_Polling" title="Public Policy Polling">Public Policy Polling</a> showed Trump having a nine-point lead in a potential contest for the Republican nomination for president while he was still actively considering a run. His moves were interpreted by some media as possible promotional tools for his reality show <i>The Apprentice</i>.</p><p>In April 2011, Trump waded into the controversy about President <a href="/wiki/Barack_Obama" title="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a>&apos;s proof of <a href="/wiki/Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories" title="Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories">eligibility as a natural born citizen</a>: &quot;His grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya and she was there and witnessed the birth, okay?&quot; Trump&apos;s claim was based upon an incomplete transcript filed years earlier in a court case. Trump also questioned whether Obama&apos;s grades alone warranted entry to his <a href="/wiki/Ivy_League" title="Ivy League">Ivy League</a> schools, and called for release of school records, plus release of a long form birth certificate. Two days later, the <a href="/wiki/White_House" title="White House">White House</a> sought to put the longstanding matter to rest with release of the long form. Trump said he hoped it &quot;checks out&quot;, and expressed pride about his role. When asked years later where Obama was born, Trump said: &quot;I really don&apos;t know. I mean, I don&apos;t know why he wouldn&apos;t release his records. But you know, honestly, I don&apos;t want to get into it&quot;.</p><p>Trump&#x2019;s strengths as a potential candidate in the 2012 presidential election included being a businessman, not being a politician, not talking like a politician, and not thinking like a politician. He generally had polled at or below 17 percent among the crowded field of possible Republican candidates. On May 16, 2011, Trump announced he would not run for president in the 2012 election, while also saying he would have won.</p><p>In 2013, Trump was a featured speaker at the <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Political_Action_Conference" title="Conservative Political Action Conference">Conservative Political Action Conference</a> (CPAC). During the lightly-attended early-morning speech, Trump said that President Obama gets &quot;unprecedented media protection&quot;, he spoke against illegal immigration, and advised against harming Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.</p><p>Also in 2013, he spent over $1 million to research a possible run for president of the United States. In October 2013, New York Republicans circulated a memo suggesting Trump should run for governor of the state in 2014, against <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Cuomo" title="Andrew Cuomo">Andrew Cuomo</a>; Trump said in response that while New York had problems and taxes were too high, running for governor was not of great interest to him. He also made statements denying climate change that were discordant with the <a href="/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change" title="Scientific opinion on climate change">opinion of the scientific community</a>. In February 2015, Trump opted not to renew his television contract for <i>The Apprentice</i>, generating speculation that he might run for president in 2016.</p><p>On June 16, 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a> at <a href="/wiki/Trump_Tower_(New_York_City)" title="Trump Tower (New York City)">Trump Tower</a> in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>.

During the primaries, political contenders described him as &quot;divisive&quot;, &quot;unserious&quot;, and a &quot;bully&quot;, denouncing the personal attacks he makes on journalists, politicians, and competing candidates. However, Trump&apos;s candidacy succeeded with Republican primary voters, partly because of widespread media coverage, his ability to largely self-finance his campaign without reliance on <a href="/wiki/Super_PAC" class="mw-redirect" title="Super PAC">super PACs</a>, frequent <a href="/wiki/List_of_Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign_endorsements,_2016" title="List of Donald Trump presidential campaign endorsements, 2016">endorsements</a>, and the perception that he &quot;tells it like it is&quot;. As of June 2016, about 4% of his campaign was funded by <a href="/wiki/Super_PAC" class="mw-redirect" title="Super PAC">super PACs</a>.</p><p>Trump has generally employed strong rhetoric. He has supported Christian groups in the U.S., claiming that he will reverse unfavorable tax treatments preventing them from expressing themselves in the political arena and promising to revive a more widespread use of the phrase &quot;<a href="/wiki/Merry_Christmas" class="mw-redirect" title="Merry Christmas">Merry Christmas</a>&quot; instead of &quot;<a href="/wiki/Happy_Holidays" class="mw-redirect" title="Happy Holidays">Happy Holidays</a>&quot; in department stores.

On <a href="/wiki/Republican_Party_presidential_primaries,_2016#March_1.2C_2016:_Super_Tuesday" title="Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016">Super Tuesday</a>, Trump won the majority of the delegates and remained the front-runner throughout the primaries. By March 2016, Trump reached over 50% in national support from Republican primary voters and became poised to win the Republican nomination.

During the Republican Party Primary, Trump said that the <a href="/wiki/Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States" title="Minimum wage in the United States">minimum wage</a> should not be raised because increasing it would hurt America&apos;s economic competitiveness.

Trump has been critical of <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, comparing it to North Korea, describing it as &quot;probably the most dangerous country&quot; in the world, and saying that <a href="/wiki/Pakistan_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction#Security_concerns_of_the_United_States" title="Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction">Pakistan&apos;s nuclear weapons</a> posed a &quot;serious problem.&quot; He has advocated improving relations with <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a> as a &quot;check&quot; to Pakistan.</p><p>Trump has said that the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">EPA</a> is a &quot;disgrace&quot; and has promised to cut its budget. He has called <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a> &quot;a total hoax&quot;, claiming at one point that it was perpetrated by the Chinese to harm American businesses.</p><p>Trump&apos;s immigration policies have been among his most highly discussed policies during the campaign. While many of Trump&apos;s policies appeal to <a href="/wiki/Working-class" class="mw-redirect" title="Working-class">working-class</a> voters, some have come under scrutiny by several experts on immigration who question the effectiveness and affordability of his plans.</p><p>Trump has emphasized U.S. border security, but says that his specific proposals during the campaign are flexible suggestions. Trump vows to strengthen the <a href="/wiki/Mexico%E2%80%93United_States_border" title="Mexico&#x2013;United States border">Mexico&#x2013;United States border</a> by building a substantial wall in order to keep out <a href="/wiki/Illegal_immigrants" class="mw-redirect" title="Illegal immigrants">illegal immigrants</a>, a wall which Trump promises Mexico will pay for. Trump would also create a &quot;deportation force&quot; to deport around <a href="/wiki/Illegal_immigrant_population_of_the_United_States" title="Illegal immigrant population of the United States">11 million people illegally residing in the U.S.</a>, stating &quot;Day 1 of my presidency, [illegal immigrants] are getting out and getting out fast.&quot; During Trump&apos;s campaign, <a href="/wiki/Naturalization#United_States" title="Naturalization">U.S. naturalization</a> applications spiked by 14 percent, creating speculation illegal immigrants are rushing to become U.S. citizens out of fear of being deported if Trump becomes President. Trump also opposes <a href="/wiki/Birthright_citizenship_in_the_United_States" title="Birthright citizenship in the United States">birthright citizenship</a>, arguing people born in the United States shouldn&apos;t automatically be granted U.S. citizenship.</p><p>One of Trump&apos;s most controversial proposals was a temporary ban on foreign Muslims entering the United States. This proposal by Trump came in response to a wave of radical Islamic <a href="/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents,_July%E2%80%93December_2015" title="List of terrorist incidents, July&#x2013;December 2015">terrorist attacks</a> in Europe, with Trump stating that <a href="/wiki/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> and <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a> had been blighted by the failure of Muslims in these countries to integrate, and that living in <a href="/wiki/Brussels" title="Brussels">Brussels</a> was like living in a &quot;hellhole&quot; because of its dire state in Muslim assimilation. The proposal came under heavy scrutiny, with critics saying such a ban would go against American values, or against the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Constitution" title="United States Constitution">Constitution</a>. Trump later modified his position by stating that the temporary ban would apply to people originating from countries with a proven history of terrorism against the United States or its allies. Trump has said that the ban would be lifted once the government has perfected its ability to screen out potential terrorists.</p><p>According to political writer <a href="/wiki/Steve_Benen" title="Steve Benen">Steve Benen</a>, unlike past political leaders, Trump has not kept <a href="/wiki/Fringe_theory" title="Fringe theory">fringe theories</a> and their supporters at arm&apos;s length. Political writer <a href="/wiki/Jack_Shafer" title="Jack Shafer">Jack Shafer</a> says that Trump may be a &quot;fairly conventional American populist when it comes to his policy views&quot;, but he has a revolutionary ability to attract <a href="/wiki/Earned_media" title="Earned media">free media attention</a>, sometimes by making outrageous comments.</p><p>Although Trump has refused to discuss his past comments on Obama&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories" title="Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories">proof of citizenship</a> during the campaign, he has not shied away from other topics that attract fringe theorists. Among others, Trump has alluded to the theory that President Obama is <a href="/wiki/Barack_Obama_religion_conspiracy_theories" title="Barack Obama religion conspiracy theories">secretly a Muslim</a>, the <a href="/wiki/MMR_vaccine_controversy" title="MMR vaccine controversy">unfounded notion</a> that vaccine doses cause <a href="/wiki/Autism" title="Autism">autism</a> if administered too quickly in succession, and the <a href="/wiki/Conspiracy_theory" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a> that former Supreme Court Justice <a href="/wiki/Antonin_Scalia" title="Antonin Scalia">Antonin Scalia</a> might not have died of natural causes but was murdered.</p><p>Trump has had three marriages, the first two ending in divorce, which have been publicized in the <a href="/wiki/Tabloid_journalism" title="Tabloid journalism">tabloid media</a>.

Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka now serve as executive vice presidents of <a href="/wiki/The_Trump_Organization" title="The Trump Organization">The Trump Organization</a>.</p><p>Ivana became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1988, with Trump at her side. Trump is popularly known as &quot;The Donald&quot;, a nickname perpetuated by the media after Ivana referred to him as such in a 1989 <a href="/wiki/Spy_(magazine)" title="Spy (magazine)"><i>Spy</i> magazine</a> cover story. By early 1990, Trump&apos;s troubled marriage to Ivana and long-running affair with actress <a href="/wiki/Marla_Maples" title="Marla Maples">Marla Maples</a> had become fodder for the tabloid press. The couple divorced in 1991; then in October of that year his mother was mugged, and in November he helped a stranger who was being mugged. In 1992, he sued Ivana for not honoring a gag clause in their divorce agreement by disclosing facts about him in her best-selling book, and Trump won a gag order. In 2015, Ivana said that she and Donald &quot;are the best of friends&quot;.</p><p>Maples gave birth to their daughter Tiffany on October 13, 1993. They married two months later on December 20, 1993. The couple formally separated in May 1997, with their divorce finalized in June 1999.</p><p>In 1998, Trump began a relationship with <a href="/wiki/Slovenia" title="Slovenia">Slovenian</a>-born fashion model <a href="/wiki/Melania_Trump" title="Melania Trump">Melania Knauss</a>. They became engaged in April 2004 and were married on January 22, 2005 at <a href="/wiki/Bethesda-by-the-Sea" title="Bethesda-by-the-Sea">Bethesda-by-the-Sea</a> Episcopal Church, on the island of <a href="/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida" title="Palm Beach, Florida">Palm Beach</a>, Florida, followed by a reception at Trump&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Mar-a-Lago" title="Mar-a-Lago">Mar-a-Lago</a> estate. In 2006, Melania became a naturalized U.S. citizen. In March 2006, she gave birth to their son whom they named Barron William Trump. (Trump had previously used the pseudonym &quot;John Baron&quot; or &quot;Barron&quot; in some business deals and for other purposes.) Having spoken the language since his childhood, Barron is fluent in <a href="/wiki/Slovene_language" title="Slovene language">Slovenian</a>. In a February 2009 interview on ABC&apos;s news program <a href="/wiki/Nightline_(US_news_program)" class="mw-redirect" title="Nightline (US news program)"><i>Nightline</i></a>, Trump commented that his love for his business had made it difficult for his first two wives to compete with his affection for work.</p><p>Trump has eight grandchildren: five via his son Donald Jr., and three via his daughter Ivanka.</p><p>His brother Fred Jr. predeceased his father Fred, and, shortly after the latter died in 1999, Fred III&apos;s wife gave birth to a son with serious medical problems. Trump and his family offered to pay the medical bills through Fred Sr.&apos;s company (Fred Sr. freely provided medical coverage to his family through his company for decades). Fred III then sued the family for allegedly having used &quot;undue influence&quot; on a dementia-stricken Fred Sr. to get Fred III and his sister Mary a reduced share from their grandfather&apos;s will, but Trump attributed the reduced share to his father&apos;s dislike of Fred III&apos;s mother, and Trump stopped the aid for Fred III&apos;s son. The aid was resumed by court order pending outcome of the lawsuit, which was then settled.</p><p>Trump is a <a href="/wiki/Presbyterian" class="mw-redirect" title="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a>.

And you know I&apos;ve had a good relationship with the church over the years. I think religion is a wonderful thing. I think my religion is a wonderful religion.&quot; Trump told a 2015 South Carolina campaign audience he attends <a href="/wiki/Marble_Collegiate_Church" title="Marble Collegiate Church">Marble Collegiate Church</a>, where he married his first wife Ivana in 1977. Marble has said that, though Trump has a longstanding history with the church, he is a Presbyterian and not an active member of Marble. Trump has said that although he participates in <a href="/wiki/Holy_Communion" class="mw-redirect" title="Holy Communion">Holy Communion</a>, he has not asked God for forgiveness for his sins. He stated, &quot;I think if I do something wrong, I think, I just try and make it right.

The Bible! Nothing beats the Bible.&quot; Declining to name his favorite <a href="/wiki/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a> verse, Trump said &quot;I don&apos;t like giving that out to people that you hardly know.&quot;</p><p>Trump maintains relationships with several prominent national <a href="/wiki/Evangelicalism" title="Evangelicalism">Evangelical Protestant</a> and other <a href="/wiki/Christian" title="Christian">Christian</a> leaders, including <a href="/wiki/Tony_Perkins_(politician)" title="Tony Perkins (politician)">Tony Perkins</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ralph_E._Reed,_Jr." title="Ralph E.

At an <i><a href="/wiki/Algemeiner_Journal" title="Algemeiner Journal">Algemeiner Journal</a></i> awards ceremony honoring him with the Algemeiner Liberty Award, he was asked about having <a href="/wiki/Jewish" class="mw-redirect" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> grandchildren. In reference to daughter <a href="/wiki/Ivanka_Trump" title="Ivanka Trump">Ivanka</a>, who <a href="/wiki/Conversion_to_Judaism" title="Conversion to Judaism">converted</a> to <a href="/wiki/Judaism" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> before her marriage to <a href="/wiki/Jared_Kushner" title="Jared Kushner">Jared Kushner</a>, Trump said: &quot;Not only do I have Jewish grandchildren, I have a Jewish daughter; and I am very honored by that ... it wasn&apos;t in the plan but I am very glad it happened.&quot;</p><p>In February 2016, while on his way home following a visit to Mexico, <a href="/wiki/Pope_Francis" title="Pope Francis">Pope Francis</a> said the following:</p><p>A person who thinks only about building walls&#x2014;wherever they may be&#x2014;and not building bridges, is not Christian. ...I&apos;d just say that this man [Trump] is not Christian if he said it this way. ...We must see if he said things in that way and in this I give the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>Trump responded that it was &quot;disgraceful&quot; for the Pope to question his faith, and suggested that the Mexican government was &quot;using the Pope as a pawn&quot; for political purposes, &quot;because they want to continue to rip off the United States.&quot; Trump said that &quot;if and when&quot; the <a href="/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant" title="Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant">Islamic State (ISIL)</a> attacks the Vatican, the Pope would have &quot;wished and prayed&quot; Trump were President because under Trump&apos;s leadership, such an attack would not happen.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, Director of the <a href="/wiki/Holy_See_Press_Office" title="Holy See Press Office">Holy See Press Office</a> <a href="/wiki/Federico_Lombardi" title="Federico Lombardi">Federico Lombardi</a> insisted that the Pope was &quot;in no way&quot; launching an attack on Donald Trump nor was he trying to sway voters by declaring someone who advocates building walls isn&apos;t Christian. The spokesman said that &quot;the Pope has made it clear that he would not enter into the [presidential] election campaign in the United States&quot;, and indeed the headlines in the United States had gone considerably beyond what the Pope had actually said. After the clarification by Lombardi, Trump retracted his criticism of the Pope: &quot;I don&apos;t think this is a fight,&quot; said Trump. &quot;I think he said something much softer than was originally reported by the media.&quot;</p><p>Trump has never done drugs, or smoked cigarettes, and has always heeded a warning from his older brother (an alcoholic) to not drink alcohol. He also has <a href="/wiki/Mysophobia" title="Mysophobia">germaphobic</a> tendencies, and therefore prefers not to shake hands.</p><p>On <i><a href="/wiki/The_Howard_Stern_Show" title="The Howard Stern Show">The Howard Stern Show</a></i> in 1997, Trump discussed with Stern the risk of getting diseases from dating, and agreed with Stern&apos;s characterization of dating as Trump&apos;s &quot;personal Vietnam&quot;. Trump said he felt &quot;like a great and very brave soldier&quot;, but added, &quot;This is better than Vietnam&quot;.</p><p>Trump has hinted about &quot;experiences&quot; with married women.

He allegedly &quot;bombarded&quot; <a href="/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales" title="Diana, Princess of Wales">Princess Diana</a> with expensive flowers after her 1996 divorce from <a href="/wiki/Charles,_Prince_of_Wales" title="Charles, Prince of Wales">Prince Charles</a>, and has said that he would have liked to have courted that &quot;genuine princess&quot;. He sometimes gave the impression that Diana and/or Charles had an interest in his properties, which they apparently did not.</p><p>In an interview with director <a href="/wiki/Errol_Morris" title="Errol Morris">Errol Morris</a> in 2002, Trump told him that <i><a href="/wiki/Citizen_Kane" title="Citizen Kane">Citizen Kane</a></i> was his favorite movie. In his personal analysis of the film, Trump believes that the message of the film is that &quot;wealth isn&apos;t everything...because [Kane] had the wealth, but he didn&apos;t have happiness.&quot; Furthermore, Trump explained his meaning of the dinner table scene: &quot;The table [keeps] getting larger and larger and larger, with [Kane] and his wife getting further and further apart as he got wealthier and wealthier....perhaps, I can understand that.&quot;</p><p>Even before Trump&apos;s very highly publicized presidential campaign that began in 2015, he often appeared in popular culture. Trump has been depicted in the <i><a href="/wiki/Doonesbury" title="Doonesbury">Doonesbury</a></i> comic strip by <a href="/wiki/Garry_Trudeau" title="Garry Trudeau">Garry Trudeau</a> since 1987. The depictions prompted an unfavorable response from Trump.</p><p>Trump and members of his family have been parodied on <i><a href="/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live" title="Saturday Night Live">Saturday Night Live</a></i> since 1988, and he has hosted the show twice, in April 2004 and November 2015.

Colbert&apos;s reasoning for including a cartoon version of Trump is because he felt like that Trump had resorted to &quot;almost cartoonish tactics&quot;. Meanwhile, on <i><a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel_Live!" title="Jimmy Kimmel Live!">Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel" title="Jimmy Kimmel">Jimmy Kimmel</a> wrote two <a href="/wiki/Dr._Seuss" title="Dr. Seuss">Dr. Seuss</a>-like books: &quot;Winners aren&apos;t Losers&quot; and its sequel &quot;Winners Still Aren&apos;t Losers&quot;.

Some of the lawsuits have been initiated by Trump as <a href="/wiki/Plaintiff" title="Plaintiff">plaintiff</a>, and others have been initiated by others against him as <a href="/wiki/Defendant" title="Defendant">defendant</a>.

After a helicopter crashed, killing three executives of his New Jersey hotel casino business, Trump sued the manufacturers, and that case was dismissed. <a href="/wiki/Trump_Plaza_Hotel_and_Casino" title="Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino">Trump Plaza</a> was fined $200,000 for moving African-American and female employees away from a racist and sexist gambler to accommodate him, but Trump was not evidently investigated, nor held personally liable, and said he would not even recognize that gambler. Also during that decade, Trump&apos;s father, Fred Trump, made an unlawful loan to <a href="/wiki/Golden_Nugget_Atlantic_City" title="Golden Nugget Atlantic City">Trump&apos;s Castle</a> to help it make a mortgage payment, and the casino was required to pay a $30,000 fine, but his son was not penalized.</p><p>Also in the 1990s, Trump sued business partner <a href="/wiki/Jay_Pritzker" title="Jay Pritzker">Jay Pritzker</a> for allegedly collecting excessive fees, and the matter was settled. Boarding house owner <a href="/wiki/Vera_Coking" title="Vera Coking">Vera Coking</a> sued for damage during construction of an adjacent casino, and later dropped the suit against Trump while settling with his contractor; she also prevailed against Trump and other developers in an <a href="/wiki/Eminent_domain" title="Eminent domain">eminent domain</a> case.

When the California city of <a href="/wiki/Rancho_Palos_Verdes,_California" title="Rancho Palos Verdes, California">Rancho Palos Verdes</a> thwarted luxury home development on a landslide-prone area owned by Trump, he sued, and the city agreed to permit extensions for some 20 more proposed luxury homes. Trump sued a law firm he had used, Morrison Cohen, for using his name, for providing news links at its website, and for charging excessive fees, after which the firm halved the fees, and the court ruled that the links were allowable. And, in the late 2000s, Trump was sued by investors in the canceled <a href="/wiki/Trump_Ocean_Resort_Baja_Mexico" title="Trump Ocean Resort Baja Mexico">Trump Ocean Resort Baja Mexico</a>; Trump said he had merely been a spokesperson, and he settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount.</p><p>In the 2010s, the Trump Organization licensed a hotel and condo project in <a href="/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale" class="mw-redirect" title="Fort Lauderdale">Fort Lauderdale</a>, but the <a href="/wiki/United_States_housing_bubble" title="United States housing bubble">bursting of the real estate bubble</a> led Trump to dissolve the deal, after which the project defaulted, investors sued, and Trump was caught in the ongoing lawsuits because he had participated in advertising. Trump personally guaranteed $40 million to secure a $640 million loan for <a href="/wiki/Trump_International_Hotel_and_Tower_(Chicago)" title="Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)">Trump International Hotel and Tower</a> in Chicago, and when <a href="/wiki/Deutsche_Bank" title="Deutsche Bank">Deutsche Bank</a> tried to collect it, Trump sued the bank for harming the project and his reputation, and the bank then agreed to extend the loan term by five years. The <a href="/wiki/College_of_Justice" title="College of Justice">Supreme Court of Scotland</a> rejected Trump&apos;s suits against the nation of Scotland, in which Trump had alleged that the country was illegally building a wind farm near his golf course and planned hotel.</p><p>Also in the 2010s, Trump sued the former <a href="/wiki/Miss_Pennsylvania" title="Miss Pennsylvania">Miss Pennsylvania</a> <a href="/wiki/Sheena_Monnin" title="Sheena Monnin">Sheena Monnin</a> after she alleged that the <a href="/wiki/Miss_USA_2012" title="Miss USA 2012">Miss USA 2012</a> pageant was rigged, and a federal judge upheld the settlement obliging her to pay Trump $5 million.
