Three-quarters of the atmosphere&apos;s mass is contained within the first 11&#xA0;km of the surface. This lowest layer is called the troposphere. Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises, and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_circulation" title="Atmospheric circulation">atmospheric circulation</a> that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.</p><p>The primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the <a href="/wiki/Trade_winds" title="Trade winds">trade winds</a> in the equatorial region below 30&#xB0; latitude and the <a href="/wiki/Westerlies" title="Westerlies">westerlies</a> in the mid-latitudes between 30&#xB0; and 60&#xB0;. <a href="/wiki/Ocean_current" title="Ocean current">Ocean currents</a> are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the <a href="/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation" title="Thermohaline circulation">thermohaline circulation</a> that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.</p><p>Water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation. Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This <a href="/wiki/Water_cycle" title="Water cycle">water cycle</a> is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land, and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.</p><p>The amount of solar energy reaching Earth&apos;s surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about 0.4&#xA0;&#xB0;C (0.7&#xA0;&#xB0;F) per degree of latitude from the equator. Earth&apos;s surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate.

Another anomaly is the impact of landmass on temperature, manifested by the fact that Earth is much warmer at <a href="/wiki/Aphelion" class="mw-redirect" title="Aphelion">aphelion</a>, where the planet is at a more distant position from the Sun. When the Northern hemisphere is turned towards the sunlight even the increased distance to it does not hinder temperatures to be 2.3&#xA0;&#xB0;C (4&#xA0;&#xB0;F) warmer than at <a href="/wiki/Perihelion" class="mw-redirect" title="Perihelion">perihelion</a>&#x2014;when the marine southern hemisphere is turned towards the Sun.</p><p>At high latitudes, the western sides of continents tend to be milder than the eastern sides&#x2014;for example seen in North America and Western Europe where rough continental climates appear on the east coast on parallels with mild climates on the other side of the ocean.</p><p>The highest air temperature ever measured on Earth was 56.7&#xA0;&#xB0;C (134.1&#xA0;&#xB0;F) in <a href="/wiki/Furnace_Creek,_California" title="Furnace Creek, California">Furnace Creek, California</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Death_Valley_National_Park" title="Death Valley National Park">Death Valley</a>, in 1913.

Beyond these, the <a href="/wiki/Exosphere" title="Exosphere">exosphere</a> thins out into the <a href="/wiki/Magnetosphere" title="Magnetosphere">magnetosphere</a>, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the <a href="/wiki/Solar_wind" title="Solar wind">solar wind</a>. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The <a href="/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line" title="K&#xE1;rm&#xE1;n line">K&#xE1;rm&#xE1;n line</a>, defined as 100&#xA0;km above Earth&apos;s surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and <a href="/wiki/Outer_space" title="Outer space">outer space</a>.</p><p>Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth&apos;s gravity. This causes a slow but steady <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_escape" title="Atmospheric escape">leakage of the atmosphere into space</a>. Because unfixed <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> has a low <a href="/wiki/Molecular_mass" title="Molecular mass">molecular mass</a>, it can achieve <a href="/wiki/Escape_velocity" title="Escape velocity">escape velocity</a> more readily and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases. The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth&apos;s atmosphere and surface from an initially <a href="/wiki/Redox" title="Redox">reducing</a> state to its current <a href="/wiki/Redox" title="Redox">oxidizing</a> one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth. In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.</p><p>The main part of <a href="/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field" title="Earth&apos;s magnetic field">Earth&apos;s magnetic field</a> is generated in the core, the site of a <a href="/wiki/Dynamo" title="Dynamo">dynamo</a> process that converts kinetic energy of fluid convective motion into electrical and magnetic field energy. The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth&apos;s surface, where it is, to rough approximation, a <a href="/wiki/Dipole" title="Dipole">dipole</a>. The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth&apos;s geographic poles.

The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment. This causes <a href="/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal" title="Geomagnetic reversal">field reversals</a> at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years. The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago.</p><p>The extent of Earth&apos;s magnetic field in space defines the magnetosphere. Ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail. Because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which wave propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind. <a href="/wiki/Charged_particles" class="mw-redirect" title="Charged particles">Charged particles</a> are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates; the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the <a href="/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt" title="Van Allen radiation belt">Van Allen radiation belt</a> are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.</p><p>During a magnetic storm, charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere, directed along field lines into Earth&apos;s ionosphere, where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized, causing the <a href="/wiki/Aurora_(astronomy)" class="mw-redirect" title="Aurora (astronomy)">aurora</a>.</p><p>Earth&apos;s rotation period relative to the Sun&#x2014;its mean solar day&#x2014;is 86,400&#xA0;seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025&#xA0;<a href="/wiki/SI" class="mw-redirect" title="SI">SI</a>&#xA0;seconds).

For bodies near the <a href="/wiki/Celestial_equator" title="Celestial equator">celestial equator</a>, this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth&apos;s surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.</p><p>Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 150&#xA0;million kilometres (93,000,000&#xA0;mi) every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one <a href="/wiki/Sidereal_year" title="Sidereal year">sidereal year</a>. This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1&#xB0;/day, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12&#xA0;hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes 24&#xA0;hours&#x2014;a <a href="/wiki/Solar_time" title="Solar time">solar day</a>&#x2014;for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the <a href="/wiki/Meridian_(astronomy)" title="Meridian (astronomy)">meridian</a>. The orbital speed of Earth averages about 29.8&#xA0;km/s (107,000&#xA0;km/h), which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth&apos;s diameter, about 12,742&#xA0;km (7,918&#xA0;mi), in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon, 384,000&#xA0;km (239,000&#xA0;mi), in about 3.5 hours.</p><p>The Moon and Earth orbit a common <a href="/wiki/Barycenter" title="Barycenter">barycenter</a> every 27.32&#xA0;days relative to the background stars.

Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Axial_tilt" title="Axial tilt">axis is tilted</a> some 23.4&#xA0;degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth&#x2013;Sun plane (the <a href="/wiki/Ecliptic" title="Ecliptic">ecliptic</a>), and the Earth&#x2013;Moon plane is tilted up to &#xB1;5.1&#xA0;degrees against the Earth&#x2013;Sun plane.

This is the maximum distance at which the Earth&apos;s gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets. Objects must orbit Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.</p><p>Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the <a href="/wiki/Milky_Way" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a> and orbits about 28,000&#xA0;<a href="/wiki/Light-year" title="Light-year">light-years</a> from its center.

Due to Earth&apos;s axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes seasonal change in climate, with <a href="/wiki/Summer" title="Summer">summer</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Northern_hemisphere" class="mw-redirect" title="Northern hemisphere">northern hemisphere</a> occurring when the North Pole is pointing toward the Sun, and <a href="/wiki/Winter" title="Winter">winter</a> taking place when the pole is pointed away. During the summer, the day lasts longer and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes generally cooler and the days shorter. In northern temperate latitudes, the Sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice, and sets north of true west, reversing in the winter. The Sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone, and sets south of true west.</p><p>Above the <a href="/wiki/Arctic_Circle" title="Arctic Circle">Arctic Circle</a>, an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year, up to six months at the North Pole itself, a <a href="/wiki/Polar_night" title="Polar night">polar night</a>. In the <a href="/wiki/Southern_hemisphere" class="mw-redirect" title="Southern hemisphere">southern hemisphere</a> the situation is exactly reversed, with the <a href="/wiki/South_Pole" title="South Pole">South Pole</a> oriented opposite the direction of the North Pole. Six months later, this pole will experience a <a href="/wiki/Midnight_sun" title="Midnight sun">midnight sun</a>, a day of 24 hours, again reversing with the South Pole.</p><p>By astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the <a href="/wiki/Solstice" title="Solstice">solstices</a> &#x2014; the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun &#x2014; and the <a href="/wiki/Equinox" title="Equinox">equinoxes</a>, when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular. In the northern hemisphere, <a href="/wiki/Winter_solstice" title="Winter solstice">winter solstice</a> currently occurs around 21 December, <a href="/wiki/Summer_solstice" title="Summer solstice">summer solstice</a> is near 21 June, <a href="/wiki/Spring_equinox" class="mw-redirect" title="Spring equinox">spring equinox</a> is around 20 March and <a href="/wiki/Autumnal_equinox" class="mw-redirect" title="Autumnal equinox">autumnal equinox</a> is about 22 or 23 September. In the southern hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.</p><p>The angle of Earth&apos;s axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo <a href="/wiki/Nutation" title="Nutation">nutation</a>; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6&#xA0;years. The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth&apos;s axis also changes over time, <a href="/wiki/Precession" title="Precession">precessing</a> around in a complete circle over each 25,800&#xA0;year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_year" title="Tropical year">tropical year</a>. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth&apos;s equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth&apos;s surface. This <a href="/wiki/Polar_motion" title="Polar motion">polar motion</a> has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed <a href="/wiki/Quasiperiodic_motion" title="Quasiperiodic motion">quasiperiodic motion</a>. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the <a href="/wiki/Chandler_wobble" title="Chandler wobble">Chandler wobble</a>. Earth&apos;s rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.</p><p>In modern times, Earth&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Perihelion" class="mw-redirect" title="Perihelion">perihelion</a> occurs around 3 January, and its <a href="/wiki/Aphelion" class="mw-redirect" title="Aphelion">aphelion</a> around 4 July. These dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as <a href="/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles" title="Milankovitch cycles">Milankovitch cycles</a>. The changing Earth&#x2013;Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9% in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the southern hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the southern hemisphere.</p><p>A planet that can sustain life is termed <a href="/wiki/Planetary_habitability" title="Planetary habitability">habitable</a>, even if life did not originate there.

The distance of Earth from the Sun, as well as its orbital eccentricity, rate of rotation, axial tilt, geological history, sustaining atmosphere and protective magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface.</p><p>A planet&apos;s life forms inhabit ecosystems, whose total is sometimes said to form a &quot;biosphere&quot;.

Normally, the only humans in space are those on the <a href="/wiki/International_Space_Station" title="International Space Station">International Space Station</a>. The station&apos;s <a href="/wiki/List_of_International_Space_Station_expeditions" title="List of International Space Station expeditions">crew</a>, made up of six people, is usually replaced every six months. The farthest that humans have travelled from Earth is 400,171&#xA0;km, achieved during the <a href="/wiki/Apollo_13" title="Apollo 13">Apollo 13</a> mission in 1970.</p><p>The Moon is a relatively large, <a href="/wiki/Terrestrial_planet" title="Terrestrial planet">terrestrial</a>, planet-like <a href="/wiki/Natural_satellite" title="Natural satellite">natural satellite</a>, with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth&apos;s.

The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as &quot;moons&quot;, after Earth&apos;s.</p><p>The gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes <a href="/wiki/Tides" class="mw-redirect" title="Tides">tides</a> on Earth. The same effect on the Moon has led to its <a href="/wiki/Tidal_locking" title="Tidal locking">tidal locking</a>: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the <a href="/wiki/Lunar_phase" title="Lunar phase">lunar phases</a>; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the <a href="/wiki/Terminator_(solar)" title="Terminator (solar)">solar terminator</a>.</p><p>Due to their <a href="/wiki/Tidal_acceleration" title="Tidal acceleration">tidal interaction</a>, the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately 38&#xA0;mm/yr. Over millions of years, these tiny modifications&#x2014;and the lengthening of Earth&apos;s day by about 23&#xA0;<a href="/wiki/Microsecond" title="Microsecond">&#xB5;s</a>/yr&#x2014;add up to significant changes. During the <a href="/wiki/Devonian" title="Devonian">Devonian</a> period, for example, (approximately <span class="nowrap"><span style="display:none" class="sortkey">7016129386160000000&#x2660;</span>410&#xA0;mya</span>) there were 400 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.8 hours.</p><p>The Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet&apos;s climate. <a href="/wiki/Paleontology" title="Paleontology">Paleontological</a> evidence and computer simulations show that Earth&apos;s axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon. Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the <a href="/wiki/Torque" title="Torque">torques</a> applied by the Sun and planets to Earth&apos;s equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years, as appears to be the case for Mars.</p><p>Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The <a href="/wiki/Angular_size" class="mw-redirect" title="Angular size">angular size</a> (or <a href="/wiki/Solid_angle" title="Solid angle">solid angle</a>) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun&apos;s diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon&apos;s, it is also 400 times more distant. This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.</p><p>The most widely accepted theory of the Moon&apos;s origin, the <a href="/wiki/Giant_impact_hypothesis" class="mw-redirect" title="Giant impact hypothesis">giant impact theory</a>, states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon&apos;s relative lack of iron and volatile elements, and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth&apos;s crust.</p><p>Earth has at least five <a href="/wiki/Quasi-satellite" title="Quasi-satellite">co-orbital asteroids</a>, including <a href="/wiki/3753_Cruithne" title="3753 Cruithne">3753 Cruithne</a> and <span class="nowrap"><a href="/wiki/2002_AA29" title="2002 AA29">2002 AA<span style="position: relative; top: 0.3em;"><span style="font-size:80%;">29</span></span></a></span>.

In the West, belief in a <a href="/wiki/Flat_Earth" title="Flat Earth">flat Earth</a> was displaced by the idea of <a href="/wiki/Spherical_Earth" title="Spherical Earth">spherical Earth</a>, credited to <a href="/wiki/Pythagoras" title="Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a> in the 6th century BC. Earth was further believed to be <a href="/wiki/Geocentric_model" title="Geocentric model">the center of the universe</a> until the 16th century, when scientists first theorized that it was <a href="/wiki/Heliocentrism" title="Heliocentrism">a moving object</a>, comparable to the other planets in the Solar System. Due to the efforts of influential Christian scholars and clerics such as <a href="/wiki/James_Ussher" title="James Ussher">James Ussher</a>, who sought to determine the age of Earth through analysis of genealogies in Scripture, Westerners prior to the 19th century generally believed Earth to be a few thousand years old at most. It was only during the 19th century that geologists realized <a href="/wiki/Earth%27s_age" class="mw-redirect" title="Earth&apos;s age">Earth&apos;s age</a> was at least many millions of years. <a href="/wiki/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin" title="William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin">Lord Kelvin</a> used <a href="/wiki/Thermodynamics" title="Thermodynamics">thermodynamics</a> to estimate the age of Earth to be between 20 million and 400 million years in 1864, sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; it was only when radioactivity and <a href="/wiki/Radiometric_dating" title="Radiometric dating">radioactive dating</a> were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth&apos;s age was established, proving the planet to be billions of years old.
