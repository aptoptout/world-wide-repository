<p>James was born on December 30, 1984 in <a href="/wiki/Akron,_Ohio" title="Akron, Ohio">Akron</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ohio" title="Ohio">Ohio</a>, to a 16-year-old mother, Gloria Marie James, who raised him on her own. Growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while James&apos; mother struggled to find steady work. Realizing he would be better off with a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed James to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach, who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.</p>
<p>As a youth, James played <a href="/wiki/Amateur_Athletic_Union" title="Amateur Athletic Union">Amateur Athletic Union</a> (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars. The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee. Inseparable, they dubbed themselves the &quot;Fab Four&quot; and promised each other they would attend high school together. In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend <a href="/wiki/St._Vincent%E2%80%93St._Mary_High_School" title="St. Vincent&#x2013;St. Mary High School">St. Vincent&#x2013;St. Mary High School</a>, a largely <a href="/wiki/Caucasian_race" title="Caucasian race">white</a> private <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic" class="mw-redirect" title="Roman Catholic">Catholic</a> school.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="High_school_career">High school career</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Basketball">Basketball</span></h3>
<p>As a freshman, James averaged 21 <a href="/wiki/Point_(basketball)" title="Point (basketball)">points</a> and 6 <a href="/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)" title="Rebound (basketball)">rebounds</a> per game for St. Vincent-St. Mary&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Varsity_sports" class="mw-redirect" title="Varsity sports">varsity</a> team. The Fighting Irish finished the year 27&#x2013;0, winning the Division III state title. As a sophomore, he averaged 25.2 points and 7.2 rebounds with 5.8 <a href="/wiki/Assist_(basketball)" title="Assist (basketball)">assists</a> and 3.8 <a href="/wiki/Steal_(basketball)" title="Steal (basketball)">steals</a> per game. For some home games during the season, St. Vincent-St. Mary played at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Akron" title="University of Akron">University of Akron</a>&apos;s 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, and college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play. The Fighting Irish finished the season 26&#x2013;1 and repeated as state champions. For his outstanding play, James was named <a href="/wiki/Ohio_Mr._Basketball" title="Ohio Mr. Basketball">Ohio&apos;s Mr. Basketball</a> and was selected to the <a href="/wiki/USA_Today_All-USA_high_school_basketball_team" title="USA Today All-USA high school basketball team"><i>USA Today</i> All-USA First Team</a>, becoming the first sophomore to do either.</p>
<p>Prior to the start of James&apos; junior year, he appeared in <i><a href="/wiki/SLAM_Magazine" class="mw-redirect" title="SLAM Magazine">SLAM Magazine</a></i> and was lauded as possibly &quot;the best high school basketball player in America right now.&quot; During the season, he appeared on the cover of <i><a href="/wiki/Sports_Illustrated" title="Sports Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a></i>, becoming the first underclass high school basketball player to do so. With averages of 29 points, 8.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists, and 3.3 steals per game, he was again named Ohio&apos;s Mr. Basketball and selected to the <i>USA Today</i> All-USA First Team, and became the first junior to win the boys&apos; basketball <a href="/wiki/Gatorade_National_Player_of_the_Year" class="mw-redirect" title="Gatorade National Player of the Year">Gatorade National Player of the Year Award</a>. St. Vincent-St. Mary finished the year with a 23&#x2013;4 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game. Following the loss, James seriously considered declaring for the <a href="/wiki/2002_NBA_draft" title="2002 NBA draft">2002 NBA draft</a>, unsuccessfully petitioning for an adjustment to the NBA&apos;s draft eligibility rules which required prospective players to have at least graduated from high school. During this time, James used <a href="/wiki/Marijuana" class="mw-redirect" title="Marijuana">marijuana</a> to help cope with stress resulting from the constant media attention he was receiving.</p>
<p>During his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled around the country to play a number of nationally ranked teams, including a game against Oak Hill Academy that was nationally televised on <a href="/wiki/ESPN2" title="ESPN2">ESPN2</a>. <a href="/wiki/Time_Warner_Cable" title="Time Warner Cable">Time Warner Cable</a>, looking to capitalize on James&apos; popularity, offered St. Vincent-St. Mary&apos;s games to subscribers on a <a href="/wiki/Pay-per-view" title="Pay-per-view">pay-per-view</a> basis throughout the season. For the year, James averaged 31.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 3.4 steals per game, was named Ohio&apos;s Mr. Basketball and <i>USA Today</i> All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year, and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year. He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star games&#x2014;the <a href="/wiki/EA_Sports" title="EA Sports">EA Sports</a> Roundball Classic, the Jordan Capital Classic, and the 2003 <a href="/wiki/McDonald%27s_All-American_Game" title="McDonald&apos;s All-American Game">McDonald&apos;s All-American Game</a>&#x2014;losing his <a href="/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association" title="National Collegiate Athletic Association">NCAA</a> eligibility and making it official he would enter the 2003 NBA draft. According to writer Ryan Jones, James left high school as &quot;the most hyped basketball player ever&quot;.</p>
<p>During his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, he accepted a <a href="/wiki/Hummer_H2" title="Hummer H2">Hummer H2</a> from his mother, who secured a loan for the vehicle utilizing LeBron&apos;s future earning power as a professional athlete. This prompted an investigation by the <a href="/wiki/Ohio_High_School_Athletic_Association" title="Ohio High School Athletic Association">Ohio High School Athletic Association</a> (OHSAA) as its guidelines state that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in his being stripped of his high school sports eligibility. James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season. In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Football">Football</span></h3>
<p>James played <a href="/wiki/Wide_receiver" title="Wide receiver">wide receiver</a> for St. Vincent-St. Mary&apos;s <a href="/wiki/American_football" title="American football">football</a> team in high school and was recruited by some <a href="/wiki/List_of_NCAA_Division_I_FBS_football_programs" title="List of NCAA Division I FBS football programs">Division I programs</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football" title="Notre Dame Fighting Irish football">Notre Dame</a>. As a sophomore, he was named first team all-state, and as a junior, he led the Fighting Irish to the state semifinals. His football career came to an end before his senior year when he broke his wrist during an AAU basketball game. Many sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, and former and current players have speculated on whether he could have played in the <a href="/wiki/National_Football_League" title="National Football League">National Football League</a>.</p>

His 30 points per game were also the highest in the league, representing his first <a href="/wiki/List_of_National_Basketball_Association_season_scoring_leaders" class="mw-redirect" title="List of National Basketball Association season scoring leaders">scoring title</a>. Despite his individual accomplishments, Cleveland&apos;s record fell from the year before to 45&#x2013;37.

<p>At the conclusion of the <a href="/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_NBA_season" title="2008&#x2013;09 NBA season">2008&#x2013;09 season</a>, James finished second in <a href="/wiki/NBA_Defensive_Player_of_the_Year_Award" title="NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award">NBA Defensive Player of the Year</a> voting and made his first <a href="/wiki/NBA_All-Defensive_Team" title="NBA All-Defensive Team">NBA All-Defensive Team</a> with 23 <a href="/wiki/Chase-down_block" class="mw-redirect" title="Chase-down block">chase-down blocks</a> and a career-high 93 total blocks. He also became only the fourth <a href="/wiki/ABA%E2%80%93NBA_merger" class="mw-redirect" title="ABA&#x2013;NBA merger">postmerger</a> player to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks in a single season. Behind his play, Cleveland went a franchise record 66&#x2013;16 and fell one game short of matching the best home record in league history. With averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.2 blocks per game, he became the first Cavalier to win the MVP Award.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/2009_NBA_Playoffs" title="2009 NBA Playoffs">playoffs</a>, Cleveland swept the <a href="/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_Detroit_Pistons_season" title="2008&#x2013;09 Detroit Pistons season">Pistons</a> and the <a href="/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_Atlanta_Hawks_season" title="2008&#x2013;09 Atlanta Hawks season">Atlanta Hawks</a> to earn a match-up with the <a href="/wiki/2008-09_Orlando_Magic_season" class="mw-redirect" title="2008-09 Orlando Magic season">Orlando Magic</a> in the Conference Finals. In Game 1 of the series, James scored 49 points on 66 percent shooting in a losing effort for the Cavaliers. In Game 2, he hit a game-winner to tie the series at 1&#x2013;1. Cleveland would lose the series in six games, and following the loss in Game 6, James immediately left the floor without shaking hands with his opponents, an act many media members viewed as unsportsmanlike. For the series, he averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 8 assists per game, finishing the postseason with a career playoff-high 35.3 points per game.</p>
<p>Midway through the <a href="/wiki/2009%E2%80%9310_NBA_season" title="2009&#x2013;10 NBA season">2009&#x2013;10 season</a>, the Cavaliers&apos; guards experienced significant injuries, forcing James into a temporary <a href="/wiki/Point_guard" title="Point guard">point guard</a> role. With increased minutes as the team&apos;s primary ball handler, he averaged a career-high 8.6 assists with 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 1.6 steals, and 1 block per game on 50 percent shooting en route to a second consecutive MVP Award. Cleveland also finished the season with the league&apos;s best record for the second straight year. In <a href="/wiki/2010_NBA_Playoffs" title="2010 NBA Playoffs">the playoffs</a>, the Cavaliers beat the <a href="/wiki/2009%E2%80%9310_Chicago_Bulls_season" title="2009&#x2013;10 Chicago Bulls season">Bulls</a> in the first round but fell to the <a href="/wiki/2009%E2%80%9310_Boston_Celtics_season" title="2009&#x2013;10 Boston Celtics season">Celtics</a> in the second round. James was heavily criticized for not playing well in Game 5 of the series when he shot only 20 percent on 14 shots, scoring 15 points. At the conclusion of the game, he walked off the court to a smattering of boos from Cleveland&apos;s home crowd, the team having just suffered their worst home playoff loss ever. The Cavaliers were eliminated from the playoffs by the Celtics with a Game 6 defeat despite James recording 27 points, 19 rebounds and 10 assists.</p>

James runs the offense in November 2009. He finished his first stint with the Cavaliers averaging 27.8 points, 7 rebounds, 7 assists, and 1.7 steals per game.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>James became an unrestricted <a href="/wiki/NBA_salary_cap#Free_agency" title="NBA salary cap">free agent</a> at 12:01&#xA0;am EDT on July 1, 2010. During his free agency, he was courted by several teams, including the Bulls, <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers" title="Los Angeles Clippers">Los Angeles Clippers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Miami_Heat" title="Miami Heat">Miami Heat</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York_Knicks" title="New York Knicks">New York Knicks</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey_Nets" class="mw-redirect" title="New Jersey Nets">New Jersey Nets</a>, and Cavaliers. On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled <i>The Decision</i> that he would sign with the Heat. The telecast, broadcast from the <a href="/wiki/Boys_%26_Girls_Clubs_of_America" title="Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America">Boys &amp; Girls Club</a> of <a href="/wiki/Greenwich,_Connecticut" title="Greenwich, Connecticut">Greenwich, Connecticut</a>, raised $2.5 million for the charity and an additional $3.5 million from advertisement revenue that was donated to other charities. The day before the special, fellow free agents <a href="/wiki/Chris_Bosh" title="Chris Bosh">Chris Bosh</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dwyane_Wade" title="Dwyane Wade">Dwyane Wade</a> had also announced that they would sign with Miami; reports later arose that the trio had discussed their 2010 free agencies together in 2006. James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part so that he could shoulder less of the load offensively, thinking that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning a championship than had he stayed in Cleveland. Heat president <a href="/wiki/Pat_Riley" title="Pat Riley">Pat Riley</a> played a major role in selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade. Relieved of the burden of scoring, James thought he could be the first player to average a triple-double in a season since <a href="/wiki/Oscar_Robertson" title="Oscar Robertson">Oscar Robertson</a>.</p>
<p>James drew immense criticism from sports analysts, executives, fans, and current and former players for leaving the Cavaliers. <i>The Decision</i> itself was also scrutinized and viewed as unnecessary. Many thought the prolonged wait for James&apos; choice was unprofessional as not even the teams courting him were aware of his decision until moments before the show. Upon learning that James would not be returning to Cleveland, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert published an open letter to fans in which he aggressively denounced James&apos; actions. Some angry fans of the team recorded videos of themselves burning his jersey. Former NBA players including <a href="/wiki/Michael_Jordan" title="Michael Jordan">Michael Jordan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Magic_Johnson" title="Magic Johnson">Magic Johnson</a> were also critical of James, condemning him for joining with Bosh and Wade in Miami and not trying to win a championship as &quot;the guy&quot;. James drew further criticism in a September interview with CNN when he claimed that race might have been a factor in the fallout from <i>The Decision</i>. As a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period, he quickly gained a reputation as one of America&apos;s most disliked athletes, a radical change from years prior. The phrase &quot;taking my talents to South Beach&quot; became a punch line for critics.</p>
<p>Immediately following <i>The Decision</i>, James claimed that there was nothing he would change about the handling of his free agency despite all the criticism. Since then, he has expressed regret over his actions. During the 2010&#x2013;11 season, he said he &quot;probably would do it a little bit different ... But I&apos;m happy with my decision.&quot; James relented about the special before the 2011&#x2013;12 season: &quot;... if the shoe was on the other foot and I was a fan, and I was very passionate about one player, and he decided to leave, I would be upset too about the way he handled it.&quot;</p>

<p>James officially became a member of the Heat on July 10, completing a <a href="/wiki/Sign-and-trade" class="mw-redirect" title="Sign-and-trade">sign-and-trade</a> six-year contract with the team. With the move, he became only the third reigning MVP to change teams and the first since <a href="/wiki/Moses_Malone" title="Moses Malone">Moses Malone</a> in <a href="/wiki/1981%E2%80%9382_NBA_season" title="1981&#x2013;82 NBA season">1982</a>. Although his contract would have allowed him to earn the maximum salary under the <a href="/wiki/NBA_Collective_Bargaining_Agreement" class="mw-redirect" title="NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement">collective bargaining agreement</a>, he took less money in order for Miami to be able to afford Bosh and Wade as well as further roster support. That evening, the Heat threw a welcome party for their new &quot;big three&quot; at the <a href="/wiki/American_Airlines_Arena" title="American Airlines Arena">American Airlines Arena</a>, an event that took on a rock concert atmosphere. During the gathering, James predicted a dynasty for the Heat and alluded to multiple championships. Outside of Miami the spectacle was not well-received, furthering the negative public perception of James.</p>

His final season averages were 26.8 points, 8 rebounds, 7.3 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 56.5 percent shooting.</p>
<p>In Game 1 of the <a href="/wiki/2013_NBA_playoffs" class="mw-redirect" title="2013 NBA playoffs">Conference Finals</a>, James scored a buzzer-beating layup to give Miami a one-point victory against the <a href="/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_Indiana_Pacers_season" title="2012&#x2013;13 Indiana Pacers season">Pacers</a>.

In contrast to <i>The Decision</i>, his announcement to return to Cleveland was well received. On July 12, he officially signed with the team.

In the <a href="/wiki/2016_NBA_Playoffs" title="2016 NBA Playoffs">playoffs</a>, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the <a href="/wiki/2016_NBA_Finals" title="2016 NBA Finals">Finals</a>, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the <a href="/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_Golden_State_Warriors_season" title="2015&#x2013;16 Golden State Warriors season">Warriors</a>, who were coming off a record-setting 73 win campaign. To begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3&#x2013;1, including two blowout losses. James responded by registering back-to-back 41 point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination. In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including a memorable chase-down block on <a href="/wiki/Andre_Iguodala" title="Andre Iguodala">Andre Iguodala</a> in the final two minutes, as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the <a href="/wiki/Cleveland_sports_curse" title="Cleveland sports curse">city&apos;s first professional sports title in 52 years</a>. James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7, and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game, he became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round and was unanimously voted the Finals MVP.</p>

<p>James made his debut for the <a href="/wiki/United_States_men%27s_national_basketball_team" title="United States men&apos;s national basketball team">United States national team</a> at the <a href="/wiki/2004_United_States_men%27s_Olympic_basketball_team" title="2004 United States men&apos;s Olympic basketball team">2004 Olympics</a> in <a href="/wiki/Athens" title="Athens">Athens, Greece</a>. He spent the Games mostly on the bench, averaging 14.6 minutes per game with 5.8 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in eight games. Team USA finished the competition with a bronze medal, becoming the first U.S. basketball team to return home without a gold medal since adding professionals to their line-up. James felt his limited playing time was a &quot;lowlight&quot; and believed he was not given &quot;a fair opportunity to play&quot;. His attitude during the Olympics was described as &quot;disrespectful&quot; and &quot;distasteful&quot; by columnists <a href="/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski" title="Adrian Wojnarowski">Adrian Wojnarowski</a> and <a href="/wiki/Peter_Vecsey_(sports_columnist)" title="Peter Vecsey (sports columnist)">Peter Vecsey</a>, respectively.</p>
<p>At the <a href="/wiki/2006_FIBA_World_Championship" title="2006 FIBA World Championship">2006 FIBA World Championship</a> in <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>, James took on a greater role for Team USA, averaging 13.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game as co-captain. The team finished the tournament with an 8&#x2013;1 record, winning another bronze medal. James&apos; behavior was again questioned, this time by teammate <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Bowen" title="Bruce Bowen">Bruce Bowen</a>, who confronted James during tryouts regarding his treatment of staff members.</p>
<p>Before naming James to the <a href="/wiki/2008_United_States_men%27s_Olympic_basketball_team" title="2008 United States men&apos;s Olympic basketball team">2008 Olympic team</a>, Team USA managing director <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Colangelo" title="Jerry Colangelo">Jerry Colangelo</a> and coach <a href="/wiki/Mike_Krzyzewski" title="Mike Krzyzewski">Mike Krzyzewski</a> gave James an ultimatum to improve his attitude, and he heeded their advice. At the <a href="/wiki/FIBA_Americas_Championship_2007" class="mw-redirect" title="FIBA Americas Championship 2007">FIBA Americas Championship 2007</a>, he averaged 18.1 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game, including a 31-point performance against Argentina in the championship game, the most ever by an American in an Olympic qualifier. Team USA went 10&#x2013;0, winning the gold medal and qualifying for the <a href="/wiki/2008_Olympics" class="mw-redirect" title="2008 Olympics">2008 Olympics</a> in <a href="/wiki/Beijing" title="Beijing">Beijing, China</a>. James credited the team&apos;s attitude and experience for their improvement, saying: &quot;I don&apos;t think we understood what it meant to put on a USA uniform and all the people that we were representing in 2004. We definitely know that now.&quot; At the Olympics, Team USA went unbeaten, winning their first gold medal since <a href="/wiki/2000_Olympics" class="mw-redirect" title="2000 Olympics">2000</a>. In the final game, James turned in 14 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists against Spain.</p>
<p>James did not play at the <a href="/wiki/2010_United_States_men%27s_FIBA_World_Championship_team" title="2010 United States men&apos;s FIBA World Championship team">2010 FIBA World Championship</a> but rejoined Team USA for the <a href="/wiki/2012_United_States_men%27s_Olympic_basketball_team" title="2012 United States men&apos;s Olympic basketball team">2012 Olympics</a> in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London, England</a>. He became the leader of the team with <a href="/wiki/Kobe_Bryant" title="Kobe Bryant">Kobe Bryant</a>, who would soon be 34, stepping back. James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed. During a game against <a href="/wiki/Australia_men%27s_national_basketball_team" title="Australia men&apos;s national basketball team">Australia</a>, he recorded the first triple-double in U.S. Olympic basketball history with 11 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists. Team USA went on to win their second straight gold medal, again defeating Spain in the final game. James contributed 19 points in the win, becoming the all-time leading scorer in U.S. men&apos;s basketball history. He also joined Michael Jordan as the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA championship, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold medal in the same year. Afterwards, Krzyzewski said James &quot;is the best player, he is the best leader and he is as smart as anybody playing the game right now.&quot;</p>

James drives to the basket in March 2008. A deft finisher, he led the NBA in scoring and shooting percentage at the rim in 2013.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Standing at 6&#xA0;feet 8&#xA0;inches (2.03&#xA0;m) and weighing 250 pounds (113.4&#xA0;kg), James has started at <a href="/wiki/Small_forward" title="Small forward">small forward</a> and <a href="/wiki/Power_forward_(basketball)" title="Power forward (basketball)">power forward</a>, but can also play the other three positions. With career averages of 27.5 points, 7.2 rebounds, 6.9 assists, and 1.7 steals per game, he is considered one of the most athletic and versatile players in the NBA, and has been compared to Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan. Since 2011, he has been ranked the best player in the NBA by ESPN and <i>Sports Illustrated</i>.</p>
<p>Many basketball analysts, coaches, fans, and current and former players consider James to be one of the greatest players of all-time, often ranking him as the best small forward and in the top five overall. He has earned All-NBA honors every season since his sophomore year, All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014, and was named Rookie of the Year in his debut season. With four MVP awards, he is part of a select group of players who have won the award four times, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, and <a href="/wiki/Bill_Russell" title="Bill Russell">Bill Russell</a>; only he and Russell have won four MVP awards in a five-year span. While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Offense">Offense</span></h3>
<p>James entered the NBA at an early age and made an immediate offensive impact; he holds numerous &quot;youngest to&quot; distinctions including being the youngest player to score 25,000 career points. During his first term with the Cavaliers, he was used as an on-ball <a href="/wiki/Point_forward" title="Point forward">point forward</a>, and although his shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented, he established himself as one of the best <a href="/wiki/Slasher_(basketball)" title="Slasher (basketball)">slashers</a> and finishers in basketball, leading the NBA in <a href="/wiki/Three-point_play" title="Three-point play">three point plays</a> in 2006. Around this time, he was frequently criticized for not having developed a reliable <a href="/wiki/Jump_shot_(basketball)" title="Jump shot (basketball)">jump shot</a> or post game, areas he improved in Miami, where Heat coach <a href="/wiki/Erik_Spoelstra" title="Erik Spoelstra">Erik Spoelstra</a> changed James&apos; role to a more unconventional one. James began spending more time in the post and shooting fewer three-pointers, attempting a career-low 149 in 2012. He improved his shot selection and accuracy on jump shots, finishing second in the league in catch-and-shoot field goal percentage in 2013. He also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the Heat&apos;s &quot;pass-happy&quot; offense. During this period, ESPN&apos;s Tom Haberstroh has called James&apos; free throw shooting his biggest weakness, describing it as &quot;average&quot;. Upon returning to the Cavaliers, James began to experience subtle age-related declines in productivity, posting his lowest scoring averages since his rookie season in 2015 and 2016. His shooting also regressed, and he briefly ranked as the worst high-volume outside shooter from outside the paint in the NBA.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, James&apos; playmaking ability has been praised; in one article, Grantland&apos;s Zach Lowe called him &quot;one of the greatest passers ever&quot;. Using his size, vision, and the attention he garners from opposing defenses to his advantage, James is able to create easy points for his teammates with accurate assists, manufacturing a league leading 2.6 three-pointers per game by way of his passing alone in 2013.</p>
<p>Early in James&apos; career, he was criticized by the media for his play in pressure situations; specifically, for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games. In a 2011 interview, teammate Chris Bosh stated that he would rather have Dwyane Wade take a last-second shot than James. Later in James&apos; career, his clutch play was viewed more favorably; for example, a 2011 article by Henry Abbott revealed that James had a better shooting percentage with the game on the line than such notables as <a href="/wiki/Ray_Allen" title="Ray Allen">Ray Allen</a> and Kobe Bryant. In 2015, <a href="/wiki/FiveThirtyEight" title="FiveThirtyEight">FiveThirtyEight</a> wrote that he might be &quot;the most clutch playoff shooter of his generation&quot;.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Defense">Defense</span></h3>
<p>At the beginning of James&apos; career, he was considered a poor defensive player, but improved steadily through the years. Near the end of his first tenure in Cleveland, he became proficient at the chase-down block; coming in from behind the opposition in transition to block their shot. In Miami, he developed into a more versatile defender, and the Heat relied on him to guard all five positions. Paired with teammates <a href="/wiki/Shane_Battier" title="Shane Battier">Shane Battier</a> and Dwyane Wade, Miami used James in an ultra-aggressive defensive scheme, with James cheating off the ball to help out inside or get into rebounding position. In 2014, James was criticized for having a down defensive season, stemming from a lack of effort and a tendency for &quot;coasting&quot;.</p>

<p>James proposed to Savannah Brinson, his high school sweetheart, on December 31, 2011 at a party celebrating New Year&apos;s Eve and his 27th birthday. The two were married on September 14, 2013 in San Diego. Together, they have three children: LeBron James Jr. (born October 6, 2004), Bryce Maximus James (born June 14, 2007), and Zhuri James. During his tenure with the Heat, James resided in <a href="/wiki/Coconut_Grove" title="Coconut Grove">Coconut Grove</a>, an affluent Miami neighborhood, where he bought a three-story mansion overlooking <a href="/wiki/Biscayne_Bay" title="Biscayne Bay">Biscayne Bay</a> for $9&#xA0;million. In November 2015, James bought a 9,350 square-feet East Coast-style mansion in <a href="/wiki/Brentwood,_Los_Angeles" title="Brentwood, Los Angeles">Brentwood, Los Angeles</a>, for about $21&#xA0;million.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Business_interests">Business interests</span></h3>
<p>James is represented by agent <a href="/wiki/Rich_Paul" title="Rich Paul">Rich Paul</a> of Klutch Sports. His first agent was <a href="/wiki/Aaron_Goodwin" title="Aaron Goodwin">Aaron Goodwin</a>, whom he left in 2005 for <a href="/wiki/Leon_Rose" title="Leon Rose">Leon Rose</a>. Rose joined <a href="/wiki/Creative_Artists_Agency" title="Creative Artists Agency">Creative Artists Agency</a> (CAA) in 2007, and he worked with fellow CAA agent <a href="/wiki/Henry_Thomas" title="Henry Thomas">Henry Thomas</a>, who represented Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, to bring James to Miami in 2010. James left CAA for Paul in 2012. James, Paul, Maverick Carter, and Randy Mims&#x2014;all childhood friends&#x2014;formed agent and sports-marketing company LRMR after James left Goodwin. LRMR handles James&apos; marketing, including the marketing of <i>The Decision</i>, for which it was criticized.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, James has taken a unique approach to his playing contracts, usually opting to sign shorter term deals in order to maximize his earnings potential and flexibility. In 2006, he and the Cavaliers negotiated a three-year, $60&#xA0;million contract extension. This was instead of the four year maximum length as it allotted James the option of seeking a new contract worth more money as an unrestricted free agent following the 2010 season. In 2014, he rejoined Cleveland on a two-year contract worth $42.1 million with an option to become a free agent again in 2015. The next offseason, he opted out of the contract and re-signed with the Cavaliers on another two-year contract with a player option for the second year. Analysts have speculated that James is opting out and re-signing on new contracts after each season in order to take advantage of higher salaries resulting from the NBA&apos;s rising salary cap.</p>
<p>James has numerous endorsement contracts; some of the companies he does business with are <a href="/wiki/Audemars_Piguet" title="Audemars Piguet">Audemars Piguet</a>, <a href="/wiki/Coca-Cola" title="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dunkin%27_Brands" title="Dunkin&apos; Brands">Dunkin&apos; Brands</a>, <a href="/wiki/McDonald%27s" title="McDonald&apos;s">McDonald&apos;s</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nike,_Inc." title="Nike, Inc.">Nike</a>, <a href="/wiki/State_Farm" class="mw-redirect" title="State Farm">State Farm</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Samsung" title="Samsung">Samsung</a>. Coming out of high school, he was the target of a three-way bidding war among Nike, <a href="/wiki/Reebok" title="Reebok">Reebok</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Adidas" title="Adidas">Adidas</a>, eventually signing with Nike for approximately $90 million. His signature shoes have performed well for Nike, and in 2013 he led all NBA players in shoe sales. In 2011, <a href="/wiki/Fenway_Sports_Group" title="Fenway Sports Group">Fenway Sports Group</a> became the sole global marketer of his rights, and as part of the deal, he was granted a minority stake in the English <a href="/wiki/Premier_League" title="Premier League">Premier League</a> football club <a href="/wiki/Liverpool_FC" class="mw-redirect" title="Liverpool FC">Liverpool FC</a>, who he has claimed his support for. As a result of James&apos; endorsement money and NBA salary, he has been listed as one of the world&apos;s highest-paid athletes. In 2013, he surpassed Kobe Bryant as the highest paid basketball player in the world with earnings of $56.5 million. In 2015 he was ranked the sixth highest earning sportsperson, and third highest in 2016 (after <a href="/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo" title="Cristiano Ronaldo">Ronaldo</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lionel_Messi" title="Lionel Messi">Messi</a>). In 2014, James realized a profit of more than $30 million as part of <a href="/wiki/Apple_Inc." title="Apple Inc.">Apple</a>&apos;s acquisition of <a href="/wiki/Beats_Electronics" title="Beats Electronics">Beats Electronics</a>; he had originally struck a deal to get a small stake in the company at its inception in exchange for promoting its headphones.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Public_image">Public image</span></h3>
<p>James is considered by many, including his fellow players, to be the &quot;face of the NBA&quot;. His opinions have yielded significant influence on important league decisions; for example, in 2014 he asked commissioner <a href="/wiki/Adam_Silver" title="Adam Silver">Adam Silver</a> to increase the duration of the All-Star break, and the request was granted the following season. On February 13, 2015, James was elected the first Vice President of the <a href="/wiki/National_Basketball_Players_Association" title="National Basketball Players Association">National Basketball Players Association</a> (NBPA).</p>
<p>James has been ranked by <i>Forbes</i> as one of the world&apos;s most influential athletes throughout his career. During his first tenure with the Cavaliers, he was adored by local fans, with <a href="/wiki/Sherwin-Williams" title="Sherwin-Williams">Sherwin-Williams</a> displaying a giant Nike-produced banner of James on its world headquarters. Despite their affection for James, Cleveland fans and critics were frequently annoyed when he attended <a href="/wiki/Cleveland_Indians" title="Cleveland Indians">Cleveland Indians</a> games against the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Yankees" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a> dressed in a Yankees hat. Following his actions during the 2010 free agency period and, more specifically, <i>The Decision</i>, he was listed as one of the world&apos;s most disliked athletes. By 2013, his image had mostly recovered and he was reported by ESPN as the most popular player in the NBA for the second time in his career. In 2014, he was named the most popular male athlete in America by the Harris Poll. He has led the league in jersey sales six times.</p>
