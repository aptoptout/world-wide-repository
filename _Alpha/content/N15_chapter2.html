<p><b>Father&apos;s Day</b> is a celebration honoring fathers and celebrating fatherhood, paternal bonds, and the influence of fathers in society. In Catholic Europe, it has been celebrated on 19 March (<a href="/w/index.php?title=St.Joseph%27s_Day&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="St.Joseph&apos;s Day (page does not exist)">St.Joseph&apos;s Day</a>) since the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>. This celebration was brought by the Spanish and Portuguese to Latin America, where 19 March is often still used for it, though many countries in Europe and the Americas have adopted the US date which is the third Sunday of June. In the US, Father&apos;s Day has been celebrated since the early twentieth century.</p>

<p>A customary day for the celebration of fatherhood in Catholic Europe is known to date back to at least the Middle Ages, and it is observed on 19th March, as the feast day of Saint Joseph, who is referred to as the fatherly <i>Nutritor Domini</i> (&quot;Nourisher of the Lord&quot;) in Catholicism and &quot;the putative father of Jesus&quot; in southern European tradition. This celebration was brought to the Americas by the Spanish and Portuguese, and in Latin America, Father&apos;s Day is still celebrated on 19 March. The <a href="/wiki/Catholic_church" class="mw-redirect" title="Catholic church">Catholic church</a> actively supported the custom of a celebration of fatherhood on St. Joseph&apos;s day from either the last years of the 14th Century or from the early 15th Century, apparently on the initiative of the <a href="/wiki/Franciscans" title="Franciscans">Franciscans</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Coptic_Orthodox_Church_of_Alexandria" title="Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria">Coptic Church</a>, the celebration of fatherhood is also observed on St Joseph&apos;s Day, but the Copts observe this celebration on the 20th of July. This Coptic celebration may date back to the 5th Century.</p>

<p>Father&apos;s Day was not celebrated in the US, outside Catholic traditions, until the twentieth century.

<p>After <a href="/wiki/Anna_Jarvis" title="Anna Jarvis">Anna Jarvis</a>&apos; successful promotion of Mother&apos;s Day in <a href="/wiki/Grafton,_West_Virginia" title="Grafton, West Virginia">Grafton, West Virginia</a>, the first observance of a &quot;Father&apos;s Day&quot; was held on July 5, 1908, in <a href="/wiki/Fairmont,_West_Virginia" title="Fairmont, West Virginia">Fairmont, West Virginia</a>, in the Williams Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church South, now known as Central <a href="/wiki/United_Methodist" class="mw-redirect" title="United Methodist">United Methodist</a> Church. Grace Golden Clayton was mourning the loss of her father, when in December 1907, the <a href="/wiki/Monongah_Mining_Disaster" class="mw-redirect" title="Monongah Mining Disaster">Monongah Mining Disaster</a> in nearby <a href="/wiki/Monongah,_West_Virginia" title="Monongah, West Virginia">Monongah</a> killed 361 men, 250 of them fathers, leaving around a thousand fatherless children. Clayton suggested that her pastor Robert Thomas Webb honor all those fathers.</p>
<p>Clayton&apos;s event did not have repercussions outside Fairmont for several reasons, among them: the city was overwhelmed by other events, the celebration was never promoted outside the town itself and no proclamation of it was made by the city council. Also, two events overshadowed this event: the celebration of <a href="/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)" title="Independence Day (United States)">Independence Day</a> July 4, 1908, with 12,000 attendants and several shows including a hot air balloon event, which took over the headlines in the following days, and the death of a 16-year-old girl on July 4. The local church and council were overwhelmed and they did not even think of promoting the event, and it was not celebrated again for many years. The original sermon was not reproduced by the press and it was lost. Finally, Clayton was a quiet person, who never promoted the event and never talked to other persons about it.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Failed_attempts_at_establishing_a_Father.27s_Day">Failed attempts at establishing a Father&apos;s Day</span></h4>
<p>In 1911, <a href="/wiki/Jane_Addams" title="Jane Addams">Jane Addams</a> proposed that a city-wide Father&apos;s Day celebration be held in <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, but she was turned down.</p>
<p>In 1912, there was a Father&apos;s Day celebration in <a href="/wiki/Vancouver,_Washington" title="Vancouver, Washington">Vancouver, Washington</a>, suggested by Methodist pastor J. J. Berringer of the Irvington Methodist Church. They mistakenly believed that they had been the first to celebrate such a day. They followed a 1911 suggestion by the <i><a href="/wiki/Portland_Oregonian" class="mw-redirect" title="Portland Oregonian">Portland Oregonian</a></i>.</p>
<p>Harry C. Meek, a member of <a href="/wiki/Lions_Clubs_International" title="Lions Clubs International">Lions Clubs International</a>, claimed that he had first come up with the idea for Father&apos;s Day in 1915. Meek said that the third Sunday in June was chosen because it was his birthday. The Lions Club has named him the &quot;Originator of Father&apos;s Day&quot;. Meek made many efforts to promote Father&apos;s Day and make it an official holiday.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Establishment_of_the_holiday">Establishment of the holiday</span></h4>
<p>In 1972, a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.coloringpages-biographies.com/happy-fathers-day-free-coloring-pages-sheets-printables.html">Father&apos;s Day</a> celebration was held in <a href="/wiki/Spokane,_Washington" title="Spokane, Washington">Spokane, Washington</a>, at the <a href="/wiki/YMCA" title="YMCA">YMCA</a> by <a href="/wiki/Sonora_Smart_Dodd" title="Sonora Smart Dodd">Sonora Smart Dodd</a>, who was born in <a href="/wiki/Arkansas" title="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>. Its first celebration was held at the Spokane YMCA on June 19, 1910. Her father, the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">civil war</a> veteran <a href="/wiki/William_Jackson_Smart" class="mw-redirect" title="William Jackson Smart">William Jackson Smart</a>, was a single parent who raised his six children there. After hearing a <a href="/wiki/Sermon" title="Sermon">sermon</a> about Jarvis&apos; Mother&apos;s Day in 1909 at Central Methodist Episcopal Church, she told her <a href="/wiki/Elder_(Methodism)" class="mw-redirect" title="Elder (Methodism)">pastor</a> that fathers should have a similar holiday to honor them. Although she initially suggested June 5, her father&apos;s birthday, the pastors did not have enough time to prepare their sermons, and the celebration was deferred to the third Sunday in June. Several local clergymen accepted the idea, and on June 19, 1910, the first Father&apos;s Day, &quot;sermons honoring fathers were presented throughout the city.&quot;</p>
<p>However, in the 1920s, Dodd stopped promoting the celebration because she was studying at the <a href="/wiki/Art_Institute_of_Chicago" title="Art Institute of Chicago">Art Institute of Chicago</a>, and it faded into relative obscurity, even in Spokane. In the 1930s, Dodd returned to Spokane and started promoting the celebration again, raising awareness at a national level. She had the help of those trade groups that would benefit most from the holiday, for example the manufacturers of ties, tobacco pipes, and any traditional present for fathers. By 1938 she had the help of the Father&apos;s Day Council, founded by the New York Associated Men&apos;s Wear Retailers in order to consolidate and systematize the holiday&apos;s commercial promotion. Americans resisted the holiday for its first few decades, viewing it as nothing more than an attempt by merchants to replicate the commercial success of Mother&apos;s Day, and newspapers frequently featured cynical and sarcastic attacks and jokes. However, the said merchants remained resilient and even incorporated these attacks into their advertisements. By the mid-1980s, the Father&apos;s Day Council wrote that &quot;(...) [Father&apos;s Day] has become a Second Christmas for all the men&apos;s gift-oriented industries.&quot;</p>
<p>A bill to accord national recognition of the holiday was introduced in Congress in 1913. In 1916, President <a href="/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> went to Spokane to speak at a Father&apos;s Day celebration and he wanted to make it an officially-recognized federal holiday, but Congress resisted, fearing that it would become commercialized. US President <a href="/wiki/Calvin_Coolidge" title="Calvin Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a> recommended in 1924 that the day be observed throughout the entire nation, but he stopped short at issuing a national proclamation. Two earlier attempts to formally recognize the holiday had been defeated by Congress. In 1957, Maine Senator <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Chase_Smith" title="Margaret Chase Smith">Margaret Chase Smith</a> wrote a Father&apos;s Day proposal accusing Congress of ignoring fathers for 40 years while honoring mothers, thus &quot;[singling] out just one of our two parents&quot;. In 1966, President <a href="/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson" title="Lyndon B. Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> issued the first presidential proclamation honoring fathers, designating the third Sunday in June as Father&apos;s Day. Six years later, the day was made a permanent national holiday when President <a href="/wiki/Richard_Nixon" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> signed it into law in 1972.</p>
<p>In addition to Father&apos;s Day, <a href="/wiki/International_Men%27s_Day" title="International Men&apos;s Day">International Men&apos;s Day</a> is celebrated in many countries on November 19 in honor of men and boys who are not fathers.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Spelling">Spelling</span></h2>
<p>In the United States, Dodd used the &quot;Fathers&apos; Day&quot; spelling on her original petition for the holiday, but the spelling &quot;Father&apos;s Day&quot; was already used in 1913 when a bill was introduced to the U.S. Congress as the first attempt to establish the holiday, and it was still spelled the same way when its creator was commended in 2008 by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Congress" title="United States Congress">U.S. Congress</a>.</p>

<p>The officially recognized date of Father&apos;s Day varies from country to country. This section lists some significant examples, in order of date of observance.</p>

<p>*Officially, as the name suggests, the holiday celebrates people who are serving or were serving the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces" title="Russian Armed Forces">Russian Armed Forces</a> (both men and women). But the congratulations are traditionally, nationally accepted by all fathers, other adult men and male children as well.<br>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Germany">Germany</span></h3>
<p>In Germany, Father&apos;s Day (<i>Vatertag</i>) is celebrated differently from other parts of the world. It is always celebrated on <a href="/wiki/Ascension_Day" class="mw-redirect" title="Ascension Day">Ascension Day</a> (the Thursday forty days after Easter), which is a federal holiday. Regionally, it is also called men&apos;s day, <i>M&#xE4;nnertag</i>, or gentlemen&apos;s day, <i>Herrentag</i>. It is tradition for groups of males (young and old but usually excluding pre-teenage boys) to do a hiking tour with one or more smaller wagons, <i><a href="//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollerwagen" class="extiw" title="de:Bollerwagen">Bollerwagen</a></i>, pulled by manpower. In the wagons are wine or beer (according to region) and traditional regional food, <i><a href="//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausmannskost" class="extiw" title="de:Hausmannskost">Hausmannskost</a></i>.

According to the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Statistical_Office_of_Germany" title="Federal Statistical Office of Germany">Federal Statistical Office of Germany</a>, alcohol-related traffic accidents multiply by three on this day.

In the late 19th century the religious component was progressively lost, especially in urban areas such as Berlin, and groups of men organized walking excursions with beer and ham. By the 20th century, alcohol consumption had become a major part of the tradition. Many people will take the following Friday off at work, and some schools are closed on that Friday as well; many people then use the resulting four-day-long weekend for a short vacation.</p>

In Latvia people did not always celebrate this day because of the USSR&apos;s influence with its own holidays. This day in Latvia was &apos;officially born&apos; in 2008 when it was celebrated and marked in the calendar for the first time on September 14 (second September Sunday) to promote the idea that man as the father must be satisfied and proud of his family and children, also, the father is important to gratitude and loving words from his family for devoted to continuous altruistic concerns. Because this day is new to the country it does not have established unique traditions, but people borrow ideas from other country&apos;s Father&apos;s Day traditions to congratulate fathers in Latvia.</p>
