Today, Colt uses &quot;AR-15&quot; for its <a href="/wiki/Semi-automatic_firearm" title="Semi-automatic firearm">semi-automatic</a> civilian rifles and thus many use the term only for Colt AR-15s and clones made by other manufacturers.

The AR-15 was developed as a lighter <a href="/wiki/5.56%C3%9745mm_NATO" title="5.56&#xD7;45mm NATO">5.56 mm</a> version of the AR-10. The &quot;AR&quot; in all ArmaLite pattern firearms simply stands for &quot;ArmaLite Rifle&quot; and can be found on most of the company&apos;s firearms: <a href="/wiki/Armalite_AR-5" title="Armalite AR-5">AR-5</a>, a .22 caliber rifle; the <a href="/wiki/AR-7" class="mw-redirect" title="AR-7">AR-7</a>, another .22 caliber; the <a href="/w/index.php?title=AR-17&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="AR-17 (page does not exist)">AR-17</a> shotgun; the AR-10 rifle; and the <a href="/wiki/AR-24" class="mw-redirect" title="AR-24">AR-24</a> pistol.</p><p>In 1959, ArmaLite sold its rights to the AR-10 and AR-15 to <a href="/wiki/Colt%27s_Manufacturing_Company" title="Colt&apos;s Manufacturing Company">Colt</a>. After a tour by Colt of the Far East, the first sale of AR-15s was made to <a href="/wiki/Federation_of_Malaya" title="Federation of Malaya">Malaya</a> on September 30, 1959. Colt manufactured their first 300 AR-15s in December 1959. Colt marketed the AR-15 rifle to various military services around the world. After modifications (most notably the relocation of the <a href="/wiki/Charging_handle" class="mw-redirect" title="Charging handle">charging handle</a> from under the carrying handle to the rear of the receiver), the redesigned rifle was adopted by the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> military as the <a href="/wiki/M16_rifle" title="M16 rifle">M16 rifle</a>.</p><p>In 1963, Colt started selling the <a href="/wiki/Semi-automatic_firearm" title="Semi-automatic firearm">semi-automatic</a> version of the M16 rifle as the Colt AR-15 for civilian use and the term has been used to refer to semiautomatic-only versions of the rifle since then. Colt continued to use the AR-15 trademark for its semi-automatic variants (AR-15, AR-15A2) that were marketed to civilian and law-enforcement customers. The original AR-15 was a very lightweight weapon, weighing less than 6 pounds with empty magazine. Later heavy-barrel versions of the civilian AR-15 can weigh upwards of 8.5&#xA0;lb.</p><p>The 1986 <a href="/wiki/Firearm_Owners_Protection_Act" title="Firearm Owners Protection Act">Firearm Owners Protection Act</a> (FOPA) redefined the term <i><a href="/wiki/Machine_gun" title="Machine gun">machine gun</a></i> to include individual gun components with which a semi-automatic firearm can be converted to full-automatic, based on a 1981 ATF ruling on machine gun parts.</p><p>In 1993, the bolt carrier groups used in civilian AR-15 type rifles began to employ additional measures to prevent modification to full auto.</p><p>Today, the AR-15 and its variations are manufactured by many companies and are popular among civilian shooters and law enforcement forces around the world due to their accuracy and modularity.</p><p>Some notable features of the AR-15 include:</p><p>Military (automatic) variants have a three-position rotating <a href="/wiki/Selective_fire" title="Selective fire">selective fire</a> switch, allowing the operator to select between three modes: safe, semi-automatic and either automatic or three-round burst, depending on model.</p><p>Civilian AR-15s support only semi-automatic (one shot per trigger pull) fire. They do not have three-round burst or automatic settings; they can only operate as a semi-automatic and are therefore not <a href="/wiki/Selective_fire" title="Selective fire">selective fire</a> weapons.</p><p>The Colt mode switch toggles between safe (safety on) and semi-automatic modes. Some other manufacturers may mark their rifles with full automatic and three-round mode positions (for collectors and <a href="/wiki/Historical_reenactment" title="Historical reenactment">re-enactors</a>) although these settings have no effect.</p><p>Civilian models are internally different from the M16, although nearly identical in external appearance. The hammer and trigger mechanisms are of a different design. The firing mechanism (bolt carrier and internal lower receiver) of semi-automatic versions is milled differently, so that they are not interchangeable with M16s. The design was intended to satisfy United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (<a href="/wiki/Bureau_of_Alcohol,_Tobacco,_Firearms_and_Explosives" title="Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives">ATF</a>) requirements that civilian weapons not be easily convertible to full-automatic. The full automatic M16 bolt carrier is the most popular type and is approved by ATF.</p><p>Civilian models can no longer be legally modified to full automatic. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, conversion to full automatic was straightforward, using items such as the &quot;Drop In Auto Sear&quot; or &quot;lightning link&quot;. In some cases such conversion required machining the lower receiver with a mill, as well as the substitution of a M16 bolt carrier group. Modified weapons did not thereby become able to switch between the three modes of the military model. The latter required a special full automatic fire select mechanism and a modified selector-switch. Many AR-15&apos;s made before 1986 were converted to M16s by gunsmiths who legally, producing Form One rifles. A converted AR has an auto sear in a lower receiver marked as an AR-15.</p><p>Today, the civilian manufacture, sale and possession of post-1986 select-fire AR-15 variants is prohibited. However, it is legal to sell templates, tooling and manuals to conduct such conversion. These items are typically marketed as &quot;post-sample&quot; materials for Federal Firearm Licensees. They may be used to manufacture select-fire variants of the AR-15 for sale to law enforcement, military and overseas customers.</p><p>FOPA redefined the definition of a machine gun to include individual components with which a semi-automatic firearm can be converted to full-automatic (based on a 1981 ATF ruling on machine gun parts). Since 1993, the bolt carrier groups used in AR-15 type rifles for civilians have employed additional measures to prevent modification to full auto. Colt AR-15&apos;s use a metal alloy wall to separate the fire control group from the sear, preventing use of full automatic parts.</p><p><span><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="//www.google.com/patents/US2951424">U.S. Patent 2,951,424</a></span> describes the cycling mechanism used in the AR-15. The bolt carrier acts as a movable cylinder and the bolt itself acts as a stationary piston. This mechanism is often called &quot;<a href="/wiki/Direct_impingement" title="Direct impingement">direct gas impingement</a>&quot; (DGI), although it differs from prior gas systems.</p><p>Gas is tapped from the barrel as the bullet moves past a gas port located above the rifle&apos;s front sight base. The gas expands into the port and down a gas tube, located above the barrel that runs from the front sight base into the AR-15&apos;s upper receiver. Here, the gas tube protrudes into a &quot;gas key&quot; (bolt carrier key), which accepts the gas and funnels it into the bolt carrier.</p><p>At this point, the bolt is locked into the barrel extension by locking lugs, so the expanding gas forces the bolt carrier backward a short distance. As the bolt carrier moves toward the butt of the gun, the bolt cam pin, riding in a slot on the bolt carrier, <a href="/wiki/Rotating_bolt" title="Rotating bolt">forces the bolt to rotate and thus unlocks it</a> from the barrel extension. Once the bolt is fully unlocked it begins its rearward movement along with the bolt carrier. The bolt&apos;s rearward motion extracts the empty cartridge case from the chamber. As soon as the neck of the case clears the barrel extension, the bolt&apos;s spring-loaded ejector forces it out the ejection port in the side of the upper receiver.</p><p>Behind the bolt carrier is a plastic or metal buffer, which rests in line with a return spring. The buffer spring begins to push the bolt carrier and bolt back toward the chamber once it is compressed sufficiently. A groove machined into the upper receiver guides the bolt cam pin and prevents it and the bolt from rotating into a closed position. The bolt&apos;s locking lugs push a fresh round from the magazine as the bolt moves forward. The round is guided by feed ramps into the chamber. As the bolt&apos;s locking lugs move past the barrel extension, the cam pin twists into a pocket milled into the upper receiver. This twisting action follows the groove cut into the carrier and forces the bolt to twist and &quot;lock&quot; into the barrel extension.</p><p>The AR-15 rifle is available in a wide range of configurations from a large number of manufacturers. These configurations range from short carbine-length models with features such as adjustable length stocks and optical sights, to heavy barrel models.</p><p>The AR-15 employs a modular design. Thus one upper receiver can quickly and easily be substituted for another from the aftermarket. Many aftermarket upper <a href="/wiki/Receiver_(firearms)" title="Receiver (firearms)">receivers</a> are available that incorporate barrels of different weights, lengths and calibers. Available calibers include the <a href="/wiki/.223_Remington" title=".223 Remington">.223 Remington</a>/<a href="/wiki/5.56%C3%9745mm_NATO" title="5.56&#xD7;45mm NATO">5.56&#xD7;45mm</a>, <a href="/wiki/.300_Blackout" class="mw-redirect" title=".300 Blackout">.300 Blackout</a>, <a href="/wiki/7.62%C3%9739mm" title="7.62&#xD7;39mm">7.62&#xD7;39mm</a>, <a href="/wiki/5.45%C3%9739mm" title="5.45&#xD7;39mm">5.45&#xD7;39mm</a>, <a href="/wiki/.45_ACP" title=".45 ACP">.45 ACP</a>, <a href="/wiki/5.7%C3%9728mm" class="mw-redirect" title="5.7&#xD7;28mm">5.7&#xD7;28mm</a>, <a href="/wiki/6.5mm_Grendel" title="6.5mm Grendel">6.5mm Grendel</a>, <a href="/wiki/6.8mm_Remington_SPC" title="6.8mm Remington SPC">6.8mm Remington SPC</a>, <a href="/wiki/.50_Beowulf" title=".50 Beowulf">.50 Beowulf</a> and <a href="/wiki/.458_SOCOM" title=".458 SOCOM">.458 SOCOM</a>.</p><p>When installing a complete upper receiver, particularly one designed to handle a different caliber, the lower receiver may also require modification. For example, conversion to 9&#xA0;mm ammunition typically typically involves the installation of a magazine well block (to accommodate a typical 9&#xA0;mm magazine, such as <a href="/wiki/Uzi" title="Uzi">Uzi</a> or Colt SMG), replacing the .hammer and possibly replacing the buffer, action spring and stock spacer with 9mm-compatible components. The 9mm cartridge fires from an unlocked breech, or straight blow-back&#x2014;rather than a locked breech, because the spring and bolt provide enough weight to allow it. 9mm guns do not use direct gas impingement.</p><p>Some manufacturers offer upper and lower receivers machined from a solid billet (block) of aluminum as opposed to an aluminum forging. Forgings typically have a comparatively higher strength to weight ratio than billet-based receivers.</p><p>Upper receivers that combine a railed hand guard and upper receiver into one unit are made by companies like <a href="/wiki/Colt%27s_Manufacturing_Company" title="Colt&apos;s Manufacturing Company">Colt&apos;s Manufacturing Company</a>, Lewis Machine and Tool (LMT MRP), POF-USA and VLTOR. This provides a continuous rail section that runs along the top of the gun from the weapon&apos;s charging handle to the front sight/gas block. This rail section is used for the mounting of sights, laser aiming devices, night vision devices and lighting systems.</p><p>LAR Grizzly and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.blackwoodarms.com">Blackwood Arms</a> offer a side charging upper receiver. The charging handle can be had in a left side, right side or ambidextrous configuration. The side charging handle is attached to the bolt carrier, making it a reciprocating design. The handle can be used as a <a href="/wiki/Forward_assist" title="Forward assist">forward assist</a> device.</p><p>AR-15s such as the <a href="/wiki/Patriot_Ordnance_Factory" title="Patriot Ordnance Factory">POF</a>, <a href="/wiki/Land_Warfare_Resources_Corporation" class="mw-redirect" title="Land Warfare Resources Corporation">LWRCI</a>, <a href="/wiki/Heckler_%26_Koch" title="Heckler &amp; Koch">H&amp;K</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sturm_Ruger" class="mw-redirect" title="Sturm Ruger">Sturm Ruger</a>, <a href="/wiki/SIG_Sauer" title="SIG Sauer">SIG Sauer</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_Defense_Manufacturing_Corporation" title="United Defense Manufacturing Corporation">United Defense Manufacturing Corporation</a>, CMMG and Adams Arms offerings replace the DGI operating system with a short stroke/long stroke gas piston system. These guns usually have modified bolt carriers, gas keys and gas blocks. When fired, DGI systems send high pressure hot gas through the gas tube to the bolt carrier key and into the bolt carrier group. This can rapidly heat the bolt carrier group and cause fouling, one of the main design complaints. Gas piston operating systems alleviate these problems, but can cause issues such as carrier tilt, which can increase bolt fractures.</p><p>Early models had a 1:14 <a href="/wiki/Rifling" title="Rifling">rate of twist</a> for the original 55 grain (3.6 g) bullets. This was changed to 1:12 when it was found that in cold weather 1:14 was insufficient to stabilize the bullet. Most recent models have a 1:9 or 1:7 twist rate. The degree to which differing twist rates affect ballistics and terminal performance given varying loads is controversial, although heavier, longer projectiles tend to perform better with faster rifling rates. Additionally, the various each caliber has its own particular twist rate(s), such as 1:10, 1:11 and 1:12 for 6.8&#xD7;43mm SPC, 1:10 for 7.62&#xD7;39mm, 1:9 for the 6.5 Grendel and 1:8 for .300 Blackout.</p><p>Standard issue magazines are 20- or 30-round staggered-column <a href="/wiki/Magazine_(firearms)" title="Magazine (firearms)">magazines</a> and traditional box magazines exist in 40- and 45-round capacities.</p><p>Low-capacity magazines, usually of a 5- or 10-round capacity, are available to comply with some areas&apos; legal restrictions, for <a href="/wiki/Hunting" title="Hunting">hunting</a> and for benchrest shooting, where a larger magazine can be inconvenient.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Drum_magazine" title="Drum magazine">Drum magazines</a> may offer 90- and 100-round capacities, such as <a href="/wiki/Beta_C-Mag" title="Beta C-Mag">Beta C-Mags</a> and <a href="/wiki/Surefire" class="mw-redirect" title="Surefire">Surefire</a> (60- and 100-round configurations). These are of a staggered column design, dubbed <a href="/wiki/Casket_magazine" class="mw-redirect" title="Casket magazine">casket magazines</a> due to their shape. Usable magazines have been constructed from a variety of materials including steel, aluminum and high-impact plastics.</p><p>Most AR-15 rifles have a barrel threaded in 1&#x2044;2&quot;-28 threads to incorporate the use of a muzzle device such as a <a href="/wiki/Flash_suppressor" title="Flash suppressor">flash suppressor</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sound_suppressor" class="mw-redirect" title="Sound suppressor">sound suppressor</a> or <a href="/wiki/Muzzle_brake" title="Muzzle brake">muzzle brake</a>. The initial design had three tines or prongs and was prone to breakage and getting entangled in vegetation. The design was later changed to close the end to avoid this problem. Eventually, on the A2 version of the rifle, the bottom port was closed to reduce muzzle climb and prevent dust from rising when the rifle was fired in the prone position. For these reasons, the US military declared this muzzle device a compensator, but it is more commonly known as the &quot;GI&quot; or &quot;A2&quot; flash suppressor.</p><p>Flash suppressors are designed to reduce the muzzle flash from the weapon to preserve the shooter&apos;s night vision. A flash suppressor does not improve the ballistic performance of a rifle or make it more lethal. Some jurisdictions ban or severely restrict usage of flash suppressors. <a href="/wiki/Muzzle_brake" title="Muzzle brake">Muzzle brakes</a> or <a href="/wiki/Muzzle_brake" title="Muzzle brake">compensators</a> can provide a legal alternative.</p><p>The threaded barrel allows sound suppressors with the same thread pattern to be installed directly on the barrel. This can result in complications such as preventing the removal of the suppressor from the barrel. Some suppressor manufacturers offer &quot;direct-connect&quot; sound suppressors that can be installed over an existing flash suppressor as opposed to using the barrel&apos;s threads.</p><p>Multiple chambers are available. The civilian (SAAMI) specification supports .223 Remington rounds. The 5.56mm NATO chambers are designed for NATO rounds that are typically loaded to produce higher pressure than the .223. The external dimensions of the two cases are the same and internally the 5.56&#xD7;45mm case wall is identical to the .223.</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/.223_Wylde" title=".223 Wylde">Wylde chamber</a> is a hybrid chamber specification, designed by and named after Bill Wylde of <a href="/wiki/Greenup,_Illinois" title="Greenup, Illinois">Greenup, Illinois</a>. This chambering was designed to accurately shoot the military ball ammo of the day while still feeding reliably. Coincidentally, it shoots the longer 80 gr bullets commonly used in Highpower Rifle Competitions very well and is often preferred for that use. While the Wylde chamber allows for optimal seating depth of 80 grain bullets over .223 Remington and 5.56 NATO, it is capable of accepting the other ammunition types. The Wylde chamber is used by many manufacturers who sell &quot;National Match&quot; configurations. The type of chamber, manufacturer and rifling twist in inches is typically found stamped into the barrel in front of the front sight assembly.</p><p>A lightweight inertial firing pin rides in a channel inside the bolt unrestrained. When the bolt locks forward during loading, the firing pin typically rides forward and impacts the primer of the chambered round. In military specification (mil-spec) ammunition and quality civilian ammunition, this is not normally enough to fire the round and only leaves a small &quot;ding&quot; on the primer.</p><p>The AR-15 lower receiver can be used as a trigger mechanism for single shot or side-fed upper receivers for a variety of larger calibers, including <a href="/wiki/.50_BMG" title=".50 BMG">.50 BMG</a> and <a href="/wiki/Crossbow" title="Crossbow">crossbow</a> bolts.</p><p>Problems with M16s encountered by American soldiers in Vietnam affected the AR-15&apos;s reputation. At least part of the problems were due to the ammunition. Multiple propellants (powders) were tried, starting with IMR 4475 for the Army and WC 846 for the Air Force. WC 846 (a ball powder) tests showed experienced fouling and excessive cycle rates. Other powders showed problems, as well. M16s were issued without cleaning kits and many soldiers were not initially trained to use the M16s.</p><p>The direct gas impingement system can cause rapid overheating of the bolt carrier assembly with combustion residue gumming-up the action after firing as few as (200) rounds. This basic design flaw also renders the AR-15 unreliable except in &quot;range-clean&quot; condition. Sand, dirt, moisture - particularly, in the buffer tube region - can render the rifle a &quot;one-shot&quot;, dependent on the forward assist to return the bolt to battery.</p><p>One potential hazard is associated with chamber specifications. Firing NATO ammunition in civilian specification chambers can produce chamber pressures greater than the chamber is designed to handle. The most common related malfunction is that the primer can be forced out of the case by chamber pressure, often lodging the primer somewhere in the rifle action. Disassembly is often requirred to remove the jammed primer.</p><p>The use of more sensitive or improperly seated primers, this can cause a <a href="/wiki/Slamfire" title="Slamfire">slamfire</a> during loading. Another type of malfunction, <a href="/wiki/Firearm_malfunction#Hammer_follow" title="Firearm malfunction">hammer follow</a>, is also a potential problem for AR type rifles.</p>
