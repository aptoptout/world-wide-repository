The original etymology of this name is thought to have its roots in the once-dominant <a href="/wiki/Zoroastrian" class="mw-redirect" title="Zoroastrian">Zoroastrian</a> religion. In the <a href="/wiki/Avesta" title="Avesta">Avesta</a>, Frawardin <a href="/wiki/Yasht" title="Yasht">Yasht</a> (&quot;Hymn to the Guardian Angels&quot;), there is a mention of <i>&#xE2;terep&#xE2;tahe ashaon&#xF4; fravash&#xEE;m &#xFD;azamaide</i>, which literally translates from <a href="/wiki/Avestan_language" class="mw-redirect" title="Avestan language">Avestan</a> as &quot;we worship the <a href="/wiki/Fravashi" title="Fravashi">Fravashi</a> of the holy <a href="/wiki/Atropatene" title="Atropatene">Atropatene</a>.&quot;</p><p><a href="/wiki/Atropates" title="Atropates">Atropates</a> ruled over the region of <a href="/wiki/Atropatene" title="Atropatene">Atropatene</a> (present <a href="/wiki/Iranian_Azerbaijan" class="mw-redirect" title="Iranian Azerbaijan">Iranian Azerbaijan</a>). The name &quot;Atropates&quot; itself is the Greek transliteration of an Old Iranian, probably <a href="/wiki/Median_language" title="Median language">Median</a>, compounded name with the meaning &quot;Protected by the (Holy) Fire&quot; or &quot;The Land of the (Holy) Fire&quot;. The Greek name is mentioned by <a href="/wiki/Diodorus_Siculus" title="Diodorus Siculus">Diodorus Siculus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Strabo" title="Strabo">Strabo</a>. Over the span of millennia the name evolved to <i>&#x100;turp&#x101;t&#x101;k&#x101;n</i> (Middle Iranian) then to <i>&#x100;dharb&#x101;dhag&#x101;n</i>, <i>&#x100;dharb&#x101;yag&#x101;n</i>, <i>&#x100;zarb&#x101;ydj&#x101;n</i> (New Persian) and present-day <i>Azerbaijan</i>. In Armenia, the country is called <i>Adrbejan</i>, yet another archaic form. Ultimately, the name <i>Azerbaijan</i> comes from <i>Azar-Payegan</i>. This word is translatable as <i>Guardian of Fire</i>, &quot;The Treasury&quot; and &quot;The Treasurer&quot; of <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%A2%D8%B0%D8%B1#Persian" class="extiw" title="wikt:&#x622;&#x630;&#x631;">fire</a> or &quot;<a href="/wiki/The_Land_of_Fire" title="The Land of Fire">The Land of Fire</a>&quot; in <a href="/wiki/Persian_language" title="Persian language">Modern Persian</a>. The name was changed to <i>Azerbaijan</i> following the Arab conquest in the 7th century AD; <a href="/wiki/Arabic" title="Arabic">Arabic</a> lacked the letters <i>G</i> and <i>P</i>, so Arabic speakers modified the spelling of <i>Azer-payegan</i>.</p><p>The earliest evidence of human settlement in the territory of Azerbaijan dates back to the late <a href="/wiki/Stone_Age" title="Stone Age">Stone Age</a> and is related to the <a href="/wiki/Guruchay_culture" class="mw-redirect" title="Guruchay culture">Guruchay culture</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Azykh_Cave" title="Azykh Cave">Azykh Cave</a>.

The Medes forged a vast empire between 900&#x2013;700&#xA0;BC, which was integrated into the <a href="/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire" title="Achaemenid Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a> around 550&#xA0;BC.

During this period, Zoroastrianism spread in the Caucasus and Atropatene. <a href="/wiki/Caucasian_Albania" title="Caucasian Albania">Caucasian Albanians</a>, the original inhabitants of northeastern Azerbaijan, ruled that area from around the 4th century BC, and established an independent kingdom that came under the cultural influence of the <a href="/wiki/Armenians" title="Armenians">Armenians</a>.</p><p>In the 4th and 3rd centuries BC, following the overthrow of the Achaemenid Empire, the southwestern part of modern Azerbaijan was part of the Kingdom of Armenia ruled by the <a href="/wiki/Orontid_Dynasty" title="Orontid Dynasty">Orontid Dynasty</a>; between the years 189 BC and 428 AD the western half of modern Azerbaijan, including the exclave of <a href="/wiki/Nakhchivan_Autonomous_Republic" title="Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic">Nakhchivan</a>, were included into the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Armenia_(antiquity)" title="Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)">Kingdom of Greater Armenia</a> ruled by Armenia&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Artaxiad" class="mw-redirect" title="Artaxiad">Artaxiad</a> and <a href="/wiki/Arsacid_dynasty_of_Armenia" title="Arsacid dynasty of Armenia">Arsacid</a> dynasties, the latter itself a branch of the eponymous <a href="/wiki/Parthian_Empire" title="Parthian Empire">Arsacid dynasty of Parthia</a>.</p><p>After the partition of the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Armenia_(antiquity)" title="Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)">Kingdom of Armenia</a> by <a href="/wiki/Persia" class="mw-redirect" title="Persia">Persia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Byzantium" title="Byzantium">Byzantium</a> in 387 AD, the provinces of <a href="/wiki/Artsakh" title="Artsakh">Artsakh</a> and <a href="/wiki/Utik" title="Utik">Utik</a>, which had an ethnically mixed population, passed to <a href="/wiki/Caucasian_Albania" title="Caucasian Albania">Caucasian Albania</a>.</p><p>The Persian <a href="/wiki/Sassanid_Empire" class="mw-redirect" title="Sassanid Empire">Sassanids</a> turned Caucasian Albania into a <a href="/wiki/Vassal_state" title="Vassal state">vassal state</a> in AD 252, while King Urnayr officially adopted Christianity as the state religion in the 4th century. Despite Sassanid rule, Albania remained an entity in the region until the 9th century, while fully subordinate to Sassanid Persia, and retained its monarchy. In the first half of the 7th century AD, the Islamic <a href="/wiki/Umayyad_Caliphate" title="Umayyad Caliphate">Umayyad Caliphate</a> repulsed both the Sassanids and Byzantines from the Caucasus region and turned Caucasian Albania into a vassal state after the Christian resistance, led by King <a href="/wiki/Javanshir" title="Javanshir">Javanshir</a>, was suppressed in 667. Caucasian Albania however, came already under nominal Muslim rule through the <a href="/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_Persia" title="Muslim conquest of Persia">Muslim conquest of Persia</a>, as it made up part of the Sassanid territory upon advent of the Muslim conquest. The power vacuum left by the decline of the <a href="/wiki/Abbasid_Caliphate" title="Abbasid Caliphate">Abbasid Caliphate</a> was filled by numerous local dynasties such as the <a href="/wiki/Sallarid" class="mw-redirect" title="Sallarid">Sallarids</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sajids" class="mw-redirect" title="Sajids">Sajids</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shaddadid" class="mw-redirect" title="Shaddadid">Shaddadids</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rawadid" class="mw-redirect" title="Rawadid">Rawadids</a> and <a href="/wiki/Buyid_dynasty" title="Buyid dynasty">Buyids</a>. At the beginning of the 11th century, the territory was gradually seized by waves of <a href="/wiki/Turkic_peoples" title="Turkic peoples">Turkic</a> <a href="/wiki/Oghuz_Turks" title="Oghuz Turks">Oghuz</a> tribes from Central Asia. The first of these Turkic dynasties established was the <a href="/wiki/Seljuq_Empire" class="mw-redirect" title="Seljuq Empire">Seljuqs</a>, which entered the area now known as Azerbaijan by 1067.</p><p>The pre-Turkic population that lived on the territory of modern Azerbaijani Republic spoke several Indo-European and Caucasian languages, among them &#x2013; <a href="/wiki/Armenian_language" title="Armenian language">Armenian</a> and an <a href="/wiki/Iranian_language" class="mw-redirect" title="Iranian language">Iranian language</a> called the <a href="/wiki/Old_Azari_language" class="mw-redirect" title="Old Azari language">Old Azari language</a>, which was gradually replaced by a <a href="/wiki/Turkic_language" class="mw-redirect" title="Turkic language">Turkic language</a>, the early precursor of the <a href="/wiki/Azerbaijani_language" title="Azerbaijani language">Azerbaijani language</a> of today. To distinguish it from the Turkic Azerbaijani or Azeri language, this Iranian language, is designated as the Azari language (or Old Azari language), because the Turkic language and people are also designated as &quot;Azarbaijani&quot; or &quot;Azari&quot; in the <a href="/wiki/Persian_language" title="Persian language">Persian language</a>. However some linguists have also designated the <a href="/wiki/Tat_language_(Caucasus)" title="Tat language (Caucasus)">Tati dialects</a> of <a href="/wiki/Azerbaijan_(Iran)" title="Azerbaijan (Iran)">Iranian Azerbaijan</a> and the Republic of Azerbaijan, like those spoken by the <a href="/wiki/Tat_people_(Caucasus)" title="Tat people (Caucasus)">Tats</a>, as a remnant of Azari. Locally, the possessions of the subsequent <a href="/wiki/Great_Seljuq_Empire" class="mw-redirect" title="Great Seljuq Empire">Seljuq Empire</a> were ruled by <a href="/wiki/Eldiguzids" title="Eldiguzids">Atabegs</a>, who were technically vassals of the Seljuq sultans, being sometimes <i>de facto</i> rulers themselves. Under the <a href="/wiki/Seljuq_dynasty" title="Seljuq dynasty">Seljuq Turks</a>, local poets such as <a href="/wiki/Nizami_Ganjavi" title="Nizami Ganjavi">Nizami Ganjavi</a> and <a href="/wiki/Khaqani" title="Khaqani">Khagani Shirvani</a> gave rise to a blossoming of <a href="/wiki/Persian_literature" title="Persian literature">Persian literature</a> on the territory of present-day Azerbaijan. The next ruling state of the <a href="/wiki/Jalayirids" class="mw-redirect" title="Jalayirids">Jalayirids</a> was short-lived and fell under the conquests of <a href="/wiki/Timur" title="Timur">Timur</a>.</p><p>The local dynasty of the <a href="/wiki/Shirvanshah" title="Shirvanshah">Shirvanshahs</a> became a <a href="/wiki/Vassal" title="Vassal">vassal</a> state of <a href="/wiki/Timurid_dynasty" title="Timurid dynasty">Timur&apos;s Empire</a>, and assisted him in his war with the ruler of the <a href="/wiki/Golden_Horde" title="Golden Horde">Golden Horde</a> <a href="/wiki/Tokhtamysh" title="Tokhtamysh">Tokhtamysh</a>. Following Timur&apos;s death, two independent and rival states emerged: <a href="/wiki/Kara_Koyunlu" title="Kara Koyunlu">Kara Koyunlu</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ak_Koyunlu" class="mw-redirect" title="Ak Koyunlu">Ak Koyunlu</a>. The Shirvanshahs returned, maintaining a high degree of autonomy as local rulers and vassals from 861 until 1539. During their conquest and persecution by the Iranian <a href="/wiki/Safavid_dynasty" title="Safavid dynasty">Safavids</a> in 1501, the last dynasty imposed <a href="/wiki/Shia_Islam" title="Shia Islam">Shia Islam</a> upon the formerly <a href="/wiki/Sunni" class="mw-redirect" title="Sunni">Sunni</a> population, as it did over its territories in modern-day Iran, as it was battling against the Sunni <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. This, in combination with another <a href="/wiki/Safavid_conversion_of_Iran_to_Shia_Islam" title="Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam">series of events</a>, the Safavids laid the foundation for the fact that both the contemporary Republic of Azerbaijan and Iran are the only Shia majority countries ever since. Despite efforts of the Safavids, the Ottomans briefly managed to occupy swaths of present-day Azerbaijan twice over the centuries. Also, Baku and its environs were briefly managed by the Russians in the early 18th century through the consequences of the <a href="/wiki/Russo-Persian_War_(1722-1723)" class="mw-redirect" title="Russo-Persian War (1722-1723)">Russo-Persian War</a>.

However <i>de facto</i> self-ruling <a href="/wiki/Khanates_of_the_Caucasus" title="Khanates of the Caucasus">khanates</a> emerged in the area, especially following the collapse of the Zand dynasty and in the early Qajar era. These khanates, though often self-ruling, were <a href="/wiki/Vassals" class="mw-redirect" title="Vassals">vassals</a> and <a href="/wiki/Commoners" class="mw-redirect" title="Commoners">subjects</a> of the Iranian shah (King). The khanates exercised control over their affairs via international trade routes between Central Asia and the West. From the late 18th century and on, Imperial Russia changed to a more aggressive geo-political stance towards its two neighbors (and rivals) to the south, namely Iran and Turkey. Following a chain of events that started with the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Krtsanisi" title="Battle of Krtsanisi">re-subjugation of Georgia into Iran in 1795</a>, Russia would now actively contest and battle with the latter over possession of the Caucasus region which was, for most of its part, in the hands of Iran. The successful Russian campaigns in the later stages of the <a href="/wiki/Russo-Persian_War_(1804%E2%80%9313)" title="Russo-Persian War (1804&#x2013;13)">Russo-Persian War (1804&#x2013;13)</a> were concluded with the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Gulistan" title="Treaty of Gulistan">Treaty of Gulistan</a>, in which the shah&apos;s claims to some of the Khanates of the Caucasus were dismissed by Russia on the ground that they had been <i>de facto</i> independent long before their Russian occupation.</p><p>Following Qajar Iran&apos;s loss in the 1804&#x2013;1813 war, it was forced to concede suzerainty over most of the khanates (alongside Georgia and Dagestan) to the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Empire" title="Russian Empire">Russian Empire</a> per the Gulistan treaty. The area to the north of the river <a href="/wiki/Aras_River" class="mw-redirect" title="Aras River">Aras</a>, amongst which the territory of the contemporary Republic of Azerbaijan, was Iranian territory until it was occupied by Russia in the course of the 19th century.

Although the bulk of the newly formed Azerbaijani army was engaged in putting down an Armenian revolt that had just broken out in <a href="/wiki/Karabakh" title="Karabakh">Karabakh</a>, Azerbaijanis did not surrender their brief independence of 1918&#x2013;20 quickly or easily. As many as 20,000 Azerbaijani soldiers died resisting what was effectively a Russian reconquest.</p><p>On 13 October 1921, the Soviet republics of Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia signed an agreement with Turkey known as the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Kars" title="Treaty of Kars">Treaty of Kars</a>. The previously independent Naxicivan SSR would also become an autonomous ASSR within the Azerbaijan SSR by the treaty of Kars. On the other hand, Armenia was awarded the region of <a href="/wiki/Syunik_Province" title="Syunik Province">Zangezur</a> and Turkey agreed to return <a href="/wiki/Gyumri" title="Gyumri">Gyumri</a> (then known as Alexandropol).</p><p>During <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Azerbaijan played a crucial role in the strategic energy policy of Soviet Union, with most of the Soviet Union&apos;s oil on the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)" title="Eastern Front (World War II)">Eastern Front</a> being supplied by Baku. By the Decree of the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Soviet_of_the_USSR" class="mw-redirect" title="Supreme Soviet of the USSR">Supreme Soviet of the USSR</a> in February 1942, the commitment of more than 500 workers and employees of the <a href="/wiki/Petroleum_industry" title="Petroleum industry">oil industry</a> of Azerbaijan was awarded orders and medals. <a href="/wiki/Operation_Edelweiss" class="mw-redirect" title="Operation Edelweiss">Operation Edelweiss</a> carried out by the German <a href="/wiki/Wehrmacht" title="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> targeted Baku because of its importance as the energy (petroleum) dynamo of the USSR. A fifth of all Azerbaijanis fought in the Second World War from 1941 to 1945. Approximately 681,000 people with over 100,000 of them women went to the front, while the total population of Azerbaijan was 3.4&#xA0;million at the time. Some 250,000 people from Azerbaijan were killed on the front. More than 130 Azerbaijanis were named <a href="/wiki/Hero_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="Hero of the Soviet Union">Heroes of the Soviet Union</a>. Azerbaijani Major-General <a href="/wiki/Azi_Aslanov" class="mw-redirect" title="Azi Aslanov">Azi Aslanov</a> was twice awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union.</p><p>Following the politics of <i><a href="/wiki/Glasnost" title="Glasnost">glasnost</a></i>, initiated by <a href="/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev" title="Mikhail Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>, civil unrest and ethnic strife grew in various regions of the Soviet Union, including <a href="/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_Autonomous_Oblast" title="Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast">Nagorno-Karabakh</a>, an autonomous region of the Azerbaijan SSR. The disturbances in Azerbaijan, in response to Moscow&apos;s indifference to already heated conflict, resulted in calls for independence and secession, which culminated in <a href="/wiki/Black_January" title="Black January">Black January</a> in Baku. Later in 1990, the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Soviet_of_Azerbaijan_SSR" class="mw-redirect" title="Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan SSR">Supreme Council of the Azerbaijan SSR</a> dropped the words &quot;Soviet Socialist&quot; from the title, adopted the Declaration of Sovereignty of the Azerbaijan Republic and restored flag of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic as the state flag. On 18 October 1991, the Supreme Council of Azerbaijan adopted a Declaration of Independence which was affirmed by a nationwide referendum in December 1991, when the Soviet Union officially ceased to exist on 26 December 1991.</p><p>The early years of independence were overshadowed by the <a href="/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_war" class="mw-redirect" title="Nagorno-Karabakh war">Nagorno-Karabakh war</a> with the ethnic Armenian majority of Nagorno-Karabakh backed by Armenia. By the end of hostilities in 1994, Armenians controlled up to 14&#x2013;16 percent of Azerbaijani territory, including Nagorno-Karabakh itself.

According to the 1970 census, there were 510,000 ethnic <a href="/wiki/Russian_diaspora" title="Russian diaspora">Russians</a> and 484,000 Armenians in Azerbaijan.</p><p>In 1993, democratically elected president <a href="/wiki/Abulfaz_Elchibey" title="Abulfaz Elchibey">Abulfaz Elchibey</a> was overthrown by a military insurrection led by Colonel <a href="/wiki/Surat_Huseynov" title="Surat Huseynov">Surat Huseynov</a>, which resulted in the rise to power of the former leader of <a href="/wiki/Azerbaijan_Soviet_Socialist_Republic" title="Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic">Soviet Azerbaijan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Heydar_Aliyev" title="Heydar Aliyev">Heydar Aliyev</a>. In 1994, Surat Huseynov, by that time a prime minister, attempted another military coup against Heydar Aliyev, but Huseynov was arrested and charged with treason.

The coup was averted, resulting in the killing of the latter and disbanding of Azerbaijan&apos;s OMON units. At the same time, the country was tainted by rampant corruption in the governing bureaucracy. In October 1998, Aliyev was reelected for a second term. Despite the much improved economy, particularly with the exploitations of <a href="/wiki/Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli" class="mw-redirect" title="Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli">Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli oil field</a> and <a href="/wiki/Shah_Deniz_gas_field" title="Shah Deniz gas field">Shah Deniz gas field</a>, Aliyev&apos;s presidency was criticized due to suspected vote fraud and corruption.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Ilham_Aliyev" title="Ilham Aliyev">Ilham Aliyev</a>, the son of Heydar Aliyev, assumed as the chairmen of the <a href="/wiki/New_Azerbaijan_Party" title="New Azerbaijan Party">New Azerbaijan Party</a> as well as the office of presidency when his father died in 2003. He was <a href="/wiki/Azerbaijani_presidential_election,_2013" title="Azerbaijani presidential election, 2013">reelected to a third term</a> as president in October 2013. He then launched a crackdown on opposition elements. In November, he put two prominent opponents on trial for inciting riots ten months earlier: Ilgar Mammadov, the chairman of the opposition Republican Alternative (REAL); and Ilgar Mammadov, the deputy chairman of the New Equality Party (Musavat). In addition the dissident Islamic theologian Taleh Bagirzada was sentenced to two years&#x2019; imprisonment. The opposition newspaper <i>Azadiq</i> was closed down.

Within four years protected areas doubled and now make up eight percent of the country&apos;s territory. Since 2001 the government has set up seven large reserves and almost doubled the sector of the budget earmarked for environmental protection.</p><p>Azerbaijan is home to a vast variety of landscapes. Over half of Azerbaijan&apos;s land mass consists of mountain ridges, crests, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Yaila&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Yaila (page does not exist)">yailas</a>, and plateaus which rise up to hypsometric levels of 400&#x2013;1000&#xA0;meters (including the Middle and Lower lowlands), in some places (Talis, Jeyranchol-Ajinohur and Langabiz-Alat foreranges) up to 100&#x2013;120&#xA0;meters, and others from 0&#x2013;50&#xA0;meters and up (<a href="/wiki/Qobustan,_Absheron" title="Qobustan, Absheron">Qobustan, Absheron</a>). The rest of Azerbaijan&apos;s terrain consist of plains and lowlands.

Azerbaijan&apos;s diverse landscape affects the ways air masses enter the country. The Greater Caucasus protects the country from direct influences of cold air masses coming from the north. That leads to the formation of <a href="/wiki/Subtropics" title="Subtropics">subtropical climate</a> on most foothills and plains of the country.

This is particularly evidenced by remnants of ancient rivers found throughout the country. The country&apos;s water systems are continually changing under the influence of natural forces and human introduced industrial activities. Artificial rivers (canals) and ponds are a part of Azerbaijan&apos;s water systems. In terms of water supply, Azerbaijan is below the average in the world with approximately 100,000 cubic metres (3,531,467 cubic feet) per year of water per square kilometer. All big <a href="/wiki/Reservoir" title="Reservoir">water reservoirs</a> are built on Kur.

Animal carvings on architectural monuments, ancient rocks and stones survived up to the present times. The first information on the animal kingdom of Azerbaijan was collected during the visits of naturalists to Azerbaijan in the 17th century. Unlike fauna, the concept of animal kingdom covers not only the types of animals, but also the number of individual species.</p><p>There are 106 species of mammals, 97 species of fish, 363 species of birds, 10 species of amphibians and 52 species of reptiles which have been recorded and classified in Azerbaijan. The national animal of Azerbaijan is the <a href="/wiki/Karabakh_horse" title="Karabakh horse">Karabakh horse</a>, a mountain-steppe racing and riding horse endemic to Azerbaijan.

In recent years, large numbers of Azerbaijani journalists, bloggers, lawyers, human rights activists have been rounded up and jailed for their criticism of President Aliyev and government authorities. A resolution adopted by the European Parliament in September 2015 described Azerbaijan as &quot;having suffered the greatest decline in democratic governance in all of Eurasia over the past ten years,&quot; noting as well that its dialogue with the country on human rights has &quot;not made any substantial progress.&quot;</p><p>Azerbaijan has been harshly criticized for bribing foreign officials and diplomats for promoting its causes abroad and legitimizing its elections at home, a practice which has been termed as &apos;caviar diplomacy&apos;.</p><p>The short-lived Azerbaijan Democratic Republic succeeded in establishing diplomatic relations with six countries, sending diplomatic representatives to Germany and Finland. The process of international recognition of Azerbaijan&apos;s independence from the collapsing Soviet Union lasted roughly one year. The most recent country to recognize Azerbaijan was Bahrain, on 6 November 1996. Full diplomatic relations, including mutual exchanges of missions, were first established with Turkey, Pakistan, the United States, Iran and Israel.

The Government is in the process of increasing its military budget. Furthermore, economic sanctions by Turkey to the west and by Azerbaijan itself to the east have combined to greatly erode Armenia&apos;s economy, leading to steep increases in prices for basic commodities and a great decline in the Armenian state revenues. A recent attack by the Azerbaijani military on Armenian villages in Nagorno-Karabakh has caused physical damage and raised controversy over the future of peaceful relations between Azerbaijan and its neighbor, Armenia.</p><p>Azerbaijan is an active member of international coalitions fighting international terrorism.
