In the United States, it was released on <a href="/wiki/Film_stock" title="Film stock">film stock</a>, expanding to venues using digital projectors. The film was successful at the box office with a worldwide gross of over $675 million, and received positive reviews from critics, who gave particular praise to the film&apos;s science fiction themes, Hans Zimmer&apos;s musical score, visual effects, and the performances of McConaughey, Hathaway, Chastain, and <a href="/wiki/Mackenzie_Foy" title="Mackenzie Foy">Mackenzie Foy</a>.

Joseph Cooper, a widowed former <a href="/wiki/NASA" title="NASA">NASA</a> pilot, runs a farm with his father-in-law, son, and daughter Murphy, who believes her bedroom is haunted by a <a href="/wiki/Poltergeist" title="Poltergeist">poltergeist</a>. When a pattern is created out of dust on the floor, Cooper realizes that <a href="/wiki/Gravity" title="Gravity">gravity</a> is behind its formation, not a &quot;ghost&quot;. He interprets the pattern as a set of <a href="/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system" title="Geographic coordinate system">geographic coordinates</a> formed into <a href="/wiki/Binary_code" title="Binary code">binary code</a>. Cooper and Murphy follow them to a secret NASA facility, where they are met by Cooper&apos;s former professor Dr. Brand.</p><p>Brand reveals that a <a href="/wiki/Wormhole" title="Wormhole">wormhole</a> mysteriously appeared near <a href="/wiki/Saturn" title="Saturn">Saturn</a> 48 years earlier, opening a pathway to a distant <a href="/wiki/Galaxy" title="Galaxy">galaxy</a> with potentially-habitable planets. Twelve volunteers traveled through it to assess each planet&apos;s suitability as humanity&apos;s new home, led by Dr. Mann. Volunteers Miller, Edmunds and Mann have sent back encouraging data from planets near a <a href="/wiki/Black_hole" title="Black hole">black hole</a> called Gargantua. Brand recruits Cooper to pilot the spaceship <i>Endurance</i> to investigate further, while he works on &quot;Plan A&quot; &#x2013; a gravitational theory for propulsion that would allow a mass exodus from Earth. The <i>Endurance</i> also carries 5,000 frozen <a href="/wiki/Embryo" title="Embryo">embryos</a> for the &quot;Plan B&quot; backup plan, which is to colonize a habitable planet to ensure humanity&apos;s survival. Cooper agrees to go, upsetting Murphy.</p><p>Cooper&apos;s crew consists of scientists Romilly, Doyle, Brand&apos;s daughter Amelia, and robots TARS and CASE. Traversing the wormhole, they head to Miller&apos;s planet, an ocean world where time is <a href="/wiki/Gravitational_time_dilation" title="Gravitational time dilation">severely dilated</a> because of its proximity to Gargantua; for each hour there, seven years pass on Earth. They find only the wreckage from Miller&apos;s expedition. Doyle and Amelia go to get Miller&apos;s data just as a gigantic tidal wave hits. CASE rescues Amelia but Doyle is too slow; the tidal wave kills him and floods the engines, preventing a timely departure. When they managed to return to <i>Endurance</i>, 23 years have elapsed on Earth.</p><p>Murphy, now an adult, has been assisting Dr. Brand with his research. On his deathbed, he admits to her that Plan A was not possible &#x2013; he has known since <i>Endurance</i> departed. He reveals that Plan B was the only plan all along. In a recorded video session Murphy notifies Amelia of her father&apos;s death, accusing her and Cooper of abandoning Earth. Murphy continues working on a solution to Plan A, believing the equations can be solved if she can somehow get more data on <a href="/wiki/Gravitational_singularity" title="Gravitational singularity">gravitational singularities</a>.</p><p>With limited fuel, the crew choose Mann&apos;s planet over Edmunds&apos; as the next stop, since Mann is still transmitting. Once there, Mann assures the crew that the frozen planet is habitable despite its <a href="/wiki/Ammonia" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a>-laden atmosphere. Then, while out together surveying the planet, Mann attempts to kill Cooper, revealing that he falsified the data in hopes of being rescued. After damaging Cooper&apos;s helmet, he leaves him to die; stealing Cooper&apos;s ranger and heading for <i>Endurance</i>. Meanwhile, Romilly is killed when he attempts to access the false data in Mann&apos;s robot, which he had programmed to explode. Amelia rescues Cooper and they race to <i>Endurance</i> in a second lander, where Mann is attempting a dangerous manual docking operation. Mann ignores Cooper and Amelia&apos;s warnings not to open the airlock and is killed in the attempt, causing the <i>Endurance</i> to spin out of control in the process. Cooper uses the lander to stabilize the ship.</p><p>CASE warns Cooper that <i>Endurance</i> is slipping toward Gargantua&apos;s pull. Cooper makes a quick decision to use Gargantua as a <a href="/wiki/Gravity_assist" title="Gravity assist">gravitational slingshot</a> to propel the ship toward Edmunds&apos; planet, but their proximity to Gargantua means that another 51 years will elapse on Earth. To shed weight, Cooper jettisons first TARS and then himself toward the black hole, so that Amelia and CASE can complete the journey. Slipping past the <a href="/wiki/Event_horizon" title="Event horizon">event horizon</a>, Cooper and TARS find themselves inside a <a href="/wiki/Tesseract" title="Tesseract">tesseract</a>, which resembles a stream of bookshelves capable of peering into Murphy&apos;s bedroom at different periods in her life. Cooper surmises that the tesseract and wormhole were created by <a href="/wiki/Five-dimensional_space" title="Five-dimensional space">five-dimensional</a> <a href="/wiki/Human" title="Human">beings</a> to enable communication with Murphy, and that he was her &quot;ghost&quot; all along. Using the second-hand on the watch he gave her before he left, Cooper relays the quantum data to Murphy, enabling her to solve the gravitational equation.</p><p>Following a turbulent ejection, Cooper awakens in a <a href="/wiki/Space_habitat" title="Space habitat">space habitat</a> orbiting Saturn. He reunites with an aged Murphy nearing death. At Murphy&apos;s request, Cooper and TARS leave to rejoin Amelia on Edmunds&apos; habitable planet, where she is preparing a new human colony using Plan B.</p><p>The premise for <i>Interstellar</i> was conceived by film producer <a href="/wiki/Lynda_Obst" title="Lynda Obst">Lynda Obst</a> and <a href="/wiki/Theoretical_physicist" class="mw-redirect" title="Theoretical physicist">theoretical physicist</a> <a href="/wiki/Kip_Thorne" title="Kip Thorne">Kip Thorne</a>, who collaborated on the film <i><a href="/wiki/Contact_(1997_American_film)" title="Contact (1997 American film)">Contact</a></i> (1997) and had known each other since <a href="/wiki/Carl_Sagan" title="Carl Sagan">Carl Sagan</a> set them up on a blind date. The two conceived a scenario, based on Thorne&apos;s work, about &quot;the most exotic events in the universe suddenly becoming accessible to humans&quot;, and attracted filmmaker <a href="/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>&apos;s interest in directing. The film began development in June 2006, when Spielberg and <a href="/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> announced plans for a science fiction film based on an eight-page treatment written by Obst and Thorne. Obst was attached to produce the film, which <i><a href="/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i> said would &quot;take several years to come together&quot; before Spielberg directed it. By March 2007, Jonathan Nolan was hired to write a screenplay for the film, titled <i>Interstellar</i>.</p><p>Spielberg moved his production studio <a href="/wiki/DreamWorks" title="DreamWorks">DreamWorks</a> in 2009 from Paramount to <a href="/wiki/Walt_Disney_Studios_(division)" title="Walt Disney Studios (division)">Walt Disney Studios</a>, and Paramount needed a new director for <i>Interstellar</i>. Jonathan Nolan recommended his brother Christopher, who joined the project in 2012. Christopher Nolan met with Kip Thorne, then attached as executive producer, to discuss the use of <a href="/wiki/Spacetime" title="Spacetime">spacetime</a> in the story. In January 2013, Paramount and Warner Bros. announced that Christopher Nolan was in negotiations to direct <i>Interstellar</i>. Nolan said he wanted to encourage the goal of <a href="/wiki/Human_spaceflight" title="Human spaceflight">human spaceflight</a>. He intended to write a screenplay based on his own idea that he would merge with his brother&apos;s screenplay. By the following March, Nolan was confirmed to direct <i>Interstellar</i>, which would be produced under his label <a href="/wiki/Syncopy_Inc." title="Syncopy Inc.">Syncopy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lynda_Obst_Productions" title="Lynda Obst Productions">Lynda Obst Productions</a>. <i><a href="/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter" title="The Hollywood Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a></i> said Nolan will earn a salary of <span class="nowrap">$20 million</span> against 20% of what <i>Interstellar</i> grosses; a final total of approximately $121 million. To research for the film, Nolan visited NASA as well as the private space program <a href="/wiki/SpaceX" title="SpaceX">SpaceX</a>.</p><p>Though Paramount and Warner Bros. are traditionally rival studios, Warner Bros., who released Nolan&apos;s <a href="/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_Trilogy" title="The Dark Knight Trilogy">Batman films</a> and works with Nolan&apos;s Syncopy, sought a stake in Nolan&apos;s production of <i>Interstellar</i> for Paramount. Warner Bros. agreed to give Paramount its rights to co-finance the next film in the <i><a href="/wiki/Friday_the_13th_(franchise)" title="Friday the 13th (franchise)">Friday the 13th</a></i> horror franchise and to have a stake in a future film based on the TV series <i><a href="/wiki/South_Park" title="South Park">South Park</a></i>. Warner Bros. also agreed to let Paramount co-finance &quot;a to-be-determined A-list Warners property&quot;. In August 2013, <a href="/wiki/Legendary_Pictures" class="mw-redirect" title="Legendary Pictures">Legendary Pictures</a> finalized an agreement with Warner Bros. to finance approximately 25 percent of the film&apos;s production. Although it failed to renew its eight-year production partnership with Warner Bros., Legendary reportedly agreed to forego financing for <i><a href="/wiki/Batman_v_Superman:_Dawn_of_Justice" title="Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a></i> in exchange for the stake in <i>Interstellar</i>.</p><p>Screenwriter Jonathan Nolan was hired by Spielberg to write a script for <i>Interstellar</i>, and he worked on it for four years. To learn the science, he studied <a href="/wiki/Theory_of_relativity" title="Theory of relativity">relativity</a> at the <a href="/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology" title="California Institute of Technology">California Institute of Technology</a> while writing the script. Jonathan said he was pessimistic about the <a href="/wiki/Space_Shuttle_program" title="Space Shuttle program">Space Shuttle program</a> ending and how NASA lacked financing for a <a href="/wiki/Manned_mission_to_Mars" class="mw-redirect" title="Manned mission to Mars">manned mission to Mars</a>. The screenwriter found inspiration in science fiction films with apocalyptic themes, such as <i><a href="/wiki/WALL-E" title="WALL-E">WALL-E</a></i> (2008) and <i><a href="/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film)" title="Avatar (2009 film)">Avatar</a></i> (2009). <i><a href="/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" title="Entertainment Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a></i> has commented: &quot;He set the story in a dystopian future ravaged by blight but populated with hardy folk who refuse to bow to despair.&quot; Jonathan&apos;s brother, director Christopher Nolan, had worked on other science fiction scripts but decided to take the <i>Interstellar</i> script and choose amongst the vast array of ideas presented by Jonathan and Kip Thorne, picking what he felt he as a director could get &quot;across to the audience and hopefully not lose them&quot;, before he merged it with a script he had been working on for years on his own. Christopher kept in place Jonathan&apos;s conception of the first hour, which is set on a <a href="/wiki/Resource_depletion" title="Resource depletion">resource-depleted</a> Earth in the near future. The setting was inspired by the <a href="/wiki/Dust_Bowl" title="Dust Bowl">Dust Bowl</a> that took place in the United States during the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> in the 1930s. Christopher instead revised the rest of the script, in which a team travels into space. After watching the 2012 documentary <i><a href="/wiki/The_Dust_Bowl_(film)" title="The Dust Bowl (film)">The Dust Bowl</a></i> for inspiration, Christopher contacted director <a href="/wiki/Ken_Burns" title="Ken Burns">Ken Burns</a> and producer Dayton Duncan, requesting permission to use some of their featured interviews in <i>Interstellar</i>.</p><p>Christopher Nolan wanted an actor who could bring to life the vision of Cooper being an <a href="/wiki/Everyman" title="Everyman">everyman</a> character with whom &quot;the audience could experience the story&quot;. Nolan said he became interested in casting Matthew McConaughey after seeing him in an early cut of the 2012 film <i><a href="/wiki/Mud_(2012_film)" title="Mud (2012 film)">Mud</a></i>, which he had an opportunity to see since he was friends with one of its producers, Aaron Ryder. Nolan went to visit McConaughey while he was filming for the TV series <i><a href="/wiki/True_Detective_(TV_series)" class="mw-redirect" title="True Detective (TV series)">True Detective</a></i>.</p><p>Anne Hathaway was invited to Nolan&apos;s home, where she read the script for <i>Interstellar</i>. Paramount announced in April 2013 that both actors were cast in the film&apos;s starring roles. Jessica Chastain was contacted while she was filming <i><a href="/wiki/Miss_Julie_(2014_film)" title="Miss Julie (2014 film)">Miss Julie</a></i> in Northern Ireland, and a script was delivered to her. Matt Damon was cast in late August 2013 in a supporting role and filmed his scenes in Iceland.</p><p>Nolan filmed <i>Interstellar</i> with <a href="/wiki/Anamorphic_format" title="Anamorphic format">anamorphic</a> <a href="/wiki/35_mm" class="mw-redirect" title="35 mm">35 mm</a> and <a href="/wiki/IMAX" title="IMAX">IMAX 70 mm</a> photography. Cinematographer <a href="/wiki/Hoyte_van_Hoytema" title="Hoyte van Hoytema">Hoyte van Hoytema</a> was hired for <i>Interstellar</i>, as <a href="/wiki/Wally_Pfister" title="Wally Pfister">Wally Pfister</a>, Nolan&apos;s cinematographer on all of his past films, was working on his directorial debut, <i><a href="/wiki/Transcendence_(2014_film)" title="Transcendence (2014 film)">Transcendence</a></i>. IMAX cameras were used for <i>Interstellar</i> more than for any of Nolan&apos;s previous films. To minimize the use of computer-generated imagery, the director had practical locations built, such as the interior of a space shuttle. Van Hoytema retooled an IMAX camera to be handheld for shooting interior scenes. Some of the film&apos;s sequences were shot with an IMAX camera installed in the nosecone of a <a href="/wiki/Learjet" title="Learjet">Learjet</a>.</p><p>Nolan, who is known to keep details of his productions secret, strove to ensure secrecy for <i>Interstellar</i>. <i><a href="/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal" title="The Wall Street Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a></i> reported, &quot;The famously secretive filmmaker has gone to extreme lengths to guard the script to ... <i>Interstellar</i>, just as he did with the blockbuster <i>Dark Knight</i> trilogy.&quot; As one security measure, <i>Interstellar</i> was filmed under the name <i>Flora&apos;s Letter</i>, Flora being one of Nolan&apos;s four children with producer Emma Thomas.</p><p>The film&apos;s principal photography was scheduled to last for four months. It began on <span class="nowrap">August 6</span>, 2013, in the province of <a href="/wiki/Alberta" title="Alberta">Alberta</a>. Towns in Alberta where filming took place included <a href="/wiki/Nanton,_Alberta" title="Nanton, Alberta">Nanton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Longview,_Alberta" title="Longview, Alberta">Longview</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lethbridge" title="Lethbridge">Lethbridge</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fort_Macleod" title="Fort Macleod">Fort Macleod</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Okotoks" title="Okotoks">Okotoks</a>. In Okotoks, filming took place at the <a href="/wiki/Seaman_Stadium" title="Seaman Stadium">Seaman Stadium</a> and the Olde Town Plaza. For a cornfield scene, production designer <a href="/wiki/Nathan_Crowley" title="Nathan Crowley">Nathan Crowley</a> planted <span class="nowrap">500 acres</span> of corn that would be destroyed in an apocalyptic <a href="/wiki/Dust_storm" title="Dust storm">dust storm</a> scene, intended to be similar to storms experienced during the <a href="/wiki/Dust_Bowl" title="Dust Bowl">Dust Bowl</a> in 1930s United States. Additional scenes involving the dust storm and McConaughey&apos;s character were also filmed in <a href="/wiki/Fort_Macleod" title="Fort Macleod">Fort Macleod</a>, where the giant dust clouds were created on location using large fans to blow <a href="/wiki/Cellulose_fiber" title="Cellulose fiber">cellulose-based</a> synthetic dust through the air. Filming in the province lasted till <span class="nowrap">September 9</span>, 2013, and involved hundreds of extras as well as approximately <span class="nowrap">130 crew</span> members, most of them local.</p><p>Filming also took place in <a href="/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a>, where Nolan had previously filmed scenes for his 2005 film <i><a href="/wiki/Batman_Begins" title="Batman Begins">Batman Begins</a></i>. The crew transported mock spaceships weighing approximately 10,000 pounds (4,500&#xA0;kg) to the country, which was chosen to represent two extraterrestrial planets: one covered in ice, and the other covered in water. A two-week Iceland shoot was scheduled, and a crew of approximately <span class="nowrap">350 people</span>, including <span class="nowrap">130 locals</span>, worked on it. Locations included the Sv&#xED;nafellsj&#xF6;kull glacier and the town of <a href="/wiki/Kirkjub%C3%A6jarklaustur" title="Kirkjub&#xE6;jarklaustur">Klaustur</a>. While filming a water scene in Iceland, actress Anne Hathaway almost suffered <a href="/wiki/Hypothermia" title="Hypothermia">hypothermia</a> because the <a href="/wiki/Dry_suit" title="Dry suit">dry suit</a> she was wearing had not been properly secured.</p><p>After the Iceland shoot, the crew moved to Los Angeles to film for <span class="nowrap">54 days</span>. Filming locations included the <a href="/wiki/Westin_Bonaventure_Hotel" title="Westin Bonaventure Hotel">Westin Bonaventure Hotel and Suites</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Convention_Center" title="Los Angeles Convention Center">Los Angeles Convention Center</a>, a Sony Pictures <a href="/wiki/Soundstage" class="mw-redirect" title="Soundstage">soundstage</a> in <a href="/wiki/Culver_City,_California" title="Culver City, California">Culver City</a>, and a private residence in <a href="/wiki/Altadena,_California" title="Altadena, California">Altadena</a>. Filming concluded in December 2013, and Nolan started editing the film for its release in 2014. Production completed with a budget of <span class="nowrap">$165 million</span>, <span class="nowrap">$10 million</span> less than what was allotted by Paramount, Warner Bros., and Legendary Pictures.</p><p><i>Interstellar</i> features three spacecraft: the Ranger, the <i>Endurance</i>, and the Lander. The Ranger&apos;s function is similar to the <a href="/wiki/Space_Shuttle" title="Space Shuttle">Space Shuttle</a>&apos;s, being able to enter and exit planetary atmospheres. The <i>Endurance</i>, the crew&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Mother_ship" title="Mother ship">mother ship</a>, has a circular structure formed by 12 capsules: four with planetary colonization equipment, four with engines, and four with the permanent functions of cockpit, medical labs and habitation. Production designer Nathan Crowley said the <i>Endurance</i> was based on the <a href="/wiki/International_Space_Station" title="International Space Station">International Space Station</a>: &quot;It&apos;s a real mish-mash of different kinds of technology. You need analogue stuff as well as digital stuff, you need back-up systems and tangible switches. It&apos;s really like a submarine in space. Every inch of space is used, everything has a purpose.&quot; Lastly, the Lander transports the capsules with colonization equipment to planetary surfaces. Crowley compared it to &quot;a heavy Russian helicopter&quot;.</p><p>The film also features two robots, CASE and TARS, and a dismantled third robot, KIPP. Nolan wanted to avoid making the robots <a href="/wiki/Anthropomorphism" title="Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic</a> and chose a five-foot <a href="/wiki/Quadrilateral" title="Quadrilateral">quadrilateral</a> design. The director said: &quot;It has a very complicated design philosophy. It&apos;s based on mathematics. You&apos;ve got four main blocks and they can be joined in three ways. So you have three combinations you follow. But then within that, it subdivides into a further three joints. And all the places we see lines&#x2014;those can subdivide further. So you can unfold a finger, essentially, but it&apos;s all proportional.&quot; Actor <a href="/wiki/Bill_Irwin" title="Bill Irwin">Bill Irwin</a> voiced and physically controlled both robots, but his image was digitally removed from the film and his voicing for CASE was replaced with actor <a href="/wiki/Josh_Stewart" title="Josh Stewart">Josh Stewart</a>&apos;s voice.</p><p>The human space habitats resemble <a href="/wiki/O%27Neill_cylinder" title="O&apos;Neill cylinder">O&apos;Neill cylinders</a>, a theoretical space colony model proposed by physicist <a href="/wiki/Gerard_K._O%27Neill" title="Gerard K. O&apos;Neill">Gerard K. O&apos;Neill</a> in 1976.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Gregg_Landaker" title="Gregg Landaker">Gregg Landaker</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gary_Rizzo" title="Gary Rizzo">Gary Rizzo</a> were <a href="/wiki/Sound_engineer" class="mw-redirect" title="Sound engineer">sound engineers</a> for the film, tasked with <a href="/wiki/Sound_mixing" class="mw-redirect" title="Sound mixing">sound mixing</a>, while sound editor <a href="/wiki/Richard_King_(sound_designer)" title="Richard King (sound designer)">Richard King</a> supervised the process. Christopher Nolan said he sought to mix the film&apos;s sound to take maximum advantage of current sound equipment in theaters. Nolan paid close attention to designing the sound mix, for instance focusing on what buttons being pressed with astronaut-suit gloves would sound like. The studio&apos;s website said that &quot;The sound on <i>Interstellar</i> has been specially mixed to maximize the power of the low end frequencies in the main channels as well as in the subwoofer channel.&quot; Nolan deliberately intended some dialogue to seem drowned out by ambient noise or music, causing some theaters to post notices emphasising that this effect was intentional and not a fault in their equipment.</p><p>Composer <a href="/wiki/Hans_Zimmer" title="Hans Zimmer">Hans Zimmer</a>, who scored Nolan&apos;s Batman film trilogy and <i><a href="/wiki/Inception_(film)" class="mw-redirect" title="Inception (film)">Inception</a></i>, also scored <i>Interstellar</i>. Zimmer and Nolan strived to develop a unique sound for <i>Interstellar</i>. Zimmer said: &quot;The textures, the music, and the sounds, and the thing we sort of created has sort of seeped into other people&apos;s movies a bit, so it&apos;s time to reinvent. The endless string (<a href="/wiki/Ostinato" title="Ostinato">ostinatos</a>) need to go by the wayside, the big drums are probably in the bin.&quot; Zimmer also said that Nolan did not provide him a script or any plot details for writing music for the film and instead gave the composer &quot;one page of text&quot; that &quot;had more to do with [Zimmer&apos;s] story than the plot of the movie&quot;. Nolan has stated that he said to Zimmer: &quot;I am going to give you an envelope with a letter in it. One page. It&apos;s going to tell you the fable at the center of the story. You work for one day, then play me what you have written&quot;, and that he embraced what Zimmer composed. Zimmer conducted <span class="nowrap">45 scoring</span> sessions for <i>Interstellar</i>, which was three times more than for <i>Inception</i>. The soundtrack was released on November 18, 2014.</p><p>The visual effects company <a href="/wiki/Double_Negative_(VFX)" title="Double Negative (VFX)">Double Negative</a>, which developed effects for Nolan&apos;s 2010 film <i><a href="/wiki/Inception" title="Inception">Inception</a></i>, worked on <i>Interstellar</i>. Visual effects supervisor <a href="/wiki/Paul_Franklin_(visual_effects_supervisor)" title="Paul Franklin (visual effects supervisor)">Paul Franklin</a> said the number of effects in the film was not much greater than in Nolan&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_Rises" title="The Dark Knight Rises">The Dark Knight Rises</a></i> or <i>Inception</i>, but that for <i>Interstellar</i>, they created the effects first, so that digital projectors could be used to display them behind the actors, rather than having the actors perform in front of <a href="/wiki/Green_screen" class="mw-redirect" title="Green screen">green screens</a>. Ultimately the film contained 850 visual effect shots at a resolution of 5600 x 4000 lines: 150 shots that were created in camera using digital projectors, and another 700 were created in post production. Of those, 620 were presented in IMAX, while the rest were anamorphic.</p><p>The Ranger, <i>Endurance</i>, and Lander spacecraft were created using <a href="/wiki/Miniature_effect" title="Miniature effect">miniature effects</a> by production designer Nathan Crowley in collaboration with effects company New Deal Studios, as opposed to using computer generated imagery, as Nolan felt they offered the best way to give the ships a tangible presence in space. Created through a combination of <a href="/wiki/3D_printing" title="3D printing">3D printing</a> and hand sculpting, the scale models earned the nickname &quot;maxatures&quot; by the crew due to their immense size; the 1/15th scale miniature of the Endurance module spanned over 7.6 m (25 feet), while a <a href="/wiki/Pyrotechnic" class="mw-redirect" title="Pyrotechnic">pyrotechnic</a> model of a portion of the craft was built at 1/5th scale. The Ranger and Lander miniatures spanned 14 m (46 feet) and over 15 m (50 feet), respectively. The miniatures were large enough for Hoyte van Hoytema to mount IMAX cameras directly onto the spacecraft, thus mimicking the look of NASA IMAX documentaries. The models were then attached to a six-axis <a href="/wiki/Gimbal" title="Gimbal">gimbal</a> on a motion control system that allowed an operator to manipulate their movements, which were filmed against background plates of space using <a href="/wiki/VistaVision" title="VistaVision">VistaVision</a> cameras on a smaller motion control rig. New Deal Studio&apos;s miniatures were used in 150 special effects shots.</p><p>Director Christopher Nolan said influences on <i>Interstellar</i> included the &quot;key touchstones&quot; of science fiction cinema: <i><a href="/wiki/Metropolis_(1927_film)" title="Metropolis (1927 film)">Metropolis</a></i> (1927), <i><a href="/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)" title="2001: A Space Odyssey (film)">2001: A Space Odyssey</a></i> (1968), and <i><a href="/wiki/Blade_Runner" title="Blade Runner">Blade Runner</a></i> (1982). About <i>2001</i>, Nolan said: &quot;The movies you grow up with, the culture you absorb through the decades, become part of your expectations while watching a film. So you can&apos;t make any film in a vacuum. We&apos;re making a science-fiction film... You can&apos;t pretend <i>2001</i> doesn&apos;t exist when you&apos;re making <i>Interstellar</i>.&quot; He also said that <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_(film)" title="Star Wars (film)">Star Wars</a></i> (1977) and <i><a href="/wiki/Alien_(film)" title="Alien (film)">Alien</a></i> (1979) influenced <i>Interstellar</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">&apos;</span>s production design: &quot;Those always stuck in my head as being how you need to approach science-fiction. It has to feel used&#x2014;as used and as real as the world we live in.&quot; <a href="/wiki/Andrei_Tarkovsky" title="Andrei Tarkovsky">Andrei Tarkovsky</a>&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Mirror_(1975_film)" title="The Mirror (1975 film)">The Mirror</a></i> (1975) influenced &quot;elemental things in the story to do with wind and dust and water&quot;.</p><p>Nolan compared <i>Interstellar</i> to <i><a href="/wiki/The_Treasure_of_the_Sierra_Madre_(film)" title="The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)">The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</a></i> (1948), as a film about human nature. He also sought to emulate films like <a href="/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/Jaws_(film)" title="Jaws (film)">Jaws</a></i> (1975) and <i><a href="/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind" title="Close Encounters of the Third Kind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a></i> (1977). He stated: &quot;When you say you&apos;re making a family film, it has all these pejorative connotations that it&apos;ll be somehow soft. But when I was a kid, these were family films in the best sense, and they were as edgy and incisive and challenging as anything else on the blockbuster spectrum. I wanted to bring that back in some way.&quot; He also cited the space drama <i><a href="/wiki/The_Right_Stuff_(film)" title="The Right Stuff (film)">The Right Stuff</a></i> (1983) as an example to follow, and screened it for the crew before production. To emulate that film, he sought to capture reflection on the <i>Interstellar</i> astronauts&apos; visors. For further inspiration grounded in real-world space travel, the director also invited former astronaut <a href="/wiki/Marsha_Ivins" title="Marsha Ivins">Marsha Ivins</a> to the set. Nolan and his crew studied the IMAX NASA documentaries of filmmaker <a href="/wiki/Toni_Myers" title="Toni Myers">Toni Myers</a> for visual reference of spacefaring missions, and sought to emulate the look of their use of IMAX cameras in the enclosed spaces of a spacecraft interior.</p><p>The setting of the farm in the Midwest was inspired by <a href="/wiki/Clark_Kent" title="Clark Kent">Clark Kent</a>&apos;s upbringing in <i><a href="/wiki/Man_of_Steel_(film)" title="Man of Steel (film)">Man of Steel</a></i>.

Second, that all the wild speculations... would spring from science and not from the fertile mind of a screenwriter.&quot; Nolan accepted these terms as long as they did not get in the way of making the movie. At one point, Thorne spent two weeks trying to talk Nolan out of an idea about a character traveling faster than light before Nolan finally gave up. According to Thorne, the element which has the highest degree of artistic freedom is the clouds of ice on one of the planets they visit, which are structures that probably go beyond the material strength that ice would be able to support.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Astrobiology" title="Astrobiology">Astrobiologist</a> <a href="/wiki/David_Grinspoon" title="David Grinspoon">David Grinspoon</a> criticized the dire &quot;blight&quot; situation on Earth portrayed in early scenes, pointing out that even with a voracious blight it would have taken millions of years to draw down the atmosphere&apos;s content of oxygen.

Thorne would provide pages of deeply sourced <a href="/wiki/Theoretical_Physics" class="mw-redirect" title="Theoretical Physics">theoretical equations</a> to the artists, who then wrote new CGI rendering software based on these equations to create accurate computer simulations of the <a href="/wiki/Gravitational_lensing" class="mw-redirect" title="Gravitational lensing">gravitational lensing</a> caused by these phenomena. Some individual frames took up to 100 hours to render, totalling to 800 terabytes of data for the movie. The resulting visual effect provided Thorne with new insight into the effects of gravitational lensing and <a href="/wiki/Accretion_disks" class="mw-redirect" title="Accretion disks">accretion disks</a> surrounding black holes, which led to the publication of three <a href="/wiki/Scientific_papers" class="mw-redirect" title="Scientific papers">scientific papers</a>.</p><p>Christopher Nolan was initially concerned that a scientifically accurate depiction of a black hole would not be visually comprehensible to an audience and would require the effects team to unrealistically alter its appearance. The visual representation of the black hole in the movie doesn&apos;t account for the <a href="/wiki/Doppler_effect" title="Doppler effect">Doppler effect</a>, which when added by the visual effects team, resulted in an asymmetrically lit black and blue black hole. Nolan didn&apos;t like the asymmetry caused by the Doppler effect and thought moviegoers wouldn&apos;t understand why it was asymmetrical, so the finished black hole ignored the Doppler effect. Nolan found the finished effect to be understandable, provided that he maintained consistent camera perspectives. &quot;What we found was as long as we didn&apos;t change the point of view too much, the camera position, we could get something very understandable&quot;.</p><p>The portrayal of what a wormhole would look like is considered scientifically correct. Rather than a two-dimensional hole in space, it is depicted as a sphere, showing a distorted view of the target galaxy. The accretion disk of the black hole was described by Thorne as &quot;anemic and at low temperature&#x2014;about the temperature of the surface of the sun,&quot; allowing it to emit appreciable light, but not enough gamma radiation and X-rays to threaten nearby astronauts and planets.</p><p>Correct depiction of <a href="/wiki/Penrose_process" title="Penrose process">Penrose process</a> was also praised.</p><p>The teaser trailer for <i>Interstellar</i> debuted <span class="nowrap">December 14</span>, 2013 and featured clips related to <a href="/wiki/Space_exploration" title="Space exploration">space exploration</a>, accompanied by a voiceover by Matthew McConaughey&apos;s character of Cooper.

Todd McCarthy, reviewing for <i><a href="/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter" title="The Hollywood Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a></i>, wrote, &quot;This grandly conceived and executed epic tries to give equal weight to intimate human emotions and speculation about the cosmos, with mixed results, but is never less than engrossing, and sometimes more than that.&quot; In his review for <i><a href="/wiki/The_Associated_Press" class="mw-redirect" title="The Associated Press">The Associated Press</a></i>, Jake Coyle praised the film for its &quot;big-screen grandeur,&quot; while finding some of the dialogue &quot;clunky&quot;.

In those moments, it suddenly dawns upon us that the ocean that rises up 90 degrees and comes at us like a wall is not just a special effect on some faraway planet, but a scenario all too close to home.&quot; Novelist and short story writer <a href="/wiki/George_R._R._Martin" title="George R.
