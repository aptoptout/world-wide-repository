In antiquity, the Greek historian <a href="/wiki/Herodotus" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts, Europe, Asia, and Libya (Africa), with the <a href="/wiki/Nile" title="Nile">Nile</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Rioni_River" title="Rioni River">River Phasis</a> forming their boundaries&#x2014;though he also states that some considered the <a href="/wiki/Don_River_(Russia)" title="Don River (Russia)">River Don</a>, rather than the <a href="/wiki/Rioni_River" title="Rioni River">Phasis</a>, as the boundary between Europe and Asia. Europe&apos;s eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer <a href="/wiki/Strabo" title="Strabo">Strabo</a> at the River Don. The <i><a href="/wiki/Jubilees" class="mw-redirect" title="Jubilees">Book of Jubilees</a></i> described the continents as the lands given by <a href="/wiki/Noah" title="Noah">Noah</a> to his three sons; Europe was defined as stretching from the <a href="/wiki/Pillars_of_Hercules" title="Pillars of Hercules">Pillars of Hercules</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Strait_of_Gibraltar" title="Strait of Gibraltar">Strait of Gibraltar</a>, separating it from <a href="/wiki/North_Africa" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>, to the Don, separating it from <a href="/wiki/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>.</p><p>A cultural definition of Europe as the lands of <a href="/wiki/Christendom" title="Christendom">Latin Christendom</a> coalesced in the 8th century, signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of Germanic traditions and Christian-Latin culture, defined partly in contrast with <a href="/wiki/Byzantium" title="Byzantium">Byzantium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Islam" title="Islam">Islam</a>, and limited to northern <a href="/wiki/Iberia" class="mw-redirect" title="Iberia">Iberia</a>, the British Isles, France, Christianised western Germany, the Alpine regions and northern and central Italy. The concept is one of the lasting legacies of the <a href="/wiki/Carolingian_Renaissance" title="Carolingian Renaissance">Carolingian Renaissance</a>: &quot;Europa&quot; often figures in the letters of Charlemagne&apos;s court scholar, <a href="/wiki/Alcuin" title="Alcuin">Alcuin</a>. This division&#x2014;as much cultural as geographical&#x2014;was used until the <a href="/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages" title="Late Middle Ages">Late Middle Ages</a>, when it was challenged by the <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Discovery" title="Age of Discovery">Age of Discovery</a>. The problem of redefining Europe was finally resolved in 1730 when, instead of waterways, the Swedish geographer and cartographer <a href="/wiki/Philip_Johan_von_Strahlenberg" title="Philip Johan von Strahlenberg">von Strahlenberg</a> proposed the <a href="/wiki/Ural_Mountains" title="Ural Mountains">Ural Mountains</a> as the most significant eastern boundary, a suggestion that found favour in <a href="/wiki/Tsardom_of_Russia" title="Tsardom of Russia">Russia</a> and throughout Europe.</p><p>Europe is now generally defined by geographers as the western part of Eurasia, with its boundaries marked by large bodies of water to the north, west and south; Europe&apos;s limits to the far east are usually taken to be the Urals, the <a href="/wiki/Ural_River" title="Ural River">Ural River</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Caspian_Sea" title="Caspian Sea">Caspian Sea</a>; to the southeast, including the <a href="/wiki/Caucasus_Mountains" title="Caucasus Mountains">Caucasus Mountains</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Black_Sea" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a> and the waterways connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p>Islands are generally grouped with the nearest continental landmass, hence <a href="/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> is generally considered to be part of Europe, while the nearby island of <a href="/wiki/Greenland" title="Greenland">Greenland</a> is usually assigned to <a href="/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>. Nevertheless, there are some exceptions based on sociopolitical and cultural differences. <a href="/wiki/Cyprus" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> is closest to <a href="/wiki/Anatolia" title="Anatolia">Anatolia (or Asia Minor)</a>, but is usually considered part of Europe both culturally and politically and currently is a member state of the EU. <a href="/wiki/Malta" title="Malta">Malta</a> was considered an island of North Africa for centuries.</p><p>The geographic boundary drawn between Europe and Asia in 1730 follows no international boundaries. As a result, attempts to organise Europe along political or economic lines have resulted in uses of the name in a geopolitically limiting way to refer only to the 28 member states of the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a>. Conversely, Europe has also been used in a very expansive way by the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_Europe" title="Council of Europe">Council of Europe</a> which has 47 member countries, some of which territorially over-reach the Ural and Bosphorus lines to include all of Russia and Turkey. In addition, people in the <a href="/wiki/British_Isles" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> may refer to <a href="/wiki/Continental_Europe" title="Continental Europe">&quot;continental&quot; or &quot;mainland&quot; Europe</a> as Europe.</p><p>In classical <a href="/wiki/Greek_mythology" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Europa_(mythology)" title="Europa (mythology)">Europa</a> was a <a href="/wiki/Phoenicia" title="Phoenicia">Phoenician</a> princess whom <a href="/wiki/Zeus" title="Zeus">Zeus</a> abducted after assuming the form of a dazzling white bull.

Discontent with the aristocracy and clergy&apos;s monopoly on political power in France resulted in the French Revolution and the establishment of the <a href="/wiki/French_First_Republic" title="French First Republic">First Republic</a> as a result of which the monarchy and many of the nobility perished during the initial <a href="/wiki/Reign_of_Terror" title="Reign of Terror">reign of terror</a>. <a href="/wiki/Napoleon" title="Napoleon">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> rose to power in the aftermath of the French Revolution and established the <a href="/wiki/First_French_Empire" title="First French Empire">First French Empire</a> that, during the <a href="/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, grew to encompass large parts of Europe before collapsing in 1815 with the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Waterloo" title="Battle of Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a>. <a href="/wiki/Napoleonic_Empire" class="mw-redirect" title="Napoleonic Empire">Napoleonic rule</a> resulted in the further dissemination of the ideals of the French Revolution, including that of the <a href="/wiki/Nation_state" title="Nation state">nation-state</a>, as well as the widespread adoption of the French models of <a href="/wiki/Centralised_government" class="mw-redirect" title="Centralised government">administration</a>, <a href="/wiki/Napoleonic_code" class="mw-redirect" title="Napoleonic code">law</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Education_in_France" title="Education in France">education</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna" title="Congress of Vienna">Congress of Vienna</a>, convened after Napoleon&apos;s downfall, established a new <a href="/wiki/Balance_of_power_(international_relations)" title="Balance of power (international relations)">balance of power</a> in Europe centred on the five &quot;<a href="/wiki/Great_Power" class="mw-redirect" title="Great Power">Great Powers</a>&quot;: the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>, <a href="/wiki/Prussia" title="Prussia">Prussia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Austrian_Empire" title="Austrian Empire">Austria</a>, and Russia. This balance would remain in place until the <a href="/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848" title="Revolutions of 1848">Revolutions of 1848</a>, during which liberal uprisings affected all of Europe except for Russia and the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>. These revolutions were eventually put down by conservative elements and few reforms resulted. The year 1859 saw the unification of Romania, as a nation-state, from smaller principalities.

As the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire seemed imminent, the <a href="/wiki/Great_Power" class="mw-redirect" title="Great Power">Great Powers</a> struggled to safeguard their strategic and commercial interests in the Ottoman domains. The <a href="/wiki/Russian_Empire" title="Russian Empire">Russian Empire</a> stood to benefit from the decline, whereas the <a href="/wiki/Habsburg_Empire" class="mw-redirect" title="Habsburg Empire">Habsburg Empire</a> and <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Britain</a> perceived the preservation of the Ottoman Empire to be in their best interests.

The invention and implementation of new technologies resulted in rapid urban growth, mass employment, and the rise of a new working class. Reforms in social and economic spheres followed, including the <a href="/wiki/Factory_Acts" title="Factory Acts">first laws</a> on <a href="/wiki/Child_labour" title="Child labour">child labour</a>, the legalisation of <a href="/wiki/Trade_union" title="Trade union">trade unions</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="Abolitionism in the United Kingdom">abolition of slavery</a>. In Britain, the <a href="/wiki/Public_Health_Act_of_1875" class="mw-redirect" title="Public Health Act of 1875">Public Health Act of 1875</a> was passed, which significantly improved living conditions in many British cities. Europe&apos;s population increased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900. The last major famine recorded in Western Europe, the <a href="/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland)" title="Great Famine (Ireland)">Irish Potato Famine</a>, caused death and mass emigration of millions of Irish people. In the 19th century, 70&#xA0;million people left Europe in migrations to various European colonies abroad and to the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>. Demographic growth meant that, by 1900, Europe&apos;s share of the world&apos;s population was 25%.</p><p>Two World Wars and an economic depression dominated the first half of the 20th century. World War I was fought between 1914 and 1918.

This and the <a href="/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929" title="Wall Street Crash of 1929">Wall Street Crash of 1929</a> brought about the worldwide Great Depression.

The <a href="/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Poland" title="Soviet invasion of Poland">Soviet invasion of Poland</a> started on 17 September and Poland fell soon thereafter. On 24 September, the Soviet Union attacked the <a href="/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Baltic_states" title="Occupation of the Baltic states">Baltic countries</a> and later, Finland. The British hoped to land at <a href="/wiki/Battles_of_Narvik" title="Battles of Narvik">Narvik</a> and send troops to aid Finland, but their primary objective in the landing was to encircle Germany and cut the Germans off from Scandinavian resources. Around the same time, Germany moved troops into Denmark.

It has a higher ratio of coast to landmass than any other continent or subcontinent. Its maritime borders consist of the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean, Black, and Caspian Seas to the south. Land relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions are more mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high <a href="/wiki/Alps" title="Alps">Alps</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pyrenees" title="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Carpathian_Mountains" title="Carpathian Mountains">Carpathians</a>, through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. This extended lowland is known as the <a href="/wiki/Great_European_Plain" class="mw-redirect" title="Great European Plain">Great European Plain</a>, and at its heart lies the <a href="/wiki/North_German_Plain" title="North German Plain">North German Plain</a>. An arc of uplands also exists along the north-western seaboard, which begins in the western parts of the islands of <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Britain</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, and then continues along the mountainous, fjord-cut spine of Norway.</p><p>This description is simplified.

Sub-regions like <a href="/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a>, Britain, and Ireland are special cases. The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of Europe, while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off.</p><p>Europe lies mainly in the <a href="/wiki/Temperate" class="mw-redirect" title="Temperate">temperate</a> climate zones, being subjected to <a href="/wiki/Prevailing_westerlies" class="mw-redirect" title="Prevailing westerlies">prevailing westerlies</a>. The climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_Stream" title="Gulf Stream">Gulf Stream</a>. The Gulf Stream is nicknamed &quot;Europe&apos;s central heating&quot;, because it makes Europe&apos;s climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be. The Gulf Stream not only carries warm water to Europe&apos;s coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>Therefore, the average temperature throughout the year of Naples is 16&#xA0;&#xB0;C (60.8&#xA0;&#xB0;F), while it is only 12&#xA0;&#xB0;C (53.6&#xA0;&#xB0;F) in New York City which is almost on the same latitude. Berlin, Germany; Calgary, Canada; and Irkutsk, in the Asian part of Russia, lie on around the same latitude; January temperatures in Berlin average around 8&#xA0;&#xB0;C (15&#xA0;&#xB0;F) higher than those in Calgary, and they are almost 22&#xA0;&#xB0;C (40&#xA0;&#xB0;F) higher than average temperatures in Irkutsk. Similarly, northern parts of Scotland have a tempertate marine climate. The yearly average temperature in city of Inverness is 9.05 degrees Celsius (48.3 degrees Fahrenheit). However, Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, is on roughly the same latitude and has an average temperature of -6.5 degrees Celsius (20.3 degrees Fahrenheit), giving it a nearly subarctic climate.</p><p>The geological history of Europe traces back to the formation of the <a href="/wiki/Baltic_Shield" title="Baltic Shield">Baltic Shield</a> (Fennoscandia) and the <a href="/wiki/Sarmatian_craton" class="mw-redirect" title="Sarmatian craton">Sarmatian craton</a>, both around 2.25&#xA0;billion years ago, followed by the <a href="/wiki/Volgo%E2%80%93Uralia" title="Volgo&#x2013;Uralia">Volgo&#x2013;Uralia</a> shield, the three together leading to the <a href="/wiki/East_European_craton" class="mw-redirect" title="East European craton">East European craton</a> (&#x2248; <a href="/wiki/Baltica" title="Baltica">Baltica</a>) which became a part of the <a href="/wiki/Supercontinent" title="Supercontinent">supercontinent</a> <a href="/wiki/Columbia_(supercontinent)" title="Columbia (supercontinent)">Columbia</a>. Around 1.1&#xA0;billion years ago, Baltica and Arctica (as part of the <a href="/wiki/Laurentia" title="Laurentia">Laurentia</a> block) became joined to <a href="/wiki/Rodinia" title="Rodinia">Rodinia</a>, later resplitting around 550&#xA0;million years ago to reform as Baltica. Around 440&#xA0;million years ago <a href="/wiki/Euramerica" title="Euramerica">Euramerica</a> was formed from Baltica and Laurentia; a further joining with <a href="/wiki/Gondwana" title="Gondwana">Gondwana</a> then leading to the formation of <a href="/wiki/Pangea" class="mw-redirect" title="Pangea">Pangea</a>. Around 190&#xA0;million years ago, Gondwana and <a href="/wiki/Laurasia" title="Laurasia">Laurasia</a> split apart due to the widening of the Atlantic Ocean. Finally, and very soon afterwards, Laurasia itself split up again, into Laurentia (North America) and the Eurasian continent. The land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time, via <a href="/wiki/Greenland" title="Greenland">Greenland</a>, leading to interchange of animal species. From around 50&#xA0;million years ago, rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of Europe, and its connections with continents such as Asia. Europe&apos;s present shape dates to the late <a href="/wiki/Tertiary_period" class="mw-redirect" title="Tertiary period">Tertiary period</a> about five million years ago.</p><p>The geology of Europe is hugely varied and complex, and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent, from the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Highlands" title="Scottish Highlands">Scottish Highlands</a> to the rolling <a href="/wiki/Plain" title="Plain">plains</a> of Hungary. Europe&apos;s most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous <a href="/wiki/Southern_Europe" title="Southern Europe">Southern Europe</a> and a vast, partially underwater, northern plain ranging from Ireland in the west to the <a href="/wiki/Ural_Mountains" title="Ural Mountains">Ural Mountains</a> in the east.

The conditions for growth are very favourable. In the north, the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_Stream" title="Gulf Stream">Gulf Stream</a> and <a href="/wiki/North_Atlantic_Current" title="North Atlantic Current">North Atlantic Drift</a> warm the continent. Southern Europe could be described as having a warm, but mild climate. There are frequent summer droughts in this region. Mountain ridges also affect the conditions. Some of these (<a href="/wiki/Alps" title="Alps">Alps</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pyrenees" title="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a>) are oriented east-west and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior.

Few corners of mainland Europe have not been grazed by <a href="/wiki/Livestock" title="Livestock">livestock</a> at some point in time, and the cutting down of the pre-agricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems.</p><p>Probably 80 to 90 percent of Europe was once covered by forest.

Though over half of Europe&apos;s original forests disappeared through the centuries of <a href="/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">deforestation</a>, Europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest, such as the <a href="/wiki/Temperate_broadleaf_and_mixed_forest" title="Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest">broadlef and mixed</a> forests, <a href="/wiki/Taiga" title="Taiga">taiga</a> of Scandinavia and Russia, mixed <a href="/wiki/Rainforest" title="Rainforest">rainforests</a> of the Caucasus and the <a href="/wiki/Cork_oak" class="mw-redirect" title="Cork oak">Cork oak</a> forests in the western Mediterranean. During recent times, deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted. However, in many cases monoculture <a href="/wiki/Plantation" title="Plantation">plantations</a> of <a href="/wiki/Pinophyta" title="Pinophyta">conifers</a> have replaced the original mixed natural forest, because these grow quicker. The plantations now cover vast areas of land, but offer poorer habitats for many European forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure. The amount of natural forest in Western Europe is just 2&#x2013;3% or less, in European Russia 5&#x2013;10%. The country with the smallest percentage of forested area is <a href="/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> (1%), while the most forested country is Finland (77%).</p><p>In temperate Europe, mixed forest with both <a href="/wiki/Flowering_plant" title="Flowering plant">broadleaf</a> and coniferous trees dominate.
