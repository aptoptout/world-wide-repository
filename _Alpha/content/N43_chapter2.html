On the way back, his children adopt six direwolf pups, the animal of his <a href="/wiki/Sigil_(disambiguation)" class="mw-redirect mw-disambig" title="Sigil (disambiguation)">sigil</a>. There are three male and two female direwolf pups, as well as an albino runt, which aligns with his three trueborn sons, two trueborn daughters, and one bastard son. That night, Ned receives word of the death of his mentor, Lord <a href="/wiki/Jon_Arryn" class="mw-redirect" title="Jon Arryn">Jon Arryn</a>, the principal advisor to Ned&apos;s childhood friend, King <a href="/wiki/Robert_Baratheon" title="Robert Baratheon">Robert Baratheon</a>. During his own visit to Ned&apos;s castle of <a href="/wiki/Winterfell" class="mw-redirect" title="Winterfell">Winterfell</a>, Robert recruits Ned to replace Arryn as the King&apos;s Hand. Ned is reluctant, but agrees to go when he learns that Arryn&apos;s widow <a href="/wiki/Lysa_Tully" class="mw-redirect" title="Lysa Tully">Lysa</a> believes Queen <a href="/wiki/Cersei_Lannister" title="Cersei Lannister">Cersei Lannister</a> and <a href="/wiki/House_Lannister" class="mw-redirect" title="House Lannister">her family</a> poisoned Arryn. Shortly thereafter, Ned&apos;s son <a href="/wiki/Bran_Stark" title="Bran Stark">Bran</a> inadvertently discovers Cersei <a href="/wiki/Incest" title="Incest">in coitus</a> with her twin brother <a href="/wiki/Jaime_Lannister" title="Jaime Lannister">Jaime Lannister</a>, who throws Bran from the tower to conceal their affair. Ned and his daughters <a href="/wiki/Sansa_Stark" title="Sansa Stark">Sansa</a> and <a href="/wiki/Arya_Stark" title="Arya Stark">Arya</a> depart for the royal capital of <a href="/wiki/King%27s_Landing_(A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire)" class="mw-redirect" title="King&apos;s Landing (A Song of Ice and Fire)">King&apos;s Landing</a>, while his wife <a href="/wiki/Catelyn_Stark" title="Catelyn Stark">Catelyn</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Coma" title="Coma">comatose</a> Bran, and their other sons <a href="/wiki/Robb_Stark" title="Robb Stark">Robb</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rickon_Stark" class="mw-redirect" title="Rickon Stark">Rickon</a> remain at Winterfell.</p><p>During the journey south, a physical altercation between Arya and Robert&apos;s son, Prince <a href="/wiki/Joffrey_Baratheon" title="Joffrey Baratheon">Joffrey</a>, to whom Sansa has been betrothed, increases both the tension between the Starks and the Lannisters and the sibling rivalry between Arya and Sansa. Arya&apos;s direwolf Nymeria attacks Joffrey to protect her, and Arya chases Nymeria away to protect her from the Lannisters&apos; wrath, wherefore Sansa&apos;s direwolf Lady is executed in Nymeria&apos;s place. At Winterfell, an <a href="/wiki/Assassin" class="mw-redirect" title="Assassin">assassin</a> attempts to kill Bran, and Catelyn departs for King&apos;s Landing to bring word of this to Ned. Shortly after that, Bran awakens as a <a href="/wiki/Paraplegic" class="mw-redirect" title="Paraplegic">paraplegic</a>, with no memory of the cause of his fall. At King&apos;s Landing, Ned meets the King&apos;s advisors, including <a href="/wiki/Petyr_Baelish" title="Petyr Baelish">Petyr Baelish</a>, known as Littlefinger, the royal treasurer, and <a href="/wiki/Varys" title="Varys">Varys</a>, the master of secrets.

Upon Catelyn&apos;s arrival in King&apos;s Landing, she is brought to Baelish, who identifies <a href="/wiki/Tyrion_Lannister" title="Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion Lannister</a>, the dwarf brother of Cersei and Jaime, as the owner of the dagger used against Bran, and agrees to help Ned investigate the possibility of Lannister treason. During her return to Winterfell, Catelyn meets Tyrion by chance, arrests him, and takes him to her sister Lysa Arryn&apos;s stronghold, where Tyrion demands <a href="/wiki/Trial_by_combat" title="Trial by combat">trial by combat</a> and regains his freedom when his champion, a mercenary named <a href="/wiki/Bronn_(character)" title="Bronn (character)">Bronn</a>, is victorious. In retaliation for Tyrion&apos;s abduction, his father Lord <a href="/wiki/Tywin_Lannister" title="Tywin Lannister">Tywin Lannister</a> sends soldiers on raids across Catelyn&apos;s family lands.</p><p>Ned eventually discovers that Robert&apos;s legal heirs, including Joffrey, are in fact Cersei&apos;s children by Jaime and that Jon Arryn was killed to conceal his discovery of that. Ned offers Cersei a chance to flee before he informs Robert, but she uses this chance to arrange Robert&apos;s death in a hunting accident. Ned, made lord-regent by Robert&apos;s will, enlists Littlefinger&apos;s help to secure the loyalty and assistance of the city guards to challenge Joffrey&apos;s claim on the throne; but Littlefinger betrays him, resulting in Ned&apos;s arrest, the death of his men, and Sansa&apos;s imprisonment by the Lannisters. Arya escapes, and Joffrey is crowned King of the Seven Kingdoms. Ned eventually agrees to falsely confess to high treason and join the <a href="/wiki/Night%27s_Watch" class="mw-redirect" title="Night&apos;s Watch">Night&apos;s Watch</a> in exchange for Sansa&apos;s safety, but is instead beheaded on Joffrey&apos;s orders.</p><p>Robb Stark has gathered an army and marched south in response to his father&apos;s arrest; and upon learning of Ned&apos;s death, attempts to raise further support from and to aid his maternal grandfather, Lord <a href="/wiki/Hoster_Tully" class="mw-redirect" title="Hoster Tully">Hoster Tully</a>.

At the Wall, Jon unites the recruits against their harsh instructor and protects the cowardly but good-natured and intelligent <a href="/wiki/Samwell_Tarly" title="Samwell Tarly">Samwell Tarly</a>. Jon hopes that his combat skills will earn him assignment to the Rangers, the military arm of the Night&apos;s Watch, but instead is made a steward (and thus potential successor) to the leader of the Watch, Lord Commander <a href="/wiki/Jeor_Mormont" class="mw-redirect" title="Jeor Mormont">Jeor Mormont</a>. Benjen, who had led a small party of Rangers beyond the Wall, fails to return, and six months later, the dead bodies of two of the Rangers from his party are recovered beyond the Wall, but soon re-animate as <a href="/wiki/Wight" title="Wight">wights</a>, which kill six men and threaten Mormont, who is saved by Jon.</p><p>When word of his father&apos;s execution reaches Jon, he attempts to join Robb against the Lannisters but is prevented by his comrades and persuaded by Mormont to remain loyal to the Watch. Mormont then declares his intention to find Benjen &#x2014; dead or alive &#x2014; and to investigate the disappearance of many wildlings and the dark rumors surrounding &quot;the King-Beyond-the-Wall&quot;: a deserter from the Night&apos;s Watch known as <a href="/wiki/Mance_Rayder" class="mw-redirect" title="Mance Rayder">Mance Rayder</a>.</p><p>In Pentos, a city-state of Essos, a continent to the <a href="/wiki/East" title="East">east</a> of Westeros, <a href="/wiki/Viserys_Targaryen" title="Viserys Targaryen">Viserys Targaryen</a>, son of the king overthrown by Robert Baratheon, betroths his sister <a href="/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen" title="Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys</a> to <a href="/wiki/Khal_Drogo" title="Khal Drogo">Khal Drogo</a>, a warlord of the nomadic <a href="/wiki/Dothraki" class="mw-redirect" title="Dothraki">Dothraki</a>, in exchange for the use of Drogo&apos;s army to reclaim the throne of Westeros. Illyrio, a wealthy merchant who has been supporting the penniless Targaryens and brokered the marriage, gives Daenerys three petrified <a href="/wiki/Dragon" title="Dragon">dragon</a> eggs as a wedding gift. <a href="/wiki/Jorah_Mormont" title="Jorah Mormont">Jorah Mormont</a>, a knight exiled from Westeros, joins Viserys as an adviser. Initially terrified of her new husband and his people, Daenerys eventually embraces the role of Drogo&apos;s queen. When Drogo shows little interest in conquering Westeros, Viserys tries to browbeat his sister into coercing Drogo, but she refuses. When Viserys publicly threatens Daenerys, Drogo executes him. After that, an assassin seeking King Robert&apos;s favor attempts to poison Daenerys and her unborn child, and Drogo agrees to help her conquer Westeros. While sacking villages to fund the invasion, Drogo is wounded, and Daenerys commands a captive <a href="/wiki/Cunning_folk" title="Cunning folk">folk healer</a> to save him. When he is beyond saving, the healer, angered by the Dothraki raids, sacrifices Daenerys&apos; unborn child to power the spell to save Drogo&apos;s life, which restores Drogo&apos;s health but leaves him in a vegetative state. Most of the Dothraki army departs to follow a new leader. Daenerys smothers Drogo with a pillow and orders the healer tied to Drogo&apos;s funeral pyre. She places her three dragon eggs on the pyre, enters it herself, and emerges unscathed with three newly hatched dragons suckling at her breasts. The remaining Dothraki and Jorah Mormont, awe-struck, swear allegiance to her.</p><p>Throughout the novel, characters are often faced with decisions that match one redeemable trait against another. <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> outlines characters who are frequently &quot;forced to choose between their love for those close to them and the greater interests of honour, duty and the realm.&quot; In Westeros, Ned ultimately decides to venture south with Robert, leaving much of his family in Winterfell. At the Wall, Jon wrestles with the predicament of joining his half-brother Robb in rebellion or staying with his sworn brothers in the Nights Watch. Daenerys has issue with the Dothraki treatment of those they conquered in Essos. These conflicts characters encounter oftentimes reflect inconsistent decision making. Catelyn initially is overwhelmed by grief and does not leave Bran&apos;s bedside while he is comatose, ignoring her political responsibilities, choosing family over duty. But soon after, Catelyn leaves Bran and her family for Kings Landing to inform Ned of potential Lannister treason, effectively displaying a more duty fulfilling role. Family, duty, and honor play major roles in conflicts that arise in the story arc, and qualities traditionally categorized as noble oppose each other in resolution. Character decision conflicts and consequence analysis are particular to how Martin wants to portray fantasy.</p><p>Martin characteristically deviates from the traditional fantasy model and clear-cut lines of good versus evil. Martin reflects: &quot;I think the battle between good and evil is fought largely within the individual human heart, by the decisions that we make. It&apos;s not like evil dresses up in black clothing and you know, they&apos;re really ugly&quot;. This viewpoint characterizes the book and is evident in the actions of several different families which frequently have conflicts with each other. The Starks&apos; and Lannisters&apos; conflict is a central component of the novel, and the reader receives points of view from both sides. Likewise, Daenerys&apos; storyline develops around the Targaryen&apos;s upheaval in Westeros, in which the Starks played a significant role. Martin argues:</p><p>Having multiple viewpoints is crucial to the grayness of the characters. You have to be able to see the struggle from both sides, because real human beings in a war have all these processes of self-justification, telling ourselves why what we&apos;re doing is the right thing.</p><p>Each chapter concentrates on the <a href="/wiki/Third-person_limited_narrative" class="mw-redirect" title="Third-person limited narrative">third person limited</a> <a href="/wiki/Point_of_view_(literature)" class="mw-redirect" title="Point of view (literature)">point of view</a> of a single character; the book presents the perspective of eight main characters. Additionally, a minor character provides the prologue. Chapter headings indicate the perspective.</p><p>In the later books, certain viewpoint characters are added while others are removed.</p><p>The novel has been published in multiple editions in hardcover, paperback, e-book, and audio book form. In June 2000, <a href="/wiki/Meisha_Merlin" class="mw-redirect" title="Meisha Merlin">Meisha Merlin</a> published a limited edition of the book, fully illustrated by Jeffrey Jones.</p><p><i>A Game of Thrones</i> and the subsequent novels in the <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> series have been adapted in a HBO television series, a comics series, several card, board and video games, and other media.</p><p><i>A Game of Thrones</i> has received much critical acclaim. Lauren K. Nathan of the <a href="/wiki/Associated_Press" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> wrote that the book &quot;grip[s] the reader from Page One&quot; and is set in a &quot;magnificent&quot; fantasy world that is &quot;mystical, but still believable.&quot; Steve Perry told readers of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Oregonian" title="The Oregonian">The Oregonian</a></i> that the plot is &quot;complex and fascinating&quot; and the book is &quot;rich and colorful&quot; with &quot;all the elements of a great fantasy novel&quot;.
