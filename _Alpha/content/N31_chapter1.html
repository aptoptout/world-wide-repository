<p><b>Bitcoin</b> is a digital asset and a <a href="/wiki/Payment_system" title="Payment system">payment system</a> invented by <a href="/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto" title="Satoshi Nakamoto">Satoshi Nakamoto</a>. Nakamoto unveiled the idea in 2008 to an obscure internet mailing list, and released it as <a href="/wiki/Open-source_software" title="Open-source software">open-source software</a> in 2009. There have been several high profile claims to the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto; however, none of them have provided proof beyond doubt that back up their claims.</p>
<p>The system is <a href="/wiki/Peer-to-peer" title="Peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a> and transactions take place between users directly, without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network <a href="/wiki/Node_(networking)" title="Node (networking)">nodes</a> and recorded in a public <a href="/wiki/Distributed_database" title="Distributed database">distributed ledger</a> called the <i>blockchain</i>, which uses bitcoin as its <a href="/wiki/Unit_of_account" title="Unit of account">unit of account</a>. Since the system works without a central repository or single administrator, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury" title="United States Department of the Treasury">U.S. Treasury</a> categorizes bitcoin as a decentralized <a href="/wiki/Virtual_currency" title="Virtual currency">virtual currency</a>. Bitcoin is often called the first <a href="/wiki/Cryptocurrency" title="Cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a>, although prior systems existed and it is more correctly described as the first decentralized <a href="/wiki/Digital_currency" title="Digital currency">digital currency</a>. Bitcoin is the largest of its kind in terms of total market value.</p>
<p>Bitcoins are created as a reward for payment processing work in which users offer their computing power to verify and record payments into a public ledger. This activity is called <i>mining</i> and miners are rewarded with transaction fees and newly created bitcoins. Besides being obtained by mining, bitcoins can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. When sending bitcoins, users can pay an optional transaction fee to the miners.</p>
<p>In February 2015, the number of merchants accepting bitcoin for products and services passed 100,000. Instead of 2&#x2013;3% typically imposed by <a href="/wiki/Credit_card" title="Credit card">credit card</a> processors, merchants accepting bitcoins often pay fees in the range from 0% to less than 2%. Despite the fourfold increase in the number of merchants accepting bitcoin in 2014, the cryptocurrency did not have much momentum in retail transactions. The <a href="/wiki/European_Banking_Authority" title="European Banking Authority">European Banking Authority</a> and other sources have warned that bitcoin users are not protected by refund rights or <a href="/wiki/Chargeback" title="Chargeback">chargebacks</a>. The use of bitcoin by criminals has attracted the attention of financial regulators, legislative bodies, law enforcement, and media. Criminal activities are primarily centered around <a href="/wiki/Darknet_market" title="Darknet market">darknet markets</a> and theft, though officials in countries such as the United States also recognize that bitcoin can provide legitimate financial services.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology_and_orthography">Etymology and orthography</span></h2>
<p>The word <i>bitcoin</i> occurred in the <a href="/wiki/White_paper" title="White paper">white paper</a> that defined bitcoin published in 2008. It is a <a href="/wiki/Compound_(linguistics)" title="Compound (linguistics)">compound</a> of the words <i><a href="/wiki/Bit" title="Bit">bit</a></i> and <i>coin</i>. The white paper frequently uses the shorter <i>coin</i>.</p>
<p>There is no uniform convention for <i>bitcoin</i> capitalization. Some sources use <i>Bitcoin</i>, capitalized, to refer to the technology and <a href="/wiki/Computer_network" title="Computer network">network</a> and <i>bitcoin</i>, lowercase, to refer to the unit of account. <i><a href="/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal" title="The Wall Street Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Chronicle_of_Higher_Education" title="The Chronicle of Higher Education">The Chronicle of Higher Education</a></i>, and the <i><a href="/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary" title="Oxford English Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a></i> advocate use of lowercase <i>bitcoin</i> in all cases. This article follows the latter convention.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Design">Design</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Blockchain">Blockchain</span></h3>

<p>The <i>blockchain</i> is a public <a href="/wiki/Ledger" title="Ledger">ledger</a> that records bitcoin transactions. A novel solution accomplishes this without any trusted central authority: maintenance of the blockchain is performed by a <a href="/wiki/Computer_network" title="Computer network">network</a> of communicating <a href="/wiki/Node_(networking)" title="Node (networking)">nodes</a> running bitcoin software. Transactions of the form <i>payer X sends Y bitcoins to payee Z</i> are <a href="/wiki/Broadcasting_(networking)" title="Broadcasting (networking)">broadcast</a> to this network using readily available software applications. Network nodes can validate transactions, add them to their copy of the ledger, and then broadcast these ledger additions to other nodes. The blockchain is a <a href="/wiki/Distributed_database" title="Distributed database">distributed database</a> &#x2013; to achieve independent verification of the chain of ownership of any and every bitcoin (amount), each network node stores its own copy of the blockchain. Approximately six times per hour, a new group of accepted transactions, a block, is created, added to the blockchain, and quickly published to all nodes. This allows bitcoin software to determine when a particular bitcoin amount has been spent, which is necessary in order to prevent <a href="/wiki/Double-spending" title="Double-spending">double-spending</a> in an environment without central oversight. Whereas a conventional ledger records the transfers of actual <a href="/wiki/Banknote" title="Banknote">bills</a> or <a href="/wiki/Promissory_note" title="Promissory note">promissory notes</a> that exist apart from it, the blockchain is the only place that bitcoins can be said to exist in the form of unspent outputs of transactions.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Units">Units</span></h3>
<p>The unit of account of the bitcoin system is bitcoin. As of 2014, symbols used to represent bitcoin are BTC, XBT, and <span class="nowrap"><a href="/wiki/File:BitcoinSign.svg" class="image"><img alt="BitcoinSign.svg" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/BitcoinSign.svg/9px-BitcoinSign.svg.png" width="9" height="12" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/BitcoinSign.svg/14px-BitcoinSign.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/BitcoinSign.svg/18px-BitcoinSign.svg.png 2x" data-file-width="274" data-file-height="360"></a></span>. Small amounts of bitcoin used as alternative units are millibitcoin (mBTC), microbitcoin (&#xB5;BTC), and satoshi. Named in homage to bitcoin&apos;s creator, a <i>satoshi</i> is the smallest amount within bitcoin representing 0.00000001 bitcoin, one hundred millionth of a bitcoin. A <i>millibitcoin</i> equals to 0.001 bitcoin, one thousandth of bitcoin. One <i>microbitcoin</i> equals to 0.000001 bitcoin, one millionth of a bitcoin. A microbitcoin is sometimes referred to as a <i>bit</i>.</p>
<p>In October 2014, the <a href="/wiki/Bitcoin_Foundation" title="Bitcoin Foundation">Bitcoin Foundation</a> disseminated a plan to apply for an <a href="/wiki/ISO_4217" title="ISO 4217">ISO 4217</a> currency code for bitcoin, and mentioned BTC and XBT as the leading candidates.</p>
<p>A proposal was submitted to the <a href="/wiki/Unicode_Consortium" title="Unicode Consortium">Unicode Consortium</a> in October 2015 to add a codepoint for the symbol. It is in the pipeline for position 20BF (&#x20BF;) in the <a href="/wiki/Currency_Symbols" class="mw-redirect" title="Currency Symbols">Currency Symbols</a> block.</p>

Simplified chain of ownership. In reality, a transaction can have more than one input and more than one output.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Ownership of bitcoins implies that a user can spend bitcoins associated with a specific address. To do so, a payer must <a href="/wiki/Digital_signature" title="Digital signature">digitally sign</a> the transaction using the corresponding <a href="/wiki/Private_key" class="mw-redirect" title="Private key">private key</a>. Without knowledge of the private key, the transaction cannot be signed and bitcoins cannot be spent. The network verifies the signature using the <a href="/wiki/Public_key" class="mw-redirect" title="Public key">public key</a>.</p>
<p>If the private key is lost, the <a href="/wiki/Bitcoin_network" title="Bitcoin network">bitcoin network</a> will not recognize any other evidence of ownership; the coins are then unusable, and thus effectively lost. For example, in 2013 one user claimed to have lost 7,500 bitcoins, worth $7.5 million at the time, when he accidentally discarded a hard drive containing his private key.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Transactions">Transactions</span></h3>

<p>A transaction must have one or more inputs. For the transaction to be valid, every input must be an unspent output of a previous transaction. Every input must be digitally signed. The use of multiple inputs corresponds to the use of multiple coins in a cash transaction. A transaction can also have multiple outputs, allowing one to make multiple payments in one go. A transaction output can be specified as an arbitrary multiple of satoshi. As in a cash transaction, the sum of inputs (coins used to pay) can exceed the intended sum of payments. In such a case, an additional output is used, returning the change back to the payer. Any input satoshis not accounted for in the transaction outputs become the transaction fee.</p>
<p>To send money to a bitcoin address, users can click links on webpages; this is accomplished with a provisional bitcoin <a href="/wiki/URI_scheme" class="mw-redirect" title="URI scheme">URI scheme</a> using a template registered with <a href="/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority" title="Internet Assigned Numbers Authority">IANA</a>. Bitcoin clients like Electrum and Armory support bitcoin URIs. Mobile clients recognize bitcoin URIs in <a href="/wiki/QR_code" title="QR code">QR codes</a>, so that the user does not have to type the bitcoin address and amount in manually. The <a href="/wiki/QR_code" title="QR code">QR code</a> is generated from the user input based on the payment amount. The QR code is displayed on the mobile device screen and can be scanned by a second mobile device.</p>

<p><i>Mining</i> is a record-keeping service. Miners keep the blockchain consistent, complete, and unalterable by repeatedly verifying and collecting newly broadcast transactions into a new group of transactions called a <i>block</i>. Each block contains a <a href="/wiki/Cryptographic_hash" class="mw-redirect" title="Cryptographic hash">cryptographic hash</a> of the previous block, using the <a href="/wiki/SHA-256" class="mw-redirect" title="SHA-256">SHA-256</a> hashing algorithm, which &quot;chains&quot; it to the previous block thus giving the blockchain its name.</p>
<p>In order to be accepted by the rest of the network, a new block must contain a so-called <i><a href="/wiki/Proof-of-work" class="mw-redirect" title="Proof-of-work">proof-of-work</a></i>. The proof-of-work requires miners to find a number called a <i><a href="/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce" title="Cryptographic nonce">nonce</a></i>, such that when the block content is <a href="/wiki/Cryptographic_hash" class="mw-redirect" title="Cryptographic hash">hashed</a> along with the nonce, the result is numerically smaller than the network&apos;s <i>difficulty target</i>. This proof is easy for any node in the network to verify, but extremely time-consuming to generate, as for a secure cryptographic hash, miners must try many different nonce values (usually the sequence of tested values is 0, 1, 2, 3, &#x2026;) before meeting the difficulty target.</p>
<p>Every 2016 blocks (approximately 14 days), the difficulty target is adjusted based on the network&apos;s recent performance, with the aim of keeping the average time between new blocks at ten minutes. In this way the system automatically adapts to the total amount of mining power on the network.</p>
<p>Between 1 March 2014 and 1 March 2015, the average number of nonces miners had to try before creating a new block increased from 16.4 quintillion to 200.5 quintillion.</p>
<p>The proof-of-work system, alongside the chaining of blocks, makes modifications of the blockchain extremely hard, as an attacker must modify all subsequent blocks in order for the modifications of one block to be accepted. As new blocks are mined all the time, the difficulty of modifying a block increases as time passes and the number of subsequent blocks (also called <i>confirmations</i> of the given block) increases.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Practicalities">Practicalities</span></h4>
<p>It has become common for miners to join <a href="/wiki/Mining_pool" title="Mining pool">mining pools</a>, which combine the computational resources of their members in order to increase the frequency of generating new blocks. The reward for each block is then split proportionately among the members, creating a more predictable stream of income for each miner without necessarily changing their long-term average income, although a fee may be charged for the service.</p>
<p>The rewards of mining have led to ever-more-specialized technology being utilized. The most efficient mining hardware makes use of custom designed <a href="/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit" title="Application-specific integrated circuit">application-specific integrated circuits</a>, which outperform general-purpose <a href="/wiki/Central_processing_unit" title="Central processing unit">CPUs</a> while using less power. As of 2015, a miner who is not using purpose-built hardware is unlikely to earn enough to cover the cost of the electricity used in their efforts, even if they are a member of a pool.</p>
<p>As of 2015, even if all miners used energy-efficient processors, the combined electricity consumption would be 1.46 terawatt-hours per year&#x2014;equal to the consumption of about 135,000 American homes. In 2013, electricity use was estimated to be 0.36 terawatt-hours per year or the equivalent of powering 31,000 US homes.</p>

<p>The successful miner finding the new block is rewarded with newly created bitcoins and transaction fees. As of 28 November 2012, the reward amounted to 25 newly created bitcoins per block added to the blockchain. To claim the reward, a special transaction called a <i>coinbase</i> is included with the processed payments. All bitcoins in existence have been created in such coinbase transactions. The <a href="/wiki/Bitcoin_protocol" class="mw-redirect" title="Bitcoin protocol">bitcoin protocol</a> specifies that the reward for adding a block will be halved every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years). Eventually, the reward will decrease to zero, and the limit of 21 million bitcoins will be reached <a href="/wiki/Circa" title="Circa">c.</a> 2140; the record keeping will then be rewarded by transaction fees solely.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Transaction_fees">Transaction fees</span></h3>
<p>Paying a transaction fee is optional. Miners can choose which transactions to process and prioritize those that pay higher fees. Fees are based on the storage size of the transaction generated, which in turn is dependent on the number of inputs used to create the transaction. Furthermore, priority is given to older unspent inputs.</p>

<p>A <i>wallet</i> stores the information necessary to transact bitcoins. While wallets are often described as a place to hold or store bitcoins, due to the nature of the system, bitcoins are inseparable from the blockchain transaction ledger. A better way to describe a wallet is something that &quot;stores the digital credentials for your bitcoin holdings&quot; and allows you to access (and spend) them. Bitcoin uses <a href="/wiki/Public-key_cryptography" title="Public-key cryptography">public-key cryptography</a>, in which two cryptographic keys, one public and one private, are generated. At its most basic, a wallet is a collection of these keys.</p>
<p>There are several types of wallets. <i>Software wallets</i> connect to the network and allow spending bitcoins in addition to holding the credentials that prove ownership. Software wallets can be split further in two categories: full clients and lightweight clients.</p>

<p>Besides software wallets, Internet services called <i>online wallets</i> offer similar functionality but may be easier to use. In this case, credentials to access funds are stored with the online wallet provider rather than on the user&apos;s hardware. As a result, the user must have complete trust in the wallet provider. A malicious provider or a breach in server security may cause entrusted bitcoins to be stolen. An example of such security breach occurred with <a href="/wiki/Mt_Gox" class="mw-redirect" title="Mt Gox">Mt Gox</a> in 2011.</p>
<p><i>Physical wallets</i> also exist and are more secure, as they store the credentials necessary to spend bitcoins offline. Examples combine a novelty coin with these credentials printed on metal, wood, or plastic. Others are simply paper printouts. Another type of wallet called a <i>hardware wallet</i> keeps credentials offline while facilitating transactions.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Reference_implementation">Reference implementation</span></h4>
<p>The first wallet program was released in 2009 by <a href="/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto" title="Satoshi Nakamoto">Satoshi Nakamoto</a> as <a href="/wiki/Open_source" class="mw-redirect" title="Open source">open-source</a> code and was originally called bitcoind. Sometimes referred to as the &quot;Satoshi client,&quot; this is also known as the <a href="/wiki/Reference_implementation" title="Reference implementation">reference client</a> because it serves to define the bitcoin protocol and acts as a standard for other implementations. In version 0.5 the client moved from the <a href="/wiki/WxWidgets" title="WxWidgets">wxWidgets</a> user interface toolkit to <a href="/wiki/Qt_(software)" title="Qt (software)">Qt</a>, and the whole bundle was referred to as Bitcoin-Qt. After the release of version 0.9, the software bundle was renamed <a href="/wiki/Bitcoin_Core" title="Bitcoin Core">Bitcoin Core</a> to distinguish itself from the network. Today, other <a href="/wiki/Fork_(software_development)" title="Fork (software development)">forks</a> of Bitcoin Core exist such as <a href="/wiki/Bitcoin_XT" title="Bitcoin XT">Bitcoin XT</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bitcoin_Classic" title="Bitcoin Classic">Bitcoin Classic</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Privacy">Privacy</span></h3>
<p>Bitcoin is a pseudonymous currency, meaning that funds are not tied to real-world entities but rather bitcoin addresses. Owners of bitcoin addresses are not explicitly identified, but all transactions on the blockchain are public. In addition, transactions can be linked to individuals and companies through &quot;idioms of use&quot; (e.g., transactions that spend coins from multiple inputs indicate that the inputs may have a common owner) and corroborating public transaction data with known information on owners of certain addresses. Additionally, bitcoin exchanges, where bitcoins are traded for traditional currencies, may be required by law to collect personal information.</p>
<p>To heighten financial privacy, a new bitcoin address can be generated for each transaction. For example, hierarchical deterministic wallets generate <a href="/wiki/Pseudorandom" class="mw-redirect" title="Pseudorandom">pseudorandom</a> &quot;rolling addresses&quot; for every transaction from a single <a href="/wiki/Random_seed" title="Random seed">seed</a>, while only requiring a single passphrase to be remembered to recover all corresponding private keys. Additionally, &quot;mixing&quot; and <a href="/wiki/CoinJoin" title="CoinJoin">CoinJoin</a> services aggregate multiple users&apos; coins and output them to fresh addresses to increase privacy. Researchers at <a href="/wiki/Stanford_University" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</a> and <a href="/wiki/Concordia_University" title="Concordia University">Concordia University</a> have also shown that bitcoin exchanges and other entities can prove assets, <a href="/wiki/Liability_(financial_accounting)" title="Liability (financial accounting)">liabilities</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Solvency" title="Solvency">solvency</a> without revealing their addresses using <a href="/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof" title="Zero-knowledge proof">zero-knowledge proofs</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, without additional privacy-preserving measures, it has been suggested that bitcoin payments should not be considered more private than credit card payments.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fungibility">Fungibility</span></h3>
<p>Wallets and similar software technically handle all bitcoins as equivalent, establishing the basic level of <a href="/wiki/Fungibility" title="Fungibility">fungibility</a>. Researchers have pointed out that the history of each bitcoin is registered and publicly available in the blockchain ledger, and that some users may refuse to accept bitcoins coming from controversial transactions, which would harm bitcoin&apos;s fungibility. Projects such as <a href="/wiki/Zerocoin" title="Zerocoin">Zerocoin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dark_Wallet" class="mw-redirect" title="Dark Wallet">Dark Wallet</a> aim to address these privacy and fungibility issues.</p>

<p>Bitcoin was invented by <a href="/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto" title="Satoshi Nakamoto">Satoshi Nakamoto</a>, who published the invention on 31 October 2008 in a research paper called &quot;Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System&quot;. It was implemented as <a href="/wiki/Open_source_code" class="mw-redirect" title="Open source code">open source code</a> and released in January 2009. Bitcoin is often called the first <a href="/wiki/Cryptocurrency" title="Cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a> although prior systems existed. Bitcoin is more correctly described as the first decentralized <a href="/wiki/Digital_currency" title="Digital currency">digital currency</a>.</p>
<p>One of the first supporters, adopters, contributor to bitcoin and receiver of the first bitcoin transaction was programmer <a href="/wiki/Hal_Finney_(cypherpunk)" class="mw-redirect" title="Hal Finney (cypherpunk)">Hal Finney</a>. Finney downloaded the bitcoin software the day it was released, and received 10 bitcoins from Nakamoto in the world&apos;s first bitcoin transaction.</p>
<p>Other early supporters were Wei Dai, creator of bitcoin predecessor <i>b-money</i>, and <a href="/wiki/Nick_Szabo" title="Nick Szabo">Nick Szabo</a>, creator of bitcoin predecessor <i>bit gold</i>.</p>
<p>In 2010, an <a href="/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security)" title="Exploit (computer security)">exploit</a> in an early bitcoin client was found that allowed large numbers of bitcoins to be created. The artificially created bitcoins were removed when another chain overtook the bad chain.</p>
<p>Based on bitcoin&apos;s open source code, other cryptocurrencies started to emerge in 2011.</p>
<p>In March 2013, a technical glitch caused a fork in the blockchain, with one half of the network adding blocks to one version of the chain and the other half adding to another. For six hours two bitcoin networks operated at the same time, each with its own version of the transaction history. The core developers called for a temporary halt to transactions, sparking a sharp sell-off. Normal operation was restored when the majority of the network downgraded to version 0.7 of the bitcoin software.</p>
<p>In 2013 some mainstream websites began accepting bitcoins. <a href="/wiki/WordPress" title="WordPress">WordPress</a> had started in November 2012, followed by <a href="/wiki/OKCupid" class="mw-redirect" title="OKCupid">OKCupid</a> in April 2013, <a href="/wiki/TigerDirect" title="TigerDirect">TigerDirect</a> and <a href="/wiki/Overstock.com" title="Overstock.com">Overstock.com</a> in January 2014, <a href="/wiki/Expedia" class="mw-redirect" title="Expedia">Expedia</a> in June 2014, <a href="/wiki/Newegg" title="Newegg">Newegg</a> and Dell in July 2014, and <a href="/wiki/Microsoft" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> in December 2014. The <a href="/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation" title="Electronic Frontier Foundation">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, a non-profit group, started accepting bitcoins in January 2011, stopped accepting them in June 2011, and began again in May 2013.</p>
<p>In May 2013, the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Homeland_Security" class="mw-redirect" title="Department of Homeland Security">Department of Homeland Security</a> seized assets belonging to the <a href="/wiki/Mt._Gox" title="Mt. Gox">Mt. Gox</a> exchange. The U.S. <a href="/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) shut down the <a href="/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)" title="Silk Road (marketplace)">Silk Road</a> website in October 2013.</p>
<p>In October 2013, Chinese internet giant <a href="/wiki/Baidu" title="Baidu">Baidu</a> had allowed clients of website security services to pay with bitcoins. During November 2013, the China-based bitcoin exchange <a href="/wiki/BTC_China" title="BTC China">BTC China</a> overtook the Japan-based Mt. Gox and the Europe-based <a href="/wiki/Bitstamp" title="Bitstamp">Bitstamp</a> to become the largest bitcoin trading exchange by trade volume. On 19 November 2013, the value of a bitcoin on the Mt. Gox exchange soared to a peak of US$900 after a United States Senate committee hearing was told by the FBI that virtual currencies are a legitimate financial service. On the same day, one bitcoin traded for over <a href="/wiki/Renminbi" title="Renminbi">RMB</a>&#xA5;6780 (US$1,100) in China. On 5 December 2013, the <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Bank_of_China" title="People&apos;s Bank of China">People&apos;s Bank of China</a> prohibited Chinese financial institutions from using bitcoins. After the announcement, the value of bitcoins dropped, and Baidu no longer accepted bitcoins for certain services. Buying real-world goods with any virtual currency has been illegal in China since at least 2009.</p>
<p>The first <a href="/wiki/Bitcoin_ATM" title="Bitcoin ATM">bitcoin ATM</a> was installed in October 2013 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.</p>
<p>With about 12 million existing bitcoins in November 2013, the new price increased the <a href="/wiki/Market_capitalization" title="Market capitalization">market cap</a> for bitcoin to at least US$7.2 billion. By 23 November 2013, the total market capitalization of bitcoin exceeded US$10 billion for the first time.</p>
<p>In the U.S., two men were arrested in January 2014 on charges of money-laundering using bitcoins; one was <a href="/wiki/Charlie_Shrem" title="Charlie Shrem">Charlie Shrem</a>, the head of now defunct bitcoin exchange <a href="/wiki/BitInstant" title="BitInstant">BitInstant</a> and a vice chairman of the <a href="/wiki/Bitcoin_Foundation" title="Bitcoin Foundation">Bitcoin Foundation</a>. Shrem allegedly allowed the other arrested party to purchase large quantities of bitcoins for use on black-market websites.</p>
<p>In early February 2014, one of the largest bitcoin exchanges, <a href="/wiki/Mt._Gox" title="Mt. Gox">Mt. Gox</a>, suspended withdrawals citing technical issues. By the end of the month, Mt. Gox had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan amid reports that 744,000 bitcoins had been stolen. Originally a site for trading <a href="/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering" title="Magic: The Gathering">Magic: The Gathering</a> cards, Mt. Gox had once been the dominant bitcoin exchange but its popularity had waned as users experienced difficulties withdrawing funds.</p>
<p>On 18 June 2014, it was announced that bitcoin <a href="/wiki/Payment_service_provider" title="Payment service provider">payment service provider</a> <a href="/wiki/BitPay" title="BitPay">BitPay</a> would become the new sponsor of <a href="/wiki/St._Petersburg_Bowl" title="St. Petersburg Bowl">St. Petersburg Bowl</a> under a two-year deal, renamed the Bitcoin St. Petersburg Bowl. Bitcoin was to be accepted for ticket and concession sales at the game as part of the sponsorship, and the sponsorship itself was also paid for using bitcoin.</p>
<p>Less than one year after the collapse of Mt. Gox, United Kingdom-based exhange <a href="/wiki/Bitstamp" title="Bitstamp">Bitstamp</a> announced that their exchange would be taken offline while they investigate a hack which resulted in about 19,000 bitcoins (equivalent to roughly US$5 million at that time) being stolen from their hot wallet. The exchange remained offline for several days amid speculation that customers had lost their funds. Bitstamp resumed trading on 9 January after increasing security measures and assuring customers that their account balances would not be impacted.</p>
<p>The bitcoin exchange service <a href="/wiki/Coinbase" title="Coinbase">Coinbase</a> launched the first regulated bitcoin exchange in 25 US states on 26 January 2015. At the time of the announcement, CEO Brian Armstrong stated that Coinbase intends to expand to thirty countries by the end of 2015. A spokesperson for <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_M._Lawsky" class="mw-redirect" title="Benjamin M. Lawsky">Benjamin M. Lawsky</a>, the superintendent of New York state&#x2019;s Department of Financial Services, stated that Coinbase is operating without a license in the state of New York. Lawsky is responsible for the development of the so-called &apos;<a href="/wiki/BitLicense" title="BitLicense">BitLicense</a>&apos;, which companies need to acquire in order to legally operate in New York.</p>
<p>In August 2015 it was announced that <a href="/wiki/Barclays" title="Barclays">Barclays</a> would become the first UK high street bank to start accepting bitcoin, with the bank revealing that it plans to allow users to make charitable donations using the currency.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Craig_Steven_Wright" title="Craig Steven Wright">Craig Steven Wright</a> has claimed to be the creator of bitcoin in a BBC news interview in 2016. He offered to prove this claim cryptographically several days later, without offering an explanation of the delay. The circumstantial proof he provided was picked apart by cryptography experts, with one describing it as &quot;flimflam and hokum&quot;.</p>

<p>According to the director of the Institute for Money, Technology and Financial Inclusion at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_California-Irvine" class="mw-redirect" title="University of California-Irvine">University of California-Irvine</a> there is &quot;an unsettled debate about whether bitcoin is a currency&quot;. Bitcoin is commonly referred to with terms like: digital currency, <a href="/wiki/Digital_cash" class="mw-redirect" title="Digital cash">digital cash</a>, <a href="/wiki/Virtual_currency" title="Virtual currency">virtual currency</a>, <a href="/wiki/Electronic_currency" class="mw-redirect" title="Electronic currency">electronic currency</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Cryptocurrency" title="Cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a>. Its inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, used the term electronic cash. Bitcoins have three useful qualities in a currency, according to the <i>Economist</i> in January 2015: they are &quot;hard to earn, limited in supply and easy to verify&quot;. Economists define money as a <a href="/wiki/Store_of_value" title="Store of value">store of value</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Medium_of_exchange" title="Medium of exchange">medium of exchange</a>, and a <a href="/wiki/Unit_of_account" title="Unit of account">unit of account</a> and agree that bitcoin has some way to go to meet all these criteria. It does best as a medium of exchange, as of February 2015 the number of merchants accepting bitcoin has passed 100,000. As of March 2014, the bitcoin market suffered from <a href="/wiki/Volatility_(finance)" title="Volatility (finance)">volatility</a>, limiting the ability of bitcoin to act as a stable store of value, and retailers accepting bitcoin use other currencies as their principal unit of account.</p>
<p>Journalists and academics also debate what to call bitcoin. Some media outlets do make a distinction between &quot;real&quot; money and bitcoins, while others call bitcoin real money. <i><a href="/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal" title="The Wall Street Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a></i> declared it a commodity in December 2013. A <i><a href="/wiki/Forbes" title="Forbes">Forbes</a></i> journalist referred to it as digital collectible. Two <a href="/wiki/University_of_Amsterdam" title="University of Amsterdam">University of Amsterdam</a> computer scientists proposed the term &quot;money-like informational commodity&quot;. <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Wired_(magazine)" title="Wired (magazine)">Wired</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Daily_Mail_Australia" class="mw-redirect" title="Daily Mail Australia">Daily Mail Australia</a></i>, <i>Forbes</i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Business_Wire" title="Business Wire">Business Wire</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Reuters" title="Reuters">Reuters</a></i> used the <a href="/wiki/Digital_asset" title="Digital asset">digital asset</a> classification for bitcoin.

<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Mark_T._Williams" title="Mark T. Williams">Mark T. Williams</a>, as of 2014, bitcoin has <a href="/wiki/Volatility_(finance)" title="Volatility (finance)">volatility</a> seven times greater than gold, eight times greater than the <a href="/wiki/S%26P_500" class="mw-redirect" title="S&amp;P 500">S&amp;P 500</a>, and eighteen times greater than the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>Attempting to explain the high volatility, a group of Japanese scholars stated that there is no stabilization mechanism. The Bitcoin Foundation contends that high volatility is due to insufficient <a href="/wiki/Liquidity" class="mw-redirect" title="Liquidity">liquidity</a>, while a <i>Forbes</i> journalist claims that it is related to the uncertainty of its long-term <a href="/wiki/Value_(economics)" title="Value (economics)">value</a>, and the high volatility of a startup currency makes sense, &quot;because people are still experimenting with the currency to figure out how useful it is.&quot;</p>
<p>There are uses where volatility does not matter, such as online gambling, tipping, and international remittances. As of 2014, pro-bitcoin venture capitalists argued that the greatly increased trading volume that planned <a href="/wiki/High-frequency_trading" title="High-frequency trading">high-frequency trading</a> exchanges would generate is needed to decrease price volatility.</p>
<p>The price of bitcoins has gone through various cycles of appreciation and depreciation referred to by some as <a href="/wiki/Economic_bubble" title="Economic bubble">bubbles</a> and busts. In 2011, the value of one bitcoin rapidly rose from about US$0.30 to US$32 before returning to US$2. In the latter half of 2012 and during the <a href="/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_Cypriot_financial_crisis" title="2012&#x2013;13 Cypriot financial crisis">2012&#x2013;13 Cypriot financial crisis</a>, the bitcoin price began to rise, reaching a high of US$266 on 10 April 2013, before crashing to around US$50. On 29 November 2013, the cost of one bitcoin rose to the all-time peak of US$1,242. In 2014, the price fell sharply, and as of April remained depressed at little more than half 2013 prices. As of August 2014 it was under US$600. In January 2015, noting that the bitcoin price had dropped to its lowest level since spring 2013 &#x2013; around US$224 &#x2013; <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> suggested that &quot;[w]ith no signs of a rally in the offing, the industry is bracing for the effects of a prolonged decline in prices. In particular, bitcoin mining companies, which are essential to the currency&#x2019;s underlying technology, are flashing warning signs.&quot; Also in January 2015, <i><a href="/wiki/Business_Insider" title="Business Insider">Business Insider</a></i> reported that <a href="/wiki/Dark_web" title="Dark web">deep web</a> drug dealers were &quot;freaking out&quot; as they lost profits through being unable to convert bitcoin revenue to cash quickly enough as the price declined &#x2013; and that there was a danger that dealers selling reserves to stay in business might force the bitcoin price down further.</p>
<p>On 4 November 2015, bitcoin had risen by more than 20%, exceeding $490. The <i><a href="/wiki/Financial_Times" title="Financial Times">Financial Times</a></i> associated the rapid growth with the popularity of &quot;socio-financial networks&quot; MMM operated by Russian businessman Sergei Mavrodi.</p>
<p>According to <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, as of April 2016, bitcoin is starting to look slightly more stable than gold.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Speculative_bubble_dispute">Speculative bubble dispute</span></h3>
<p>Bitcoin has been labelled a <i><a href="/wiki/Speculative_bubble" class="mw-redirect" title="Speculative bubble">speculative bubble</a></i> by many including former <a href="/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Chairman" class="mw-redirect" title="Federal Reserve Chairman">Fed Chairman</a> <a href="/wiki/Alan_Greenspan" title="Alan Greenspan">Alan Greenspan</a> and economist <a href="/wiki/John_Quiggin" title="John Quiggin">John Quiggin</a>. <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Memorial_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences" title="Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences">Nobel Memorial Prize</a> laureate <a href="/wiki/Robert_Shiller" class="mw-redirect" title="Robert Shiller">Robert Shiller</a> said that bitcoin &quot;exhibited many of the characteristics of a speculative bubble&quot;. Two lead software developers of bitcoin, <a href="/wiki/Gavin_Andresen" title="Gavin Andresen">Gavin Andresen</a> and Mike Hearn, have warned that bubbles may occur. David Andolfatto, a vice president at the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_St._Louis" title="Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis">Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis</a>, stated, &quot;Is bitcoin a bubble? Yes, if bubble is defined as a liquidity premium.&quot; According to Andolfatto, the price of bitcoin &quot;consists purely of a bubble,&quot; but he concedes that many assets have prices that are greater than their intrinsic value. Journalist Matthew Boesler rejects the speculative bubble label and sees bitcoin&apos;s quick rise in price as nothing more than normal economic forces at work. The <i>Washington Post</i> pointed out that the observed cycles of appreciation and depreciation don&apos;t correspond to the definition of speculative bubble.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ponzi_scheme_concerns">Ponzi scheme concerns</span></h3>
<p>Various journalists, economists, and bankers have voiced concerns that bitcoin is a <a href="/wiki/Ponzi_scheme" title="Ponzi scheme">Ponzi scheme</a>. <a href="/wiki/Eric_Posner" title="Eric Posner">Eric Posner</a>, a law professor at the University of Chicago, stated in 2013 that &quot;a real Ponzi scheme takes fraud; bitcoin, by contrast, seems more like a collective delusion.&quot; In 2014 reports by both the <a href="/wiki/World_Bank" title="World Bank">World Bank</a> and the Swiss <a href="/wiki/Federal_Council_(Switzerland)" class="mw-redirect" title="Federal Council (Switzerland)">Federal Council</a> examined the concerns and came to the conclusion that bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Value_forecasts">Value forecasts</span></h3>
<p>Financial journalists and analysts, economists, and investors have attempted to predict the possible future value of bitcoin. In April 2013, economist <a href="/wiki/John_Quiggin" title="John Quiggin">John Quiggin</a> stated, &quot;bitcoins will attain their true value of zero sooner or later, but it is impossible to say when&quot;. A similar forecast was made in November 2014 by economist <a href="/wiki/Kevin_Dowd" title="Kevin Dowd">Kevin Dowd</a>. In November 2014, David Yermack, Professor of Finance at New York University Stern School of Business, forecast that in November 2015 bitcoin may be all but worthless. In the indicated period bitcoin has exchanged as low as $176.50 (January 2015) and during November 2015 the bitcoin low was $309.90. In December 2013, finance professor <a href="/wiki/Mark_T._Williams" title="Mark T. Williams">Mark T. Williams</a> forecast a bitcoin would be worth less than $10 by July 2014. In the indicated period bitcoin has exchanged as low as $344 (April 2014) and during July 2014 the bitcoin low was $609. In December 2014, Williams said, &quot;The probability of success is low, but if it does hit, the reward will be very large.&quot; In May 2013, <a href="/wiki/Bank_of_America" title="Bank of America">Bank of America</a> FX and Rate Strategist David Woo forecast a maximum fair value per bitcoin of $1,300. Bitcoin investor <a href="/wiki/Cameron_Winklevoss" title="Cameron Winklevoss">Cameron Winklevoss</a> stated in December 2013 that the &quot;small bull case scenario for bitcoin is... 40,000 USD a coin&quot;.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Obituaries">Obituaries</span></h3>
<p>The &quot;death&quot; of bitcoin has been proclaimed numerous times. One journalist has recorded 29 such &quot;obituaries&quot; as of early 2015. <i><a href="/wiki/Forbes" title="Forbes">Forbes</a></i> magazine declared bitcoin &quot;dead&quot; in June 2011, followed by <i>Gizmodo Australia</i> in August 2011. <a href="/wiki/Wired_(magazine)" title="Wired (magazine)"><i>Wired</i></a> magazine wrote it had &quot;expired&quot; in December 2012. <i>Ouishare Magazine</i> declared, &quot;game over, bitcoin&quot; in May 2013, and <i>New York Magazine</i> stated bitcoin was &quot;on its path to grave&quot; in June 2013. <i>Reuters</i> published an &quot;obituary&quot; for bitcoin in January 2014. <i>Street Insider</i> declared bitcoin &quot;dead&quot; in February 2014, followed by <i>The Weekly Standard</i> in March 2014, <i>Salon</i> in March 2014, <i>Vice News</i> in March 2014, and <i>Financial Times</i> in September 2014. In January 2015, <i>USA Today</i> states bitcoin was &quot;headed to the ash heap&quot;, and <i>The Telegraph</i> declared &quot;the end of bitcoin experiment&quot;. In January 2016, former bitcoin developer Mike Hearn called bitcoin a &quot;failed project&quot;. Peter Greenhill, Director of E-Business Development for the Isle of Man, commenting on the obituaries paraphrased <a href="/wiki/Mark_Twain" title="Mark Twain">Mark Twain</a> saying &quot;reports of bitcoin&apos;s death have been greatly exaggerated&quot;.</p>

<p>David Andolfatto, Vice President at the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_St._Louis" title="Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis">Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis</a>, stated that bitcoin is a threat to the establishment, which he argues is a good thing for the Federal Reserve System and other central banks because it prompts these institutions to operate sound policies.</p>

<p>Due to the design of bitcoin, all retail figures are only estimates. According to Tim Swanson, head of business development at a Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency technology company, in 2014, daily retail purchases made with bitcoin were worth about $2.3 million. He estimates that, as of February 2015, fewer than 5,000 bitcoins per day (worth roughly $1.2 million at the time) were being used for retail transactions, and concluded that in 2014 &quot;it appears there has been very little if any increase in retail purchases using bitcoin.&quot;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Financial_institutions">Financial institutions</span></h3>
<p>Bitcoin companies have had difficulty opening traditional bank accounts because lenders have been leery of bitcoin&apos;s links to illicit activity. According to <a href="/wiki/Tony_Gallippi" title="Tony Gallippi">Antonio Gallippi</a>, a co-founder of <a href="/wiki/BitPay" title="BitPay">BitPay</a>, &quot;banks are scared to deal with bitcoin companies, even if they really want to&quot;. In 2014, the <a href="/wiki/National_Australia_Bank" title="National Australia Bank">National Australia Bank</a> closed accounts of businesses with ties to bitcoin, and <a href="/wiki/HSBC" title="HSBC">HSBC</a> refused to serve a hedge fund with links to bitcoin. Australian banks in general have been reported as closing down bank accounts of operators of businesses involving the currency; this has become the subject of an investigation by the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Competition_and_Consumer_Commission" title="Australian Competition and Consumer Commission">Australian Competition and Consumer Commission</a>. Nonetheless, Australian banks have keenly adopted the blockchain technology on which bitcoin is based.</p>
<p>In a 2013 report, Bank of America Merrill Lynch stated that &quot;we believe bitcoin can become a major means of payment for e-commerce and may emerge as a serious competitor to traditional money-transfer providers.&quot;</p>
<p>In June 2014, the first bank that converts deposits in currencies instantly to bitcoin without any fees was opened in Boston.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="As_an_investment">As an investment</span></h3>
<p>Some Argentinians have bought bitcoins to protect their savings against high inflation or the possibility that governments could confiscate savings accounts. During the <a href="/wiki/2012%E2%80%932013_Cypriot_financial_crisis" class="mw-redirect" title="2012&#x2013;2013 Cypriot financial crisis">2012&#x2013;2013 Cypriot financial crisis</a>, bitcoin purchases in Cyprus rose due to fears that savings accounts would be confiscated or taxed. Other methods of investment are bitcoin funds. The first regulated bitcoin fund was established in Jersey in July 2014 and approved by the Jersey Financial Services Commission. Also, c. 2012 an attempt was made by the <a href="/wiki/Winklevoss_twins" title="Winklevoss twins">Winklevoss twins</a> (who in April 2013 claimed they owned nearly 1% of all bitcoins in existence) to establish a bitcoin <a href="/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund" title="Exchange-traded fund">ETF</a>. As of early 2015, they have announced plans to launch a New York-based bitcoin exchange named Gemini, which has received approval to launch on 5 October 2015. On 4 May 2015, Bitcoin Investment Trust started trading on the OTCQX market as GBTC. Forbes started publishing arguments in favor of investing in December 2015.</p>
<p>In 2013 and 2014, the <a href="/wiki/European_Banking_Authority" title="European Banking Authority">European Banking Authority</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Financial_Industry_Regulatory_Authority" title="Financial Industry Regulatory Authority">Financial Industry Regulatory Authority</a> (FINRA), a United States <a href="/wiki/Self-regulatory_organization" title="Self-regulatory organization">self-regulatory organization</a>, warned that investing in bitcoins carries significant risks. Forbes named bitcoin the best investment of 2013. In 2014, Bloomberg named bitcoin one of its worst investments of the year. In 2015, bitcoin topped Bloomberg&apos;s currency tables.</p>
<p>To improve access to price information and increase transparency, on 30 April 2014 <a href="/wiki/Bloomberg_LP" class="mw-redirect" title="Bloomberg LP">Bloomberg LP</a> announced plans to list prices from bitcoin companies <a href="/wiki/Kraken_Bitcoin_Exchange" title="Kraken Bitcoin Exchange">Kraken</a> and <a href="/wiki/Coinbase" title="Coinbase">Coinbase</a> on its 320,000 subscription financial data terminals.

The company&apos;s goal is to fund 100 bitcoin businesses within 2&#x2013;3 years with $10,000 to $20,000 for a 6% stake. Investors also invest in bitcoin mining. According to a 2015 study by Paolo Tasca, bitcoin startups raised almost $1 billion in three years (Q1 2012 &#x2013; Q1 2015).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Political_economy">Political economy</span></h3>
<p>The decentralization of money offered by virtual currencies like bitcoin has its theoretical roots in the <a href="/wiki/Austrian_school_of_economics" class="mw-redirect" title="Austrian school of economics">Austrian school of economics</a>, especially with <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_von_Hayek" class="mw-redirect" title="Friedrich von Hayek">Friedrich von Hayek</a> in his book <i>Denationalisation of Money: The Argument Refined</i>, in which he advocates a complete <a href="/wiki/Free_market" title="Free market">free market</a> in the production, distribution and management of money to end the monopoly of <a href="/wiki/Central_banks" class="mw-redirect" title="Central banks">central banks</a>.</p>
<p>Bitcoin appeals to tech-savvy <a href="/wiki/Libertarian" class="mw-redirect" title="Libertarian">libertarians</a>, because it so far exists outside the institutional banking system and the control of governments. However, researchers looking to uncover the reasons for interest in bitcoin did not find evidence in Google search data that this was linked to libertarianism.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&apos;s appeal reaches from <a href="/wiki/Left_wing_politics" class="mw-redirect" title="Left wing politics">left wing</a> critics, &quot;who perceive the state and banking sector as representing the same elite interests, [&#x2026;] recognising in it the potential for collective <a href="/wiki/Direct_democratic" class="mw-redirect" title="Direct democratic">direct democratic</a> governance of currency&quot; and socialists proposing their &quot;own states, complete with currencies&quot;, to <a href="/wiki/Right_wing_politics" class="mw-redirect" title="Right wing politics">right wing</a> critics suspicious of <a href="/wiki/Big_government" title="Big government">big government</a>, at a time when activities within the regulated banking system were responsible for the severity of the <a href="/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308" title="Financial crisis of 2007&#x2013;08">financial crisis of 2007&#x2013;08</a>, &quot;because governments are not fully living up to the responsibility that comes with state-sponsored money&quot;. Bitcoin has been described as &quot;remov[ing] the imbalance between the big boys of finance and the disenfranchised little man, potentially allowing early adopters to negotiate favourable rates on exchanges and transfers &#x2013; something that only the very biggest firms have traditionally enjoyed&quot;. Two WSJ journalists describe bitcoin in their book as &quot;about freeing people from the tyranny of centralised trust&quot;.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Legal_status_and_regulation">Legal status and regulation</span></h2>

<p>The legal status of bitcoin varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them. While some countries have explicitly allowed its use and trade, others have banned or restricted it. Likewise, various government agencies, departments, and courts have classified bitcoins differently. Regulations and bans that apply to bitcoin probably extend to similar <a href="/wiki/Cryptocurrency" title="Cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a> systems.</p>
<p>In April 2013, <a href="/wiki/Steven_Strauss" title="Steven Strauss">Steven Strauss</a>, a Harvard public policy professor, suggested that governments could outlaw bitcoin, and this possibility was mentioned again by a bitcoin investment vehicle in a July 2013 report to a regulator. However, the vast majority of nations have not done so as of 2014. It is illegal in Bangladesh, Bolivia, Ecuador and Russia.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Criminal_activity">Criminal activity</span></h2>
<p>The use of bitcoin by criminals has attracted the attention of financial regulators, legislative bodies, law enforcement, and the media. The FBI prepared an intelligence assessment, the SEC has issued a pointed warning about investment schemes using virtual currencies, and the U.S. Senate held a hearing on virtual currencies in November 2013. <a href="/wiki/CNN" title="CNN">CNN</a> has referred to bitcoin as a &quot;shady online currency [that is] starting to gain legitimacy in certain parts of the world&quot;, and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Washington_Post" title="The Washington Post">The Washington Post</a></i> called it &quot;the currency of choice for seedy online activities&quot;.</p>
<p>Several news outlets have asserted that the popularity of bitcoins hinges on the ability to use them to purchase illegal goods. In 2014, researchers at the University of Kentucky found &quot;robust evidence that computer programming enthusiasts and illegal activity drive interest in bitcoin, and find limited or no support for political and investment motives.&quot;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Theft">Theft</span></h3>
<p>There have been many cases of bitcoin theft. One way this is accomplished involves a third party accessing the private key to a victim&apos;s bitcoin address, or of an online wallet. If the private key is stolen, all the bitcoins from the compromised address can be transferred. In that case, the network does not have any provisions to identify the thief, block further transactions of those stolen bitcoins, or return them to the legitimate owner.</p>
<p>Theft also occurs at sites where bitcoins are used to purchase illicit goods. In late November 2013, an estimated $100 million in bitcoins were allegedly stolen from the online illicit goods marketplace <a href="/wiki/Sheep_Marketplace" title="Sheep Marketplace">Sheep Marketplace</a>, which immediately closed. Users tracked the coins as they were processed and converted to cash, but no funds were recovered and no culprits identified. A different black market, Silk Road 2, stated that during a February 2014 hack, bitcoins valued at $2.7 million were taken from escrow accounts.</p>
<p>Sites where users exchange bitcoins for cash or store them in &quot;wallets&quot; are also targets for theft. Inputs.io, an Australian wallet service, was hacked twice in October 2013 and lost more than $1 million in bitcoins. In late February 2014 <a href="/wiki/Mt._Gox" title="Mt. Gox">Mt. Gox</a>, one of the largest virtual currency exchanges, filed for bankruptcy in Tokyo amid reports that bitcoins worth $350 million had been stolen. Flexcoin, a bitcoin storage specialist based in <a href="/wiki/Alberta,_Canada" class="mw-redirect" title="Alberta, Canada">Alberta, Canada</a>, shut down on March 2014 after saying it discovered a theft of about $650,000 in bitcoins. Poloniex, a digital currency exchange, reported on March 2014 that it lost bitcoins valued at around $50,000. In January 2015 UK-based <a href="/wiki/Bitstamp" title="Bitstamp">bitstamp</a>, the third busiest bitcoin exchange globally, was hacked and $5 million in bitcoins were stolen. February 2015 saw a Chinese exchange named BTER lose bitcoins worth nearly $2 million to hackers.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Black_markets">Black markets</span></h3>

<p>A <a href="/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University" title="Carnegie Mellon University">CMU</a> researcher estimated that in 2012, 4.5% to 9% of all transactions on all exchanges in the world were for drug trades on a single <a href="/wiki/Dark_web" title="Dark web">deep web</a> drugs market, <a href="/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)" title="Silk Road (marketplace)">Silk Road</a>. Child pornography, murder-for-hire services, and weapons are also allegedly available on black market sites that sell in bitcoin. Due to the anonymous nature and the lack of central control on these markets, it is hard to know whether the services are real or just trying to take the bitcoins.</p>
<p>Several deep web black markets have been shut by authorities. In October 2013 Silk Road was shut down by U.S. law enforcement leading to a short-term decrease in the value of bitcoin. In 2015, the founder of the site was sentenced to life in prison. Alternative sites were soon available, and in early 2014 the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation" title="Australian Broadcasting Corporation">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a> reported that the closure of Silk Road had little impact on the number of Australians selling drugs online, which had actually increased. In early 2014, Dutch authorities closed Utopia, an online illegal goods market, and seized 900 bitcoins. In late 2014, a joint police operation saw European and American authorities seize bitcoins and close 400 deep web sites including the illicit goods market Silk Road 2.0. Law enforcement activity has resulted in several convictions. In December 2014, <a href="/wiki/Charlie_Shrem" title="Charlie Shrem">Charlie Shrem</a> was sentenced to two years in prison for indirectly helping to send $1 million to the Silk Road drugs site, and in February 2015, its founder, <a href="/wiki/Ross_Ulbricht" title="Ross Ulbricht">Ross Ulbricht</a>, was convicted on drugs charges and faces a life sentence.</p>
<p>Some black market sites may seek to steal bitcoins from customers. The bitcoin community branded one site, Sheep Marketplace, as a scam when it prevented withdrawals and shut down after an alleged bitcoins theft. In a separate case, escrow accounts with bitcoins belonging to patrons of a different black market were hacked in early 2014.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="/wiki/Internet_Watch_Foundation" title="Internet Watch Foundation">Internet Watch Foundation</a>, a UK-based charity, bitcoin is used to purchase child pornography, and almost 200 such websites accept it as payment. Bitcoin isn&apos;t the sole way to purchase child pornography online, as Troels Oertling, head of the cybercrime unit at <a href="/wiki/Europol" title="Europol">Europol</a>, states, &quot;Ukash and Paysafecard... have [also] been used to pay for such material.&quot; However, the Internet Watch Foundation lists around 30 sites that exclusively accept bitcoins. Some of these sites have shut down, such as a deep web <a href="/wiki/Crowdfunding" title="Crowdfunding">crowdfunding</a> website that aimed to fund the creation of new child porn. Furthermore, hyperlinks to child porn websites have been added to the blockchain as arbitrary data can be included when a transaction is made.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Money_laundering">Money laundering</span></h3>
<p>Bitcoins may not be ideal for money laundering because all transactions are public. Authorities, including the <a href="/wiki/European_Banking_Authority" title="European Banking Authority">European Banking Authority</a> the FBI, and the <a href="/wiki/Financial_Action_Task_Force" class="mw-redirect" title="Financial Action Task Force">Financial Action Task Force</a> of the <a href="/wiki/G7" class="mw-redirect" title="G7">G7</a> have expressed concerns that bitcoin may be used for money laundering. In early 2014, an operator of a U.S. bitcoin exchange was arrested for money laundering. A report by UK&apos;s <a href="/wiki/HM_Treasury" title="HM Treasury">Treasury</a> and <a href="/wiki/Home_Office" title="Home Office">Home Office</a> named &quot;UK national risk assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing&quot; (2015 October) found that, of the twelve methods examined in the report, bitcoin carries the lowest risk of being used for money laundering, with the most common money laundering method being the banks.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ponzi_scheme">Ponzi scheme</span></h3>
<p>In a <a href="/wiki/Ponzi_scheme" title="Ponzi scheme">Ponzi scheme</a> that utilized bitcoins, The Bitcoin Savings and Trust promised investors up to 7 percent weekly interest, and raised at least 700,000 bitcoins from 2011 to 2012. In July 2013 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged the company and its founder in 2013 &quot;with defrauding investors in a Ponzi scheme involving bitcoin&quot;. In September 2014 the judge fined Bitcoin Savings &amp; Trust and its owner $40 million for operating a bitcoin Ponzi scheme.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Malware">Malware</span></h3>
<p>Bitcoin-related <a href="/wiki/Malware" title="Malware">malware</a> includes software that steals bitcoins from users using a variety of techniques, software that uses infected computers to mine bitcoins, and different types of <a href="/wiki/Ransomware" title="Ransomware">ransomware</a>, which disable computers or prevent files from being accessed until some payment is made. Security company <a href="/wiki/SecureWorks" title="SecureWorks">Dell SecureWorks</a> said in February 2014 that it had identified almost 150 types of bitcoin malware.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Unauthorized_mining">Unauthorized mining</span></h4>
<p>In June 2011, <a href="/wiki/Symantec" title="Symantec">Symantec</a> warned about the possibility that <a href="/wiki/Botnet" title="Botnet">botnets</a> could mine covertly for bitcoins. Malware used the <a href="/wiki/Parallel_computing" title="Parallel computing">parallel processing</a> capabilities of <a href="/wiki/GPU" class="mw-redirect" title="GPU">GPUs</a> built into many modern <a href="/wiki/Video_card" title="Video card">video cards</a>. Although the average PC with an integrated graphics processor is virtually useless for bitcoin mining, tens of thousands of PCs laden with mining malware could produce some results.</p>
<p>In mid-August 2011, bitcoin mining botnets were detected, and less than three months later, bitcoin mining <a href="/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing)" title="Trojan horse (computing)">trojans</a> had infected <a href="/wiki/Mac_OS_X" class="mw-redirect" title="Mac OS X">Mac OS X</a>.</p>
<p>In April 2013, <a href="/wiki/Electronic_sports" class="mw-redirect" title="Electronic sports">electronic sports</a> organization E-Sports Entertainment was accused of hijacking 14,000 computers to mine bitcoins; the company later settled the case with the State of New Jersey.</p>
<p>German police arrested two people in December 2013 who customized existing botnet software to perform bitcoin mining, which police said had been used to mine at least $950,000 worth of bitcoins.</p>
<p>For four days in December 2013 and January 2014, <a href="/wiki/Yahoo!" title="Yahoo!">Yahoo!</a> Europe hosted an ad containing bitcoin mining malware that infected an estimated two million computers. The software, called <a href="/wiki/Mevade_Botnet" title="Mevade Botnet">Sefnit</a>, was first detected in mid-2013 and has been bundled with many software packages. Microsoft has been removing the malware through its <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Security_Essentials" title="Microsoft Security Essentials">Microsoft Security Essentials</a> and other security software.</p>
<p>Several reports of employees or students using university or research computers to mine bitcoins have been published.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Malware_stealing">Malware stealing</span></h4>
<p>Some malware can steal private keys for bitcoin wallets allowing the bitcoins themselves to be stolen. The most common type searches computers for cryptocurrency wallets to upload to a remote server where they can be cracked and their coins stolen. Many of these also <a href="/wiki/Keylogger" class="mw-redirect" title="Keylogger">log keystrokes</a> to record passwords, often avoiding the need to crack the keys. A different approach detects when a bitcoin address is copied to a <a href="/wiki/Clipboard_(computing)" title="Clipboard (computing)">clipboard</a> and quickly replaces it with a different address, tricking people into sending bitcoins to the wrong address. This method is effective because bitcoin transactions are irreversible.</p>
<p>One <a href="/wiki/Computer_virus" title="Computer virus">virus</a>, spread through the Pony <a href="/wiki/Botnet" title="Botnet">botnet</a>, was reported in February 2014 to have stolen up to $220,000 in cryptocurrencies including bitcoins from 85 wallets. Security company <a href="/wiki/Trustwave" class="mw-redirect" title="Trustwave">Trustwave</a>, which tracked the malware, reports that its latest version was able to steal 30 types of digital currency.</p>
<p>A type of Mac malware active in August 2013, Bitvanity posed as a vanity wallet address generator and stole addresses and private keys from other bitcoin client software. A different trojan for Mac OS X, called CoinThief was reported in February 2014 to be responsible for multiple bitcoin thefts. The software was hidden in versions of some cryptocurrency apps on <a href="/wiki/Download.com" title="Download.com">Download.com</a> and <a href="/wiki/MacUpdate" title="MacUpdate">MacUpdate</a>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Ransomware">Ransomware</span></h4>
<p>Another type of bitcoin-related malware is <a href="/wiki/Ransomware" title="Ransomware">ransomware</a>. One program called <a href="/wiki/CryptoLocker" title="CryptoLocker">CryptoLocker</a>, typically spread through legitimate-looking email attachments, encrypts the hard drive of an infected computer, then displays a countdown timer and demands a ransom, usually two bitcoins, to decrypt it. Massachusetts police said they paid a 2 bitcoin ransom in November 2013, worth more than $1,300 at the time, to decrypt one of their hard drives. Linkup, a combination ransomware and bitcoin mining program that surfaced in February 2014, disables internet access and demands credit card information to restore it, while secretly mining bitcoins.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Security">Security</span></h2>
<p>Various potential attacks on the <a href="/wiki/Bitcoin_network" title="Bitcoin network">bitcoin network</a> and its use as a payment system, real or theoretical, have been considered. The bitcoin protocol includes several features that protect it against some of those attacks, such as unauthorized spending, double spending, forging bitcoins, and tampering with the blockchain. Other attacks, such as theft of private keys, require due care by users.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Unauthorized_spending">Unauthorized spending</span></h3>
<p>Unauthorized spending is mitigated by bitcoin&apos;s implementation of public-private key cryptography. For example; when Alice sends a bitcoin to Bob, Bob becomes the new owner of the bitcoin. Eve observing the transaction might want to spend the bitcoin Bob just received, but she cannot sign the transaction without the knowledge of Bob&apos;s private key.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Double_spending">Double spending</span></h3>
<p>A specific problem that an internet payment system must solve is <a href="/wiki/Double-spending" title="Double-spending">double-spending</a>, whereby a user pays the same coin to two or more different recipients. An example of such a problem would be if Eve sent a bitcoin to Alice and later sent the same bitcoin to Bob. The bitcoin network guards against double-spending by recording all bitcoin transfers in a ledger (the blockchain) that is visible to all users, and ensuring for all transferred bitcoins that they haven&apos;t been previously spent.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Race_attack">Race attack</span></h3>
<p>If Eve offers to pay Alice a bitcoin in exchange for goods and signs a corresponding transaction, it is still possible that she also creates a different transaction at the same time sending the same bitcoin to Bob. By the rules, the network accepts only one of the transactions. This is called a <a href="/wiki/Race_condition" title="Race condition">race attack</a>, since there is a race which transaction will be accepted first. Alice can reduce the risk of race attack stipulating that she will not deliver the goods until Eve&apos;s payment to Alice appears in the blockchain.</p>
<p>A variant race attack (which has been called a Finney attack by reference to Hal Finney) requires the participation of a miner. Instead of sending both payment requests (to pay Bob and Alice with the same coins) to the network, Eve issues only Alice&apos;s payment request to the network, while the accomplice tries to mine a block that includes the payment to Bob instead of Alice. There is a positive probability that the rogue miner will succeed before the network, in which case the payment to Alice will be rejected. As with the plain race attack, Alice can reduce the risk of a Finney attack by waiting for the payment to be included in the blockchain.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="History_modification">History modification</span></h3>
<p>The other principal way to steal bitcoins would be to modify blockchain ledger entries.</p>
<p>For example, Eve could buy something from Alice, like a sofa, by adding a signed entry to the blockchain ledger equivalent to <i>Eve pays Alice 5 bitcoins</i>. Later, after receiving the sofa, Eve could modify that blockchain ledger entry to read instead: <i>Eve pays Alice 0.05 bitcoins</i>, or replace Alice&apos;s address by another of Eve&apos;s addresses. Digital signatures cannot prevent this attack: Eve can simply sign her entry again after modifying it.</p>
<p>To prevent modification attacks, each block of transactions that is added to the blockchain includes a <a href="/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function" title="Cryptographic hash function">cryptographic hash code</a> that is computed from the hash of the previous block as well as all the information in the block itself. When the bitcoin software notices two competing blockchains, it will automatically assume that the chain with the greatest amount of work to produce it is the valid one. Therefore, in order to modify an already recorded transaction (as in the above example), the attacker would have to recalculate not just the modified block, but all the blocks after the modified one, until the modified chain contains more work than the legitimate chain that the rest of the network has been building in the meantime. Consequently, for this attack to succeed, the attacker must outperform the honest part of the network.</p>
<p>Each block that is added to the blockchain, starting with the block containing a given transaction, is called a confirmation of that transaction. Ideally, merchants and services that receive payment in bitcoin should wait for at least one confirmation to be distributed over the network, before assuming that the payment was done. The more confirmations that the merchant waits for, the more difficult it is for an attacker to successfully reverse the transaction in a blockchain&#x2014;unless the attacker controls more than half the total network power, in which case it is called a 51% attack. For example, if the attacker possesses 10% of the calculation power of the bitcoin network and the shop requires 6 confirmations for a successful transaction, the probability of success of such an attack will be 0.02428%.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Selfish_mining">Selfish mining</span></h3>
<p>This attack was first introduced by Ittay Eyal and Emin Gun Sirer at the beginning of November 2013. In this attack, the attacker finds blocks but does not broadcast them. Instead, the attacker mines their own private chain and later (when another miner or network of miners finds their own block) publishes several private blocks in a row. This forces the &quot;honest&quot; network to abandon their previous work and switch to the attacker&apos;s branch. As a result, honest miners lose a significant part of their revenue, causing a relatively greater proportion of blocks in the blockchain to be of the attacker&apos;s work and thereby increasing the attacker&apos;s profits.</p>
<p>Gavin Andresen and Ed Felten disagreed with this conclusion, Felten defending his assertion that the bitcoin protocol is incentive compatible. The original authors responded that the disagreement stemmed from Felten&apos;s misunderstanding of how miners are compensated in mining pools, that the assertion was in error, given the presence of a strategy that dominates honest mining, and that the error stemmed from Felten et al. not modeling block withholding attacks in their analysis.</p>

<p>Along with transaction graph analysis, which may reveal connections between bitcoin addresses (pseudonyms), there is a possible attack which links a user&apos;s pseudonym to its <a href="/wiki/IP_address" title="IP address">IP address</a>. If the peer is using <a href="/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)" title="Tor (anonymity network)">Tor</a>, the attack includes a method to separate the peer from the Tor network, forcing them to use their real IP address for any further transactions. The attack makes use of bitcoin mechanisms of relaying peer addresses and anti-<a href="/wiki/DoS" class="mw-redirect" title="DoS">DoS</a> protection. The cost of the attack on the full bitcoin network is under &#x20AC;1500 per month.</p>
