<p>The band K3 started by Niels William. Initially their goal was to be the Flemish version of the Spice Girls, and they had females in their twenties as their target audience, which is noticeable in their early song lyrics. Their first single, &quot;Wat ik wil&quot; (What I want), was not very successful.</p>
<p>In 1999 K3 participated in the live television shows to select the Belgian entry for the <a href="/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest" title="Eurovision Song Contest">Eurovision Song Contest</a>, with their song &quot;Heyah Mama&quot;. The song was not well received by one of the judges, Marcel Vanthilt, who referred to the band members as assorted meat products. Notwithstanding, &quot;Heyah Mama&quot; was released as a single and became the first big hit for the band, staying at the number one spot of the Flemish Ultratop 50 chart for 25 weeks. Their next two singles also reached the number one position, resulting in an uninterrupted period of 32 weeks in which a K3 song was at the top of that chart. About a year after becoming famous in <a href="/wiki/Flanders" title="Flanders">Flanders</a>, K3 also became famous in the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>.</p>
<p>Their songs are written by Miguel Wiels, Alain Vande Putte and Peter Gillis. This trio previously collaborated as songwriters for Flemish singer Isabelle A.</p>

Niels William&apos;s new marketing concept was based on promotion via children and cartoon channels like <a href="/wiki/Jetix" title="Jetix">Fox Kids</a>.</p>
