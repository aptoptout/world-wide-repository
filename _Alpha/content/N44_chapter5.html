The dynamic nature of the discipline of military history is largely related to the rapidity of change the military forces, and the art and science of managing them, as well as the frenetic pace of <a href="/wiki/Technological_evolution" title="Technological evolution">technological development</a> that had taken place during the period known as the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, and more recently in the <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation" title="Nuclear proliferation">nuclear</a> and <a href="/wiki/Information_age" class="mw-redirect" title="Information age">information ages</a>. An important recent concept is the <a href="/wiki/Revolution_in_Military_Affairs" title="Revolution in Military Affairs">Revolution in Military Affairs</a> (RMA) which attempts to explain how warfare has been shaped by emerging technologies, such as gunpowder. It highlights the short outbursts of rapid change followed by periods of relative stability.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In terms of the history profession in major countries, military history is an orphan, despite its enormous popularity with the general public. <a href="/wiki/William_H._McNeill_(historian)" title="William H.

In this case, military history with an eye to gaining an accurate assessment of conflicts using all available sources. For this reason military history is periodised, creating overlaying boundaries of study and analysis in which descriptions of battles by leaders may be unreliable due to the inclination to minimize mention of failure and exaggerate success. Military historians use Historiographical analysis in an effort to allow an unbiased, contemporary view of records.</p><p>One military historian, Jeremy Black, in a recent work mentioned some problems 21st century military historians face as an inheritance of their predecessors: Eurocentricity, a technological bias, a focus on leading military powers and dominant military systems, the separation of land from sea and recently air conflicts, the focus on state-to-state conflict, a lack of focus on political &quot;tasking&quot; in how forces are used.</p><p>If these challenges were not sufficient for the military historians, the limits of method are complicated by the lack of records, either destroyed or never recorded for its value as a <a href="/wiki/Military_secret" class="mw-redirect" title="Military secret">military secret</a> that may prevent some salient facts from being reported at all; scholars still do not know the exact nature of <a href="/wiki/Greek_fire" title="Greek fire">Greek fire</a> for instance. Researching Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, for example, have presented unique challenges to historians due to records that were destroyed to protect classified miltiary information, among other reasons. Historians utilize their knowledge of government regulation and military organization, and employing a targeted and systematic research strategy to piece together war histories. Despite these limits, wars are some of the most studied and detailed periods of human history.</p><p>Military historians have often <a href="/wiki/Comparative_history" title="Comparative history">compared</a> organization, tactical and strategic ideas, leadership, and national support of the militaries of different nations.</p><p>The documentation of military history begins with the confrontation between Sumer (current <a href="/wiki/Iraq" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>) and Elam (current <a href="/wiki/Iran" title="Iran">Iran</a>) c. 2700 BC near the modern <a href="/wiki/Basra" title="Basra">Basra</a>, and includes such enduring records as the <a href="/wiki/Hebrew_Bible" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>.

They were primitive forts surrounded by ditches filled with water. Forts were then built out of mud bricks, stones, wood, and other available materials. Romans used rectangular fortresses built out of wood and stone.

The <a href="/wiki/Crossbow" title="Crossbow">crossbow</a> was developed around 500 BC in China, and was used a lot in the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>. The English/Welsh <a href="/wiki/Longbow" title="Longbow">longbow</a> from the 12th century also became important in the Middle Ages.

Until the mid-15th century, guns were held in one hand, while the <a href="/wiki/Explosive_charge" class="mw-redirect" title="Explosive charge">explosive charge</a> was ignited by the other hand. Then came the <a href="/wiki/Matchlock" title="Matchlock">matchlock</a>, which was used widely until around the 1720s. <a href="/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci" title="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> made drawings of the <a href="/wiki/Wheel_lock" class="mw-redirect" title="Wheel lock">wheel lock</a> which made its own sparks. Eventually, the matchlock was replaced by the <a href="/wiki/Flintlock" title="Flintlock">flintlock</a>. <a href="/wiki/Cannon" title="Cannon">Cannons</a> were first used in Europe in the early 14th century, and played a vital role in the <a href="/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War" title="Hundred Years&apos; War">Hundred Years&apos; War</a>. The first cannons were simply welded metal bars in the form of a cylinder, and the first cannonballs were made of stone. By 1346, at the Battle of Cr&#xE9;cy, the cannon had been used; at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Agincourt" title="Battle of Agincourt">Battle of Agincourt</a> they would be used again.</p><p>At the beginning of the 16th century, the first European <a href="/wiki/Fire_ship" title="Fire ship">fire ships</a> were used.

The French were the first to introduce the <a href="/wiki/Armored_car_(military)" title="Armored car (military)">armored car</a> in 1902. Then in 1918, the British produced the first <a href="/wiki/Armoured_personnel_carrier" title="Armoured personnel carrier">armored troop carrier</a>. Many early <a href="/wiki/Tank" title="Tank">tanks</a> were proof of concept but impractical until further development. In World War I, the British and French held a crucial advantage due to their superiority in tanks; the Germans had only a few dozen A<sub>7</sub>V tanks, as well as 170 captured tanks. The British and French both had several hundred each. The French tanks included the 13 ton <a href="/wiki/Schneider-Creusot" title="Schneider-Creusot">Schneider-Creusot</a>, with a 75&#xA0;mm gun, and the British had the <a href="/wiki/Mark_I_tank#Mark_IV" class="mw-redirect" title="Mark I tank">Mark IV</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mark_I_tank#Mark_V_series" class="mw-redirect" title="Mark I tank">Mark V</a> tanks.</p><p>On December 17, 1903, the <a href="/wiki/Wright_Brothers" class="mw-redirect" title="Wright Brothers">Wright Brothers</a> performed the first controlled, powered, heavier-than-air flight; it went 39 meters (120&#xA0;ft).

In 1911 an aircraft took off from a warship for the first time. Landings on a cruiser were another matter. This led to the development of an <a href="/wiki/Aircraft_carrier" title="Aircraft carrier">aircraft carrier</a> with a decent unobstructed flight deck.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Chemical_warfare" title="Chemical warfare">Chemical warfare</a> exploded into the public consciousness in World War I but may have been used in earlier wars without as much human attention. The Germans used gas-filled shells at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Bolimov" class="mw-redirect" title="Battle of Bolimov">Battle of Bolimov</a> on January 3, 1915. These were not lethal, however. In April 1915, the Germans developed a chlorine gas that was highly lethal, and used it to moderate effect at the <a href="/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Ypres" title="Second Battle of Ypres">Second Battle of Ypres</a>. Gas masks were invented in matter of weeks, and poison gas proved ineffective at winning battles. It was made illegal by all nations in the 1920s.</p><p>World War II gave rise to even more technology.

While general discipline of history subdivides history into Ancient history (Classical antiquity), Middle Ages (Europe, 4th century &#x2013; 15th century), Early Modern period (Europe, 14th century &#x2013; 18th century), Modern era (Europe, 18th century &#x2013; 20th century), and the Post-Modern (USA, 1949&#x2013;present), the periodisation below stresses technological change in its emphasis, particularly the crucial dramatic change during the Gunpowder warfare period.</p><p>Periodisation is not uniformly applied through time and space, affirming the claims of Eurocentrism from regional historians. For example, what might be described as <a href="/wiki/Prehistoric_warfare" title="Prehistoric warfare">prehistoric warfare</a> is still practised in a few parts of the world. Other eras that are distinct in European history, such as the era of <a href="/wiki/Medieval_warfare" title="Medieval warfare">medieval warfare</a>, may have little relevance in East Asia.</p><p>Much of what we know of <a href="/wiki/Ancient_history" title="Ancient history">ancient history</a> is the history of militaries: their conquests, their movements, and their technological innovations. There are many reasons for this. Kingdoms and empires, the central units of control in the ancient world, could only be maintained through military force. Due to limited agricultural ability, there were relatively few areas that could support large communities, so fighting was common.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Weapon" title="Weapon">Weapons</a> and <a href="/wiki/Armor" class="mw-redirect" title="Armor">armor</a>, designed to be sturdy, tended to last longer than other artifacts, and thus a great deal of surviving artifacts recovered tend to fall in this category as they are more likely to survive. Weapons and armor were also mass-produced to a scale that makes them quite plentiful throughout history, and thus more likely to be found in archaeological digs.</p><p>Such items were also considered signs of prosperity or virtue, and thus were likely to be placed in tombs and monuments to prominent warriors. And writing, when it existed, was often used for kings to boast of military conquests or victories.</p><p>Writing, when used by the common man, also tended to record such events, as major battles and conquests constituted major events that many would have considered worthy of recording either in an epic such as the <a href="/wiki/Homeric" class="mw-redirect" title="Homeric">Homeric</a> writings pertaining to the Trojan War, or even personal writings. Indeed, the earliest stories center on warfare, as war was both a common and dramatic aspect of life; the witnessing of a major battle involving many thousands of soldiers would be quite a spectacle, even today, and thus considered worthy both of being recorded in song and art, but also in realistic histories, as well as being a central element in a fictional work.</p><p>Lastly, as <a href="/wiki/Nation_states" class="mw-redirect" title="Nation states">nation states</a> evolved and empires grew, the increased need for order and efficiency lead to an increase in the number of records and writings. Officials and armies would have good reason for keeping detailed records and accounts involving any and all things concerning a matter such as warfare that in the words of <a href="/wiki/Sun_Tzu" title="Sun Tzu">Sun Tzu</a> was &quot;a matter of vital importance to the state&quot;.
