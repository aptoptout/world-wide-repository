<p>A <b>cyborg</b> (short for &quot;<a href="/wiki/Cybernetics" title="Cybernetics"><b>cyb</b>ernetic</a> <a href="/wiki/Organism" title="Organism"><b>org</b>anism</a>&quot;) is a being with both organic and <a href="/wiki/Biomechatronic" class="mw-redirect" title="Biomechatronic">biomechatronic</a> body parts.

<p>D. S. Halacy&apos;s <i>Cyborg: Evolution of the Superman</i> in 1965 featured an introduction which spoke of a &quot;new frontier&quot; that was &quot;not merely space, but more profoundly the relationship between &apos;inner space&apos; to &apos;outer space&apos; &#x2013; a bridge...between mind and matter.&quot; In popular culture, some cyborgs may be represented as visibly mechanical (e.g., the <a href="/wiki/Cybermen" class="mw-redirect" title="Cybermen">Cybermen</a> in the <i><a href="/wiki/Doctor_Who" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i> franchise or <a href="/wiki/Borg_(Star_Trek)" title="Borg (Star Trek)">The Borg</a> from <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Trek" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a></i> or <a href="/wiki/Darth_Vader" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a> from <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i>); as almost indistinguishable from humans (e.g., the <a href="/wiki/Cylon_(re-imagining)" class="mw-redirect" title="Cylon (re-imagining)">&quot;Human&quot; Cylons</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(re-imagining)" class="mw-redirect" title="Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)">re-imagining of <i>Battlestar Galactica</i></a> etc.) The 1970s television series <i><a href="/wiki/The_Six_Million_Dollar_Man" title="The Six Million Dollar Man">The Six Million Dollar Man</a></i> featured one of the most famous fictional cyborgs, referred to as a <a href="/wiki/Bionics" title="Bionics">bionic</a> man; the series was based upon a novel by <a href="/wiki/Martin_Caidin" title="Martin Caidin">Martin Caidin</a> titled <i><a href="/wiki/Cyborg_(novel)" title="Cyborg (novel)">Cyborg</a></i>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Overview">Overview</span></h2>
<p>According to some definitions of the term, the physical attachments <a href="/wiki/Human_race" class="mw-redirect" title="Human race">humanity</a> has with even the most basic technologies have already made them cyborgs. In a typical example, a human with an <a href="/wiki/Artificial_pacemaker" class="mw-redirect" title="Artificial pacemaker">artificial cardiac pacemaker</a> or <a href="/wiki/Implantable_cardioverter-defibrillator" title="Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator">implantable cardioverter-defibrillator</a> would be considered a cyborg, since these devices measure voltage potentials in the body, perform signal processing, and can deliver electrical stimuli, using this synthetic <a href="/wiki/Feedback" title="Feedback">feedback</a> mechanism to keep that person alive. Implants, especially <a href="/wiki/Cochlear_implant" title="Cochlear implant">cochlear implants</a>, that combine mechanical modification with any kind of feedback response are also cyborg enhancements. Some theorists cite such modifications as <a href="/wiki/Contact_lens" title="Contact lens">contact lenses</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hearing_aid" title="Hearing aid">hearing aids</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Intraocular_lens" title="Intraocular lens">intraocular lenses</a> as examples of fitting humans with technology to enhance their biological capabilities. As cyborgs currently are on the rise some theorists argue there is a need to develop new definitions of aging and for instance a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaging.2014.09.003">bio-techno-social definition of aging</a> has been suggested.</p>
<p>The term is also used to address human-<a href="/wiki/Technology" title="Technology">technology</a> mixtures in the abstract. This includes not only commonly used pieces of technology such as phones, computers, the Internet, etc. but also artifacts that may not popularly be considered technology; for example, pen and paper, and <a href="/wiki/Speech_communication" class="mw-redirect" title="Speech communication">speech</a> and <a href="/wiki/Language" title="Language">language</a>. When augmented with these technologies and connected in communication with people in other times and places, a person becomes capable of much more than they were before. This is like a computer, which gains power by using Internet protocols to connect with other computers. Cybernetic technologies include highways, pipes, electrical wiring, buildings, electrical plants, libraries, and other infrastructure that we hardly notice, but which are critical parts of the <a href="/wiki/Cybernetics" title="Cybernetics">cybernetics</a> that we work within.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Bruce_Sterling" title="Bruce Sterling">Bruce Sterling</a> in his universe of <a href="/wiki/Shaper/Mechanist" class="mw-redirect" title="Shaper/Mechanist">Shaper/Mechanist</a> suggested an idea of alternative cyborg called <a href="/w/index.php?title=Lobster_(cyborg)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Lobster (cyborg) (page does not exist)">Lobster</a>, which is made not by using internal implants, but by using an external shell (<i>e.g.</i> a <a href="/wiki/Artificial_powered_exoskeleton" class="mw-redirect" title="Artificial powered exoskeleton">Powered Exoskeleton</a>). Unlike human cyborgs that appear human externally while being synthetic internally (<i>e.g.</i> the Bishop type in the <a href="/wiki/Alien_(franchise)" title="Alien (franchise)">Alien</a> franchise), Lobster looks inhuman externally but contains a human internally (<i>e.g.</i> <a href="/wiki/Elysium_(film)" title="Elysium (film)">Elysium</a>, <a href="/wiki/RoboCop" title="RoboCop">RoboCop</a>). The computer game <i><a href="/wiki/Deus_Ex:_Invisible_War" title="Deus Ex: Invisible War">Deus Ex: Invisible War</a></i> prominently featured cyborgs called <a href="/wiki/Omar_(Deus_Ex)" class="mw-redirect" title="Omar (Deus Ex)">Omar</a>, where &quot;Omar&quot; is a Russian translation of the word &quot;Lobster&quot; (since the Omar are of Russian origin in the game).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Origins">Origins</span></h2>
<p>The concept of a man-machine mixture was widespread in <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> before World War II. As early as 1843, <a href="/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe" title="Edgar Allan Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> described a man with extensive prostheses in the short story &quot;<a href="/wiki/The_Man_That_Was_Used_Up" title="The Man That Was Used Up">The Man That Was Used Up</a>&quot;. In 1911, <a href="/wiki/Jean_de_la_Hire" class="mw-redirect" title="Jean de la Hire">Jean de la Hire</a> introduced the <a href="/wiki/Nyctalope" title="Nyctalope">Nyctalope</a>, a science fiction hero who was perhaps the first literary cyborg, in <i>Le Myst&#xE8;re des XV</i> (later translated as <i>The Nyctalope on Mars</i>). <a href="/wiki/Edmond_Hamilton" title="Edmond Hamilton">Edmond Hamilton</a> presented space explorers with a mixture of organic and machine parts in his novel <i>The Comet Doom</i> in 1928. He later featured the talking, living brain of an old scientist, Simon Wright, floating around in a transparent case, in all the adventures of his famous hero, <a href="/wiki/Captain_Future" title="Captain Future">Captain Future</a>. He uses the term explicitly in the 1962 short story, &quot;After a Judgment Day,&quot; to describe the &quot;mechanical analogs&quot; called &quot;Charlies,&quot; explaining that &quot;[c]yborgs, they had been called from the first one in the 1960s...cybernetic organisms.&quot; In the short story &quot;No Woman Born&quot; in 1944, <a href="/wiki/C._L._Moore" title="C. L. Moore">C. L. Moore</a> wrote of Deirdre, a dancer, whose body was burned completely and whose brain was placed in a faceless but beautiful and supple mechanical body.</p>
<p>The term was coined by <a href="/wiki/Manfred_Clynes" title="Manfred Clynes">Manfred E. Clynes</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nathan_S._Kline" title="Nathan S. Kline">Nathan S. Kline</a> in 1960 to refer to their conception of an <a href="/wiki/Superhuman" title="Superhuman">enhanced human</a> being who could survive in <a href="/wiki/Extrasolar_planet" class="mw-redirect" title="Extrasolar planet">extraterrestrial</a> environments:</p>

<p>Their concept was the outcome of thinking about the need for an intimate relationship between human and machine as the new frontier of <a href="/wiki/Space_exploration" title="Space exploration">space exploration</a> was beginning to open up. A designer of <a href="/wiki/Physiology" title="Physiology">physiological</a> instrumentation and electronic data-processing systems, Clynes was the chief research scientist in the Dynamic Simulation Laboratory at Rockland State Hospital in New York.</p>
<p>The term first appears in print five months earlier when <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> reported on the Psychophysiological Aspects of Space Flight Symposium where Clynes and Kline first presented their paper.</p>

<p>A book titled <i>Cyborg: Digital Destiny and Human Possibility in the Age of the <a href="/wiki/Wearable_computing" class="mw-redirect" title="Wearable computing">Wearable Computer</a></i> was published by <a href="/wiki/Doubleday_(publisher)" title="Doubleday (publisher)">Doubleday</a> in 2001. Some of the ideas in the book were incorporated into the 35&#xA0;mm motion picture film <a href="/wiki/Cyberman_(movie)" class="mw-redirect" title="Cyberman (movie)"><i>Cyberman</i></a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Cyborg_tissues_in_engineering">Cyborg tissues in engineering</span></h2>
<p>Cyborgs tissues structured with carbon nanotubes and plant or fungal cells have been used in artificial tissue engineering to produce new materials for mechanical and electrical uses. The work was presented by Di Giacomo and Maresca at MRS 2013 Spring conference on Apr, 3rd, talk number SS4.04. The cyborg obtained is inexpensive, light and has unique mechanical properties. It can also be shaped in desired forms. Cells combined with MWCNTs co-precipitated as a specific aggregate of cells and nanotubes that formed a viscous material. Likewise, dried cells still acted as a stable matrix for the MWCNT network. When observed by optical microscopy the material resembled an artificial &#x201C;tissue&#x201D; composed of highly packed cells. The effect of cell drying is manifested by their &#x201C;ghost cell&#x201D; appearance. A rather specific physical interaction between MWCNTs and cells was observed by electron microscopy suggesting that the cell wall (the most outer part of fungal and plant cells) may play a major active role in establishing a CNTs network and its stabilization. This novel material can be used in a wide range of electronic applications from heating to sensing and has the potential to open important new avenues to be exploited in electromagnetic shielding for radio frequency electronics and aerospace technology. In particular using Candida albicans cells cyborg tissue materials with temperature sensing properties have been reported. </p>

<p>Generally, the term &quot;cyborg&quot; is used to refer to a human with <a href="/wiki/Bionics" title="Bionics">bionic</a>, or robotic, <a href="/wiki/Prosthesis" title="Prosthesis">implants</a>.</p>
<p>In current <a href="/wiki/Prosthesis" title="Prosthesis">prosthetic</a> applications, the <a href="/wiki/C-Leg" class="mw-redirect" title="C-Leg">C-Leg</a> system developed by <a href="/w/index.php?title=Otto_Bock_HealthCare&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Otto Bock HealthCare (page does not exist)">Otto Bock HealthCare</a> is used to replace a <a href="/wiki/Human_leg" title="Human leg">human leg</a> that has been amputated because of injury or illness. The use of sensors in the artificial C-Leg aids in walking significantly by attempting to replicate the user&apos;s natural gait, as it would be prior to amputation. Prostheses like the C-Leg and the more advanced <a href="/w/index.php?title=ILimb&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="ILimb (page does not exist)">iLimb</a> are considered by some to be the first real steps towards the next generation of real-world cyborg applications.

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Vision_science" title="Vision science">vision science</a>, direct <a href="/wiki/Brain_implant" title="Brain implant">brain implants</a> have been used to treat non-<a href="/wiki/Congenital" class="mw-redirect" title="Congenital">congenital</a> (acquired) blindness. One of the first scientists to come up with a working brain interface to restore sight was private researcher <a href="/wiki/William_H._Dobelle" title="William H. Dobelle">William Dobelle</a>. Dobelle&apos;s first prototype was implanted into &quot;Jerry&quot;, a man blinded in adulthood, in 1978. A single-array BCI containing 68 electrodes was implanted onto Jerry&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Visual_cortex" title="Visual cortex">visual cortex</a> and succeeded in producing <a href="/wiki/Phosphenes" class="mw-redirect" title="Phosphenes">phosphenes</a>, the sensation of seeing light. The system included cameras mounted on glasses to send signals to the implant. Initially, the implant allowed Jerry to see shades of grey in a limited field of vision at a low frame-rate. This also required him to be hooked up to a two-ton mainframe, but shrinking electronics and faster computers made his artificial eye more portable and now enable him to perform simple tasks unassisted.</p>
<p>In 1997, Philip Kennedy, a scientist and physician, designed the world&apos;s first human cyborg, named Johnny Ray. Ray was a Vietnam veteran in Georgia who suffered a stroke. Unfortunately, Ray&apos;s body, as doctors called it, was &quot;locked in&quot;. Ray wanted his old life back so he agreed to Kennedy&apos;s experiment. Kennedy embedded a Neurotrophic Electrode near the part of Ray&apos;s brain so that Ray would be able to have some movement back in his body. The surgery went successfully, but in 2002, Johnny Ray died.</p>
<p>In 2002, Canadian Jens Naumann, also blinded in adulthood, became the first in a series of 16 paying patients to receive Dobelle&apos;s second generation implant, marking one of the earliest commercial uses of BCIs. The second generation device used a more sophisticated implant enabling better mapping of phosphenes into coherent vision. Phosphenes are spread out across the visual field in what researchers call the starry-night effect. Immediately after his implant, Jens was able to use his imperfectly restored vision to drive slowly around the parking area of the research institute.</p>
<p>In 2002, under the heading Project Cyborg, a British scientist, <a href="/wiki/Kevin_Warwick" title="Kevin Warwick">Kevin Warwick</a>, had an array of 100 electrodes fired into his nervous system in order to link his nervous system into the Internet. With this in place he successfully carried out a series of experiments including extending his nervous system over the Internet to control a robotic hand, a loudspeaker and amplifier. This is a form of extended sensory input and the first direct electronic communication between the nervous systems of two humans.</p>
<p>In 2004, under the heading Bridging the Island of the Colourblind Project, a British and completely color-blind artist, <a href="/wiki/Neil_Harbisson" title="Neil Harbisson">Neil Harbisson</a>, started wearing an <a href="/wiki/Eyeborg" title="Eyeborg">eyeborg</a> on his head in order to perceive colors through hearing. His prosthetic device was included within his 2004 passport photograph which has been claimed to confirm his cyborg status. In 2012 at <a href="/wiki/TEDGlobal" class="mw-redirect" title="TEDGlobal">TEDGlobal</a>, Harbisson explained that he did not feel like a cyborg when he started to use the <a href="/wiki/Eyeborg" title="Eyeborg">eyeborg</a>, he started to feel like a cyborg when he noticed that the software and his brain had united and given him an extra sense.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="In_medicine">In medicine</span></h3>
<p>In medicine, there are two important and different types of cyborgs: the restorative and the enhanced. Restorative technologies &quot;restore lost function, organs, and limbs&quot;. The key aspect of restorative cyborgization is the repair of broken or missing processes to revert to a healthy or average level of function. There is no enhancement to the original faculties and processes that were lost.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the enhanced cyborg &quot;follows a principle, and it is the principle of optimal performance: maximising output (the information or modifications obtained) and minimising input (the energy expended in the process)&quot;. Thus, the enhanced cyborg intends to exceed normal processes or even gain new functions that were not originally present.</p>
<p>Although prostheses in general supplement lost or damaged body parts with the integration of a mechanical artifice, bionic implants in medicine allow model organs or body parts to mimic the original function more closely. <a href="/wiki/Michael_Chorost" title="Michael Chorost">Michael Chorost</a> wrote a memoir of his experience with cochlear implants, or bionic ear, titled &quot;Rebuilt: How Becoming Part Computer Made Me More Human.&quot; <a href="/wiki/Jesse_Sullivan" title="Jesse Sullivan">Jesse Sullivan</a> became one of the first people to operate a fully robotic limb through a nerve-muscle graft, enabling him a complex range of motions beyond that of previous prosthetics. By 2004, a fully functioning <a href="/wiki/Artificial_heart" title="Artificial heart">artificial heart</a> was developed. The continued technological development of bionic and nanotechnologies begins to raise the question of enhancement, and of the future possibilities for cyborgs which surpass the original functionality of the biological model. The ethics and desirability of &quot;enhancement prosthetics&quot; have been debated; their proponents include the <a href="/wiki/Transhumanism" title="Transhumanism">transhumanist</a> movement, with its belief that new technologies can assist the human race in developing beyond its present, normative limitations such as aging and disease, as well as other, more general incapacities, such as limitations on speed, strength, endurance, and intelligence. Opponents of the concept describe what they believe to be biases which propel the development and acceptance of such technologies; namely, a bias towards functionality and efficiency that may compel assent to a view of human people which de-emphasizes as defining characteristics actual manifestations of humanity and personhood, in favor of definition in terms of upgrades, versions, and utility.</p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Brain-computer_interface" class="mw-redirect" title="Brain-computer interface">brain-computer interface</a>, or BCI, provides a direct path of communication from the brain to an external device, effectively creating a cyborg. Research of Invasive BCIs, which utilize electrodes implanted directly into the grey matter of the brain, has focused on restoring damaged eyesight in the blind and providing functionality to paralyzed people, most notably those with severe cases, such as <a href="/wiki/Locked-In_syndrome" class="mw-redirect" title="Locked-In syndrome">Locked-In syndrome</a>. This technology could enable people who are missing a limb or are in a wheelchair the power to control the devices that aide them through neural signals sent from the brain implants directly to computers or the devices. It is possible that this technology will also eventually be used with healthy people.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Deep_brain_stimulation" title="Deep brain stimulation">Deep brain stimulation</a> is a neurological surgical procedure used for therapeutic purposes. This process has aided in treating patients diagnosed with <a href="/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease" title="Parkinson&apos;s disease">Parkinson&apos;s disease</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease" title="Alzheimer&apos;s disease">Alzheimer&apos;s disease</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tourette_syndrome" title="Tourette syndrome">Tourette syndrome</a>, epilepsy, chronic headaches, and mental disorders. After the patient is unconscious, through anesthesia, brain pacemakers or electrodes, are implanted into the region of the brain where the cause of the disease is present. The region of the brain is then stimulated by bursts of electric current to disrupt the oncoming surge of seizures. Like all invasive procedures, deep brain stimulation may put the patient at a higher risk. However, there have been more improvements in recent years with deep brain stimulation than any available drug treatment.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Retinal_implant" title="Retinal implant">Retinal implants</a> are another form of cyborgization in medicine. The theory behind retinal stimulation to restore vision to people suffering from retinitis pigmentosa and vision loss due to aging (conditions in which people have an abnormally low amount of ganglion cells) is that the retinal implant and electrical stimulation would act as a substitute for the missing ganglion cells (cells which connect the eye to the brain.)</p>
<p>While work to perfect this technology is still being done, there have already been major advances in the use of electronic stimulation of the retina to allow the eye to sense patterns of light. A specialized camera is worn by the subject, such as on the frames of their glasses, which converts the image into a pattern of electrical stimulation. A chip located in the user&apos;s eye would then electrically stimulate the retina with this pattern by exciting certain nerve endings which transmit the image to the optic centers of the brain and the image would then appear to the user. If technological advances proceed as planned this technology may be used by thousands of blind people and restore vision to most of them.</p>
<p>A similar process has been created to aide people who have lost their vocal cords. This experimental device would do away with previously used robotic sounding voice simulators. The transmission of sound would start with a surgery to redirect the nerve that controls the voice and sound production to a muscle in the neck, where a nearby sensor would be able to pick up its electrical signals. The signals would then move to a processor which would control the timing and pitch of a voice simulator. That simulator would then vibrate producing a multitonal sound which could be shaped into words by the mouth.</p>

Lieber</a>, the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Mark_Hyman_Jr.&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Mark Hyman Jr. (page does not exist)">Mark Hyman Jr.</a> Professor of Chemistry, and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Daniel_Kohane&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Daniel Kohane (page does not exist)">Daniel Kohane</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Harvard_Medical_School" title="Harvard Medical School">Harvard Medical School</a> <a href="/wiki/Anesthesiology" title="Anesthesiology">Anesthesiology</a> Professor at <a href="/wiki/Boston_Children%27s_Hospital" title="Boston Children&apos;s Hospital">Boston Children&apos;s Hospital</a>.</p>
<p>In 2014, researchers from the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign" class="mw-redirect" title="University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a> and <a href="/wiki/Washington_University_in_St._Louis" title="Washington University in St. Louis">Washington University in St. Louis</a> had developed a device that could keep a heart beating endlessly. By using <a href="/wiki/3D_printing" title="3D printing">3D printing</a> and computer modeling these scientist developed an electronic membrane that could successfully replace pacemakers. The device utilizes a &quot;spider-web like network of sensors and electrodes&quot; to monitor and maintain a normal heart-rate with electrical stimuli. Unlike traditional pacemakers that are similar from patient to patient, the elastic heart glove is made custom by using high-resolution imaging technology. The first prototype was created to fit a rabbit&apos;s heart, operating the organ in an oxygen and nutrient-rich solution. The stretchable material and circuits of the apparatus were first constructed by Professor <a href="/wiki/John_A._Rogers" title="John A. Rogers">John A. Rogers</a> in which the electrodes are arranged in a s-shape design to allow them to expand and bend without breaking. Although the device is only currently used as a research tool to study changes in heart rate, in the future the membrane may serve as a safeguard from heart attacks.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="In_the_military">In the military</span></h3>
<p>Military organizations&apos; research has recently focused on the utilization of <a href="/wiki/Remote_control_animal" title="Remote control animal">cyborg animals</a> for the purposes of a supposed tactical advantage. <a href="/wiki/DARPA" title="DARPA">DARPA</a> has announced its interest in developing &quot;cyborg insects&quot; to transmit data from sensors implanted into the insect during the <a href="/wiki/Pupa" title="Pupa">pupal</a> stage. The insect&apos;s motion would be controlled from a Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) and could conceivably survey an environment or detect explosives and gas. Similarly, DARPA is developing a <a href="/wiki/Neural" class="mw-redirect" title="Neural">neural</a> implant to remotely control the movement of <a href="/wiki/Sharks" class="mw-redirect" title="Sharks">sharks</a>. The shark&apos;s unique senses would then be exploited to provide data feedback in relation to enemy ship movement or underwater explosives.</p>
<p>In 2006, researchers at Cornell University invented a new surgical procedure to implant artificial structures into insects during their metamorphic development. The first insect cyborgs, <a href="/wiki/Moths" class="mw-redirect" title="Moths">moths</a> with integrated electronics in their <a href="/wiki/Thorax" title="Thorax">thorax</a>, were demonstrated by the same researchers. <span id="HI-MEMS"></span>The initial success of the techniques has resulted in increased research and the creation of a program called Hybrid-Insect-MEMS, HI-MEMS. Its goal, according to <a href="/wiki/DARPA" title="DARPA">DARPA</a>&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Microsystems_Technology_Office" title="Microsystems Technology Office">Microsystems Technology Office</a>, is to develop &quot;tightly coupled machine-insect interfaces by placing micro-mechanical systems inside the insects during the early stages of metamorphosis&quot;.</p>
<p>The use of neural implants has recently been attempted, with success, on cockroaches. Surgically applied electrodes were put on the insect, which were remotely controlled by a human. The results, although sometimes different, basically showed that the cockroach could be controlled by the impulses it received through the electrodes. <a href="/wiki/DARPA" title="DARPA">DARPA</a> is now funding this research because of its obvious beneficial applications to the military and other areas</p>
<p>In 2009 at the <a href="/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers" title="Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</a> (IEEE) Micro-electronic mechanical systems (MEMS) conference in <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>, researchers demonstrated the first &quot;wireless&quot; flying-beetle cyborg. Engineers at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley" title="University of California, Berkeley">University of California</a> at <a href="/wiki/Berkeley,_California" title="Berkeley, California">Berkeley</a> have pioneered the design of a &quot;remote controlled beetle&quot;, funded by the DARPA HI-MEMS Program. Filmed evidence of this can be viewed here. This was followed later that year by the demonstration of wireless control of a &quot;lift-assisted&quot; moth-cyborg.</p>
<p>Eventually researchers plan to develop HI-MEMS for dragonflies, bees, rats and pigeons. For the HI-MEMS <a href="/wiki/Cybernetic" class="mw-redirect" title="Cybernetic">cybernetic</a> bug to be considered a success, it must fly 100 metres (330&#xA0;ft) from a starting point, guided via computer into a controlled landing within 5 metres (16&#xA0;ft) of a specific end point. Once landed, the cybernetic bug must remain in place.</p>

<p>The concept of the cyborg is often associated with science fiction. However, many artists have tried to create public awareness of cybernetic organisms; these can range from paintings to installations. Some artists who create such works are <a href="/wiki/Neil_Harbisson" title="Neil Harbisson">Neil Harbisson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Moon_Ribas" title="Moon Ribas">Moon Ribas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Patricia_Piccinini" title="Patricia Piccinini">Patricia Piccinini</a>, <a href="/wiki/Steve_Mann" title="Steve Mann">Steve Mann</a>, <a href="/wiki/Orlan" title="Orlan">Orlan</a>, <a href="/wiki/H._R._Giger" title="H. R. Giger">H. R. Giger</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lee_Bul" title="Lee Bul">Lee Bul</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wafaa_Bilal" title="Wafaa Bilal">Wafaa Bilal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tim_Hawkinson" title="Tim Hawkinson">Tim Hawkinson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stelarc" title="Stelarc">Stelarc</a>.</p>
<p>Stelarc is a performance artist who has visually probed and acoustically amplified his body. He uses medical instruments, prosthetics, robotics, virtual reality systems, the Internet and biotechnology to explore alternate, intimate and involuntary interfaces with the body. He has made three films of the inside of his body and has performed with a third hand and a virtual arm. Between 1976&#x2013;1988 he completed 25 body suspension performances with hooks into the skin. For &apos;Third Ear&apos; he surgically constructed an extra ear within his arm that was internet enabled, making it a publicly accessible acoustical organ for people in other places. He is presently performing as his avatar from his <a href="/wiki/Second_life" class="mw-redirect" title="Second life">second life</a> site.</p>
<p>Tim Hawkinson promotes the idea that bodies and machines are coming together as one, where human features are combined with technology to create the Cyborg. Hawkinson&apos;s piece <i>Emoter</i> presented how society is now dependent on technology.</p>
<p>Wafaa Bilal is an Iraqi-American performance artist who had a small 10 megapixel digital camera surgically implanted into the back of his head, part of a project entitled 3rd I. For one year, beginning 15 December 2010, an image is captured once per minute 24 hours a day and streamed live to <span class="url"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.3rdi.me">www<wbr>.3rdi<wbr>.me</a></span> and the Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art. The site also displays Bilal&apos;s location via GPS. Bilal says that the reason why he put the camera in the back of the head was to make an &quot;allegorical statement about the things we don&apos;t see and leave behind.&quot; As a professor at NYU, this project has raised privacy issues, and so Bilal has been asked to ensure that his camera does not take photographs in NYU buildings.</p>
<p>Machines are becoming more ubiquitous in the artistic process itself, with computerized drawing pads replacing pen and paper, and drum machines becoming nearly as popular as human drummers. This is perhaps most notable in <a href="/wiki/Generative_art" title="Generative art">generative art</a> and <a href="/wiki/Generative_music" title="Generative music">music</a>. Composers such as Brian Eno have developed and utilized software which can build entire musical scores from a few basic mathematical parameters.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Scott_Draves" title="Scott Draves">Scott Draves</a> is a generative artist whose work is explicitly described as a &quot;cyborg mind&quot;. His <a href="/wiki/Electric_Sheep" title="Electric Sheep">Electric Sheep</a> project generates abstract art by combining the work of many computers and people over the internet.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Artists_as_cyborgs">Artists as cyborgs</span></h3>
<p>Artists have explored the term cyborg from a perspective involving imagination. Some work to make an abstract idea of technological and human-bodily union apparent to reality in an art form utilizing varying mediums, from sculptures and drawings to digital renderings. Artists that seek to make cyborg-based fantasies a reality often call themselves cyborg artists, or may consider their artwork &quot;cyborg&quot;. How an artist or their work may be considered cyborg will vary depending upon the interpreter&apos;s flexibility with the term. Scholars that rely upon a strict, technical description of cyborg, often going by Norbert Wiener&apos;s cybernetic theory and Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline&apos;s first use of the term, would likely argue that most cyborg artists do not qualify to be considered cyborgs. Scholars considering a more flexible description of cyborgs may argue it incorporates more than cybernetics. Others may speak of defining subcategories, or specialized cyborg types, that qualify different levels of cyborg at which technology influences an individual. This may range from technological instruments being external, temporary, and removable to being fully integrated and permanent. Nonetheless, cyborg artists are artists. Being so, it can be expected for them to incorporate the cyborg idea rather than a strict, technical representation of the term, seeing how their work will sometimes revolve around other purposes outside of cyborgism.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="In_body_modification">In body modification</span></h3>
<p>As medical technology becomes more advanced, some techniques and innovations are adopted by the body modification community. While not yet cyborgs in the strict definition of Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline, technological developments like implantable silicon silk electronics, augmented reality and QR codes are bridging the disconnect between technology and the body. Hypothetical technologies such as digital tattoo interfaces would blend body modification aesthetics with interactivity and functionality, bringing a <a href="/wiki/Transhumanist" class="mw-redirect" title="Transhumanist">transhumanist</a> way of life into present day reality.</p>
<p>In addition, it is quite plausible for anxiety expression to manifest. Individuals may experience pre-implantation feelings of fear and nervousness. To this end, individuals may also embody feelings of uneasiness, particularly in a socialized setting, due to their post-operative, technologically augmented bodies, and mutual unfamiliarity with the mechanical insertion. Anxieties may be linked to notions of otherness or a cyborged identity.</p>

<p>Cyborgs have become a well-known part of science fiction literature and other media. Although many of these characters may be technically <a href="/wiki/Android_(robot)" title="Android (robot)">androids</a>, they are often referred to as cyborgs.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="In_space">In space</span></h3>
<p>Sending humans to space is a dangerous task in which the implementation of various cyborg technologies could be used in the future for risk mitigation. Stephen Hawking, a renowned physicist, stated &quot;Life on Earth is at the ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by a disaster such as sudden global warming, nuclear war... I think the human race has no future if it doesn&apos;t go into space.&quot; The difficulties associated with space travel could mean it might be centuries before humans ever become a multi-planet species. There are many <a href="/wiki/Effect_of_spaceflight_on_the_human_body" title="Effect of spaceflight on the human body">effect of spaceflight on the human body</a>. One major issue of space exploration is the biological need for oxygen. If this necessity was taken out of the equation, space exploration would be revolutionized. A theory proposed by Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline is aimed at tackling this problem. The two scientists theorized that the use of an inverse fuel cell that is &quot;capable of reducing CO2 to its components with removal of the carbon and re-circulation of the oxygen...&quot; could make breathing unnecessary. Another prominent issue is <a href="/wiki/Radiation" title="Radiation">radiation</a> exposure. Yearly, the average human on earth is exposed to approximately 0.30 rem of radiation, while an astronaut aboard the International Space Station for 90 days is exposed to 9 rem. To tackle the issue, Clynes and Kline theorized a cyborg containing a sensor that would detect radiation levels and a Rose osmotic pump &quot;which would automatically inject protective pharmaceuticals in appropriate doses.&quot; Experiments injecting these protective pharmaceuticals into monkeys have shown positive results in increasing radiation resistance.</p>
<p>Although the effects of spaceflight on our body is an important issue, the advancement of propulsion technology is just as important. With our current technology, it would take us about 260 days to get to mars. A study backed by NASA proposes an interesting way to tackle this issue through deep sleep, or <a href="/wiki/Torpor" title="Torpor">torpor</a>. With this technique, it would &quot;reduce astronauts&apos; metabolic functions with existing medical procedures&quot;. So far experiments have only resulted in patients being in torpor state for one week. Advancements to allow for longer states of deep sleep would lower the cost of the trip to mars as a result of reduced astronaut resource consumption.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cyborgization_in_critical_deaf_studies">Cyborgization in critical deaf studies</span></h3>
<p><a href="/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Michael_Valente&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Joseph Michael Valente (page does not exist)">Joseph Michael Valente</a>, describes &quot;cyborgization&quot; as an attempt to codify &quot;normalization&quot; through cochlear implantation in young deaf children. Drawing from Paddy Ladd&apos;s work on Deaf epistemology and <a href="/wiki/Donna_Haraway" title="Donna Haraway">Donna Haraway</a>&apos;s Cyborg ontology, Valente &quot;use[s] the concept of the cyborg as a way of agitating constructions of cyborg perfection (for the deaf child that would be to become fully hearing)&quot;. He claims that cochlear implant manufacturers advertise and sell cochlear implants as a mechanical device as well as an uncomplicated medical &quot;miracle cure&quot;. Valente criticizes cochlear implant researchers whose studies largely to date do not include cochlear implant recipients, despite cochlear implants having been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1984. Pamela J. Kincheloe discusses the representation of the cochlear implant in media and popular culture as a case study for present and future responses to human alteration and enhancement.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cyborg_Foundation">Cyborg Foundation</span></h3>
<p>In 2010, the <a href="/wiki/Cyborg_Foundation" title="Cyborg Foundation">Cyborg Foundation</a> became the world&apos;s first international organization dedicated to help humans become cyborgs. The foundation was created by cyborg <a href="/wiki/Neil_Harbisson" title="Neil Harbisson">Neil Harbisson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Moon_Ribas" title="Moon Ribas">Moon Ribas</a> as a response to the growing amount of letters and emails received from people around the world interested in becoming a cyborg. The foundation&apos;s main aims are to extend human senses and abilities by creating and applying cybernetic extensions to the body, to promote the use of cybernetics in cultural events and to defend cyborg rights. In 2010, the foundation, based in <a href="/wiki/Matar%C3%B3" title="Matar&#xF3;">Matar&#xF3;</a> (Barcelona), was the overall winner of the Cre@tic Awards, organized by Tecnocampus Matar&#xF3;.</p>
<p>In 2012, Spanish film director Rafel Duran Torrent, created a short film about the Cyborg Foundation. In 2013, the film won the Grand Jury Prize at the <a href="/wiki/Sundance_Film_Festival" title="Sundance Film Festival">Sundance Film Festival</a>&apos;s Focus Forward Filmmakers Competition and was awarded with $100,000 USD.</p>
