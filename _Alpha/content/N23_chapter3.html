The metropolitan area is the <a href="/wiki/List_of_Metropolitan_Statistical_Areas" title="List of Metropolitan Statistical Areas">12th largest by population in the United States,</a> with approximately 4.3&#xA0;million people as of 2010. In addition, Phoenix is the <a href="/wiki/County_seat" title="County seat">county seat</a> of <a href="/wiki/Maricopa_County,_Arizona" title="Maricopa County, Arizona">Maricopa County</a> and is one of the largest cities in the United States by land area.</p><p>Settled in 1867 as an agricultural community near the confluence of the <a href="/wiki/Salt_River_(Arizona)" title="Salt River (Arizona)">Salt</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gila_River" title="Gila River">Gila Rivers</a>, Phoenix incorporated as a city in 1881. Located in the northeastern reaches of the <a href="/wiki/Sonoran_Desert" title="Sonoran Desert">Sonoran Desert</a>, Phoenix has a <a href="/wiki/Subtropical" class="mw-redirect" title="Subtropical">subtropical</a> <a href="/wiki/Desert_climate" title="Desert climate">desert climate</a>. Despite this, its canal system led to a thriving farming community, many of the original crops remaining important parts of the Phoenix economy for decades, such as alfalfa, cotton, citrus, and hay (which was important for the cattle industry). In fact, the &quot;Five C&apos;s&quot; (Cotton, Cattle, Citrus, Climate, and Copper), remained the driving forces of Phoenix&apos;s economy until after World War II, when high-tech industries began to move into the valley and air conditioning made residences much more comfortable in the very hot summers.</p><p>The city averaged a 4 percent annual population growth rate over a 40-year period from the mid-1960s to the mid-2000s. This growth rate slowed during the <a href="/wiki/Great_Recession_in_the_United_States" title="Great Recession in the United States">Great Recession</a> of 2007&#x2013;09, and has rebounded slowly. Phoenix is the cultural center of the Valley of the Sun, as well as the entire state.</p><p></p><p></p><p>For more than 2,000&#xA0;years, the <a href="/wiki/Hohokam" title="Hohokam">Hohokam</a> peoples occupied the land that would become Phoenix. The Hohokam created roughly 135&#xA0;miles (217&#xA0;km) of irrigation canals, making the desert land <a href="/wiki/Arable_land" title="Arable land">arable</a>. Paths of these canals would later become used for the modern <a href="/wiki/Arizona_Canal" title="Arizona Canal">Arizona Canal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Central_Arizona_Project" title="Central Arizona Project">Central Arizona Project</a> Canal, and the <a href="/wiki/Hayden-Rhodes_Aqueduct" title="Hayden-Rhodes Aqueduct">Hayden-Rhodes Aqueduct</a>. The Hohokam also carried out extensive trade with the nearby <a href="/wiki/Anasazi" class="mw-redirect" title="Anasazi">Anasazi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mogollon_culture" title="Mogollon culture">Mogollon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sinagua" title="Sinagua">Sinagua</a>, as well as with the more distant <a href="/wiki/Mesoamerican" class="mw-redirect" title="Mesoamerican">Mesoamerican</a> civilizations. It is believed that between 1300 and 1450, periods of drought and severe floods led to the Hohokam civilization&apos;s abandonment of the area.</p><p>After the departure of the Hohokam, groups of <a href="/wiki/Akimel_O%27odham" class="mw-redirect" title="Akimel O&apos;odham">Akimel O&apos;odham</a> (commonly known as Pima), <a href="/wiki/Tohono_O%E2%80%99odham" class="mw-redirect" title="Tohono O&#x2019;odham">Tohono O&#x2019;odham</a> and <a href="/wiki/Maricopa_people" title="Maricopa people">Maricopa</a> tribes began to use the area, as well as segments of the <a href="/wiki/Yavapai_people" class="mw-redirect" title="Yavapai people">Yavapai</a> and Apache. The O&apos;odham were offshoots of the <a href="/wiki/Sobaipuri" title="Sobaipuri">Sobaipuri</a> tribe, who in turn were thought to be the descendants of the formerly urbanized Hohokam.</p><p>The Akimel O&#x2019;odham were the major Indian group in the area, and lived in small villages, with well-defined irrigation systems, which spread over the entire Gila River Valley, from Florence in the east to the Estrellas in the west. Their crops included corn, beans and squash for food, while cotton and tobacco were also cultivated. Mostly a peaceful group, they did band together with the Maricopa for their mutual protection against incursions by both the Yuma and Apache tribes. The Maricopa are part of the larger Yuma people, however they migrated east from the lower Colorado and Gila Rivers in the early 1800s, when they began to be enemies with their Yuma brethren, settling amongst the existing communities of the Akimel O&apos;odham.</p><p>The Tohono O&apos;odham lived in the region as well, but their main concentration was to the south, and stretched all the way to the Mexican border. Living in small settlements, the O&apos;odham were seasonal farmers who took advantage of the rains, rather than the large-scale irrigation of the Akimel. They grew crops such as sweet Indian corn, tapery beans, squash, lentils sugar cane and melons, as well as taking advantage of native plants, such as saguaro fruits, cholla buds, mesquite tree beans, and mesquite candy (sap from the mesquite tree). They also hunted local game such as deer, rabbit and javalina for meat.</p><p>When the <a href="/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War" title="Mexican&#x2013;American War">Mexican&#x2013;American War</a> ended in 1848, Mexico sold its northern zone to the United States and residents became U.S. citizens. The Phoenix area became part of the <a href="/wiki/New_Mexico_Territory" title="New Mexico Territory">New Mexico Territory</a>. In 1863 the mining town of <a href="/wiki/Wickenburg,_Arizona" title="Wickenburg, Arizona">Wickenburg</a> was the first to be established in what is now Maricopa County, to the northwest of modern Phoenix. At the time Maricopa County had not yet been incorporated: the land was within <a href="/wiki/Yavapai_County,_Arizona" title="Yavapai County, Arizona">Yavapai County</a>, which included the major town of Prescott to the north of Wickenburg.</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/U.S._Army" class="mw-redirect" title="U.S. Army">U.S. Army</a> created <a href="/wiki/Fort_McDowell,_Arizona" title="Fort McDowell, Arizona">Fort McDowell</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Verde_River" title="Verde River">Verde River</a> in 1865 to forestall Native American uprisings. The fort established a camp on the south side of the Salt River by 1866, which was the first non-native settlement in the valley after the decline of the Hohokam. In later years, other nearby settlements would form and merge to become the city of <a href="/wiki/Tempe,_Arizona" title="Tempe, Arizona">Tempe</a>, but this community was incorporated after Phoenix.</p><p>The history of the city of Phoenix begins with <a href="/wiki/Jack_Swilling" title="Jack Swilling">Jack Swilling</a>, a Confederate veteran of the Civil War. In 1867, while traveling through the Salt River Valley, he saw a potential for farming, much like the military had already cultivated further east, near Fort McDowell. He formed a small community that same year about 4&#xA0;miles (6&#xA0;km) east of the present city. <a href="/wiki/Phillip_Darrell_Duppa" title="Phillip Darrell Duppa">Lord Darrell Duppa</a>, one of the original settlers in Swilling&apos;s party, suggested the name &quot;Phoenix&quot;, as it described a city born from the ruins of a former civilization.</p><p>The Board of Supervisors in Yavapai County, which at the time encompassed Phoenix, officially recognized the new town on May 4, 1868, and the first post office was established the following month, with Swilling as the postmaster. On February 12, 1871, the territorial legislature created Maricopa County, the sixth one formed in the Arizona Territory, by dividing Yavapai County. The first election for county office was held in 1871, when Tom Barnum was elected the first sheriff, running unopposed when the other two candidates, John A. Chenowth and Jim Favorite, fought a duel wherein Chenowth killed Favorite, and then was forced to withdraw from the race.</p><p>The town grew during the 1870s, and President <a href="/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant" title="Ulysses S. Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> issued a <a href="/wiki/Land_patent" title="Land patent">land patent</a> for the present site of Phoenix on April 10, 1874. By 1875, the town had a telegraph office, sixteen saloons, and four dance halls, but the &quot;townsite-commissioner form of government&quot; needed an overhaul, so that year an election was held in which three village trustees, as well as several other officials, were elected. By 1880, the town&apos;s population stood at 2,453.</p><p>By 1881, Phoenix&apos;s continued growth made the existing village structure with a board of trustees obsolete. The Territorial Legislature passed &quot;The Phoenix Charter Bill&quot;, incorporating Phoenix and providing for a <a href="/wiki/Mayor%E2%80%93council_government" title="Mayor&#x2013;council government">mayor-council government</a>, and became official on February 25, 1881 when it was signed by Governor <a href="/wiki/John_C._Fremont" class="mw-redirect" title="John C. Fremont">John C. Fremont</a>, officially incorporating Phoenix as a city with an approximate population of 2,500.</p><p>In the 1880s, the arrival of the railroad in the valley was the first of several key events that altered the economy of Phoenix. Phoenix became a trade center, with its products reaching eastern and western markets. In response, the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce was organized on November 4, 1888. Earlier in 1888 the city offices were moved into the new City Hall, at Washington and Central. When the territorial capital was moved from Prescott to Phoenix in 1889 the temporary territorial offices were also located in City Hall. With the arrival of the <a href="/wiki/Santa_Fe,_Prescott_and_Phoenix_Railroad" class="mw-redirect" title="Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix Railroad">Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix Railroad</a> in 1895, Phoenix was connected to Prescott, Flagstaff and other northern state communities. The increased access to commerce expedited the city&apos;s economic rise. The year 1895 also saw the establishment of <a href="/wiki/Phoenix_Union_High_School" title="Phoenix Union High School">Phoenix Union High School</a>, with an enrollment of 90.</p><p>On February 25, 1901, Governor Murphy dedicated the permanent Capitol building, and the Carnegie Free Library opened seven years later, on February 18, 1908, dedicated by Benjamin Fowler. The <a href="/wiki/Newlands_Reclamation_Act" title="Newlands Reclamation Act">National Reclamation Act</a> was signed by President <a href="/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> in 1902, which allowed for dams to be built on waterways in the west for reclamation purposes. The first dam constructed under the act, the <a href="/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt_Dam" title="Theodore Roosevelt Dam">Theodore Roosevelt Dam</a> began in 1903. It supplied both water and electricity, becoming the first multi-purpose dam, and Roosevelt himself attended the official dedication on May 18, 1911. At the time, it was the largest masonry dam in the world, forming <a href="/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt_Lake" title="Theodore Roosevelt Lake">Theodore Roosevelt Lake</a> in the mountain east of Phoenix.</p><p>On February 14, 1912, under President <a href="/wiki/William_Howard_Taft" title="William Howard Taft">William Howard Taft</a>, Phoenix became the capital of the newly formed state of Arizona. This occurred just six months after Taft had vetoed a joint congressional resolution granting statehood to Arizona, due to his disapproval of the state constitution&apos;s position regarding the recall of judges. In 1913 Phoenix adopted a new form of government, changing from a mayor-council system to <a href="/wiki/Council-Manager_government" class="mw-redirect" title="Council-Manager government">council-manager</a>, making it one of the first cities in the United States with this form of city government. After statehood, Phoenix&apos;s growth started to accelerate, and eight years later, its population had reached 29,053. In 1920 Phoenix would see its first skyscraper, the Heard Building. In 1929 <a href="/wiki/Phoenix_Sky_Harbor_International_Airport" title="Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport">Sky Harbor</a> was officially opened, at the time owned by <a href="/wiki/Grand_Canyon_Airlines" title="Grand Canyon Airlines">Scenic Airways</a>. It would later be purchased by the city in 1935, who operates it to this day.</p><p>On March 4, 1930, former U.S. President Calvin Coolidge dedicated a dam on the Gila River named in his honor. However, the state had just been through a long drought, and the reservoir which was supposed to be behind the dam was virtually dry. The humorist <a href="/wiki/Will_Rogers" title="Will Rogers">Will Rogers</a>, who was also on hand as a guest speaker joked, &quot;If that was my lake I&apos;d mow it.&quot; Phoenix&apos;s population had more than doubled during the 1920s, and now stood at 48,118. It was also during the 1930s that Phoenix and its surrounding area began to be called &quot;The Valley of the Sun&quot;, which was an advertising slogan invented to boost tourism.</p><p>During World War II, Phoenix&apos;s economy shifted to that of a distribution center, transforming into an &quot;embryonic industrial city&quot; with the mass production of military supplies. There were three air force fields in the area: <a href="/wiki/Luke_Air_Force_Base" title="Luke Air Force Base">Luke Field</a>, <a href="/wiki/Williams_Air_Force_Base" title="Williams Air Force Base">Williams Field</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Falcon_Field_(Arizona)" title="Falcon Field (Arizona)">Falcon Field</a>, as well as two large pilot training camps, <a href="/wiki/Thunderbird_Field_No._1" title="Thunderbird Field No. 1">Thunderbird Field No. 1</a> in Glendale and <a href="/wiki/Scottsdale_Airport" title="Scottsdale Airport">Thunderbird Field No. 2</a> in Scottsdale.</p><p>A town that had just over sixty-five thousand residents in 1940 became America&apos;s sixth largest city by 2010, with a population of nearly 1.5 million, and millions more in nearby suburbs. When the war ended, many of the men who had undergone their training in Arizona returned bringing their new families. Learning of this large untapped labor pool enticed many large industries to move their operations to the area. In 1948 high-tech industry, which would become a staple of the state&apos;s economy, arrived in Phoenix when <a href="/wiki/Motorola" title="Motorola">Motorola</a> chose Phoenix for the site of its new research and development center for military electronics. Seeing the same advantages as Motorola, other high-tech companies such as <a href="/wiki/Intel" title="Intel">Intel</a> and <a href="/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas" title="McDonnell Douglas">McDonnell Douglas</a> would also move into the valley and open manufacturing operations.</p><p>By 1950, over 105,000 people resided in the city and thousands more in surrounding communities. The 1950s growth was spurred on by advances in air conditioning, which allowed both homes and businesses to offset the extreme heat experienced in Phoenix and the surrounding areas during its long summers. There was more new construction in Phoenix in 1959 alone than during the period of more than thirty years from 1914 to 1946.</p><p>Like many emerging American cities at the time, Phoenix&apos;s spectacular growth did not occur evenly. It largely took place on the city&apos;s north side, a region that was nearly all Caucasian. In 1962, one local activist testified at a <a href="/wiki/United_States_Commission_on_Civil_Rights" title="United States Commission on Civil Rights">US Commission on Civil Rights</a> hearing that of 31,000 homes that had recently sprung up in this neighborhood, not a single one had been sold to an African-American. Phoenix&apos;s African-American and Mexican-American communities remained largely sequestered on the town&apos;s south side. The color lines were so rigid that no one north of <a href="/wiki/Van_Buren_Street_(Arizona)" title="Van Buren Street (Arizona)">Van Buren Street</a> would rent to the African-American baseball star <a href="/wiki/Willie_Mays" title="Willie Mays">Willie Mays</a>, in town for spring training in the 1960s. In 1964, a reporter from the <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_Republic" title="The New Republic">New Republic</a></i> wrote of segregation in these terms: &quot;Apartheid is complete. The two cities look at each other across a golf course.&quot;</p><p>The continued rapid population growth led more businesses to the valley to take advantage of the labor pool, and manufacturing, particularly in the electronics sector, continued to grow. The convention and tourism industries saw rapid expansion during the 1960s, with tourism becoming the third largest industry by the end of the decade. In 1960 the <a href="/wiki/Phoenix_Corporate_Center" title="Phoenix Corporate Center">Phoenix Corporate Center</a> opened; at the time it was the tallest building in Arizona, topping off at 341 feet. The 1960s saw many other buildings constructed as the city expanded rapidly, including the Rosenzweig Center (1964), today called <a href="/wiki/Phoenix_City_Square" title="Phoenix City Square">Phoenix City Square</a>, the landmark <a href="/wiki/Phoenix_Financial_Center" title="Phoenix Financial Center">Phoenix Financial Center</a> (1964), as well as many of Phoenix&apos;s residential high-rises. In 1965 the <a href="/wiki/Arizona_Veterans_Memorial_Coliseum" title="Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum">Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum</a> was opened at the <a href="/wiki/Arizona_State_Fairgrounds" title="Arizona State Fairgrounds">Arizona State Fairgrounds</a>, west of downtown. When Phoenix was awarded a <a href="/wiki/National_Basketball_Association" title="National Basketball Association">NBA</a> franchise in 1968, which would be called the <a href="/wiki/Phoenix_Suns" title="Phoenix Suns">Phoenix Suns</a>, they played their home games at the Coliseum until 1992, after which they moved to <a href="/wiki/Talking_Stick_Resort_Arena" title="Talking Stick Resort Arena">Talking Stick Resort Arena</a>. In 1968, the <a href="/wiki/Central_Arizona_Project" title="Central Arizona Project">Central Arizona Project</a> was approved by President <a href="/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson" title="Lyndon B. Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a>, assuring future water supplies for Phoenix, Tucson, and the agricultural corridor in between. The following year, <a href="/wiki/Pope_Paul_VI" title="Pope Paul VI">Pope Paul VI</a> created the Diocese of Phoenix on December 2, by splitting the Archdiocese of Tucson, with <a href="/wiki/Edward_A._McCarthy" title="Edward A. McCarthy">Edward A. McCarthy</a> as the first Bishop.</p><p>In the 1970s the downtown area experienced a resurgence, with a level of construction activity not seen again until the urban real estate boom of the 2000s. By the end of the decade, Phoenix adopted the Phoenix Concept 2000 plan which split the city into urban villages, each with its own village core where greater height and density was permitted, further shaping the free-market development culture. Originally, there were 9 villages, but this has been expanded to 15 over the years (see <a href="/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona#Cityscape" title="Phoenix, Arizona">Cityscape</a> below). This officially turned Phoenix into a city of many nodes, which would later be connected by freeways. 1972 would see the opening of the <a href="/wiki/Phoenix_Symphony_Hall" title="Phoenix Symphony Hall">Phoenix Symphony Hall</a>, Other major structures which saw construction downtown during this decade were the <a href="/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Plaza_(Phoenix)" title="Wells Fargo Plaza (Phoenix)">Wells Fargo Plaza</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Chase_Tower_(Phoenix)" title="Chase Tower (Phoenix)">Chase Tower</a> (the tallest building in both Phoenix and Arizona) and the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Bank_Center_(Phoenix)" title="U.S. Bank Center (Phoenix)">U.S. Bank Center</a>.</p><p>Nominated by President <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" title="Ronald Reagan">Reagan</a>, on September 25, 1981 Phoenix resident <a href="/wiki/Sandra_Day_O%27Connor" title="Sandra Day O&apos;Connor">Sandra Day O&apos;Connor</a> broke the gender barrier on the U.S. Supreme Court, when she was sworn in as the first female judge. 1985 saw the <a href="/wiki/Palo_Verde_Nuclear_Generating_Station" title="Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station">Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station</a>, the nation&apos;s largest nuclear power plant, begin electrical production. 1987 was marked by visits by both <a href="/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II" title="Pope John Paul II">Pope John Paul II</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mother_Teresa" title="Mother Teresa">Mother Teresa</a>.</p><p>There was an influx of refugees due to low-cost housing in the <a href="/wiki/Sunnyslope,_Arizona" title="Sunnyslope, Arizona">Sunnyslope</a> area in the 1990s, resulting in 43 different languages being spoken in local schools by the year 2000. The new 20-story <a href="/wiki/Phoenix_City_Hall" title="Phoenix City Hall">City Hall</a> opened in 1992, and 1993 saw the creation of &quot;<a href="/wiki/Tent_city#Maricopa_County_Jail_modification" title="Tent city">Tent City</a>&quot; by Sheriff <a href="/wiki/Joe_Arpaio" title="Joe Arpaio">Joe Arpaio</a>, using inmate labor, to alleviate overcrowding in the Maricopa County Jail system, the fourth-largest in the world. The famous &quot;<a href="/wiki/Phoenix_Lights" title="Phoenix Lights">Phoenix Lights</a>&quot; <a href="/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object" title="Unidentified flying object">UFO</a> sightings took place in March 1997.</p><p>Phoenix has maintained a growth streak in recent years, growing by 24.2% before 2007. This made it the second-fastest-growing metropolitan area in the United States, surpassed only by <a href="/wiki/Las_Vegas_metropolitan_area" class="mw-redirect" title="Las Vegas metropolitan area">Las Vegas</a>. In 2008, Squaw Peak, the second tallest mountain in the city, was renamed <a href="/wiki/Piestewa_Peak" title="Piestewa Peak">Piestewa Peak</a> after Army Specialist <a href="/wiki/Lori_Ann_Piestewa" class="mw-redirect" title="Lori Ann Piestewa">Lori Ann Piestewa</a>, an Arizonan and the first <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" title="Indigenous peoples of the Americas">Native American</a> woman to die in combat while serving in the U.S. military, as well as being the first American female casualty of the <a href="/wiki/Iraq_War" title="Iraq War">2003 Iraq War</a>. 2008 also saw Phoenix as one of the cities hardest hit by the <a href="/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis" title="Subprime mortgage crisis">subprime mortgage crisis</a>, and by early 2009 the median home price was $150,000, down from its $262,000 peak in 2007. Crime rates in Phoenix have gone down in recent years, and once troubled, decaying neighborhoods such as <a href="/wiki/South_Phoenix" title="South Phoenix">South Mountain</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alhambra,_Phoenix,_Arizona" class="mw-redirect" title="Alhambra, Phoenix, Arizona">Alhambra</a>, and <a href="/wiki/West_Phoenix" class="mw-redirect" title="West Phoenix">Maryvale</a> have recovered and stabilized. Recently, downtown Phoenix and the central core have experienced renewed interest and growth, resulting in numerous restaurants, stores, and businesses opening or relocating to central Phoenix.</p><p>Phoenix is in the southwestern United States, in the south-central portion of Arizona, and about halfway between <a href="/wiki/Tucson,_Arizona" title="Tucson, Arizona">Tucson</a> to the south and <a href="/wiki/Flagstaff,_Arizona" title="Flagstaff, Arizona">Flagstaff</a> to the north. The metropolitan area is known as the &quot;Valley of the Sun&quot;, due to its location in the Salt River Valley. It lies at a mean elevation of 1,086 feet (331&#xA0;m), in the northern reaches of the Sonoran Desert.</p><p>Other than the mountains in and around the city, the topography of Phoenix is generally flat, allowing the city&apos;s main streets to run on a precise grid with wide, open-spaced roadways. Scattered, low mountain ranges surround the valley: <a href="/wiki/McDowell_Mountains" title="McDowell Mountains">McDowell Mountains</a> to the northeast, the <a href="/wiki/White_Tank_Mountains" title="White Tank Mountains">White Tank Mountains</a> to the west, the <a href="/wiki/Superstition_Mountains" title="Superstition Mountains">Superstition Mountains</a> far to the east, and the <a href="/wiki/Sierra_Estrella" title="Sierra Estrella">Sierra Estrella</a> to the southwest. On the outskirts of Phoenix are large fields of irrigated cropland and several Indian reservations. The Salt River runs westward through the city of Phoenix, and the riverbed is often dry or contains a little water due to large irrigation diversions. The community of <a href="/wiki/Ahwatukee" class="mw-redirect" title="Ahwatukee">Ahwatukee</a> is separated from the rest of the city by South Mountain.</p><p>According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 517.9 square miles (1,341&#xA0;km2); 516.7 square miles (1,338&#xA0;km2) of it is land and 1.2 square miles (0.6&#xA0;km&#xB2;, or 0.2%) of it is water. Even though it is the 6th most populated city, the large area gives it a low density rate of approximately 2,797 people per square mile. In comparison, Philadelphia, the 5th most populous city has a density of over 11,000.</p><p>As with most of Arizona, Phoenix does not observe <a href="/wiki/Daylight_saving_time" title="Daylight saving time">daylight saving time</a>. In 1973, Gov. Jack Williams argued to the U.S. Congress that due to air conditioning units not being used as often in the morning on standard time, energy use would increase in the evening. He went on to say that energy use would rise &quot;because there would be more lights on in the early morning.&quot; He was also concerned that daylight savings time would cause children to go to school in the dark.</p><p>Since 1979, the City of Phoenix has been divided into <a href="/wiki/Urban_village" title="Urban village">urban villages</a>, many of which are based upon historically significant neighborhoods and communities that have since been annexed into Phoenix. Each village has a planning committee that is appointed directly by the city council. According to the village planning handbook issued by the city, the purpose of the village planning committees is to &quot;work with the city&apos;s planning commission to ensure a balance of housing and employment in each village, concentrate development at identified village cores, and to promote the unique character and identity of the villages.&quot; There are 15 urban villages: Ahwatukee Foothills, Alhambra, <a href="/wiki/Camelback_East,_Phoenix" title="Camelback East, Phoenix">Camelback East</a>, <a href="/wiki/Central_City,_Phoenix" title="Central City, Phoenix">Central City</a>, Deer Valley, Desert View, <a href="/wiki/Encanto,_Phoenix" title="Encanto, Phoenix">Encanto</a>, Estrella, <a href="/wiki/Laveen,_Arizona" title="Laveen, Arizona">Laveen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Maryvale_(Phoenix)" title="Maryvale (Phoenix)">Maryvale</a>, North Gateway, North Mountain, Paradise Valley, <a href="/wiki/Rio_Vista,_Phoenix" title="Rio Vista, Phoenix">Rio Vista</a>, and South Mountain.</p><p>The urban village of Paradise Valley is different than the nearby town of Paradise Valley.

Phoenix has long, very hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate is arid, with plenty of sunshine and clear skies. Average high temperatures in summer are the hottest of any major city in the United States, and the city has more days when the temperature exceeds 100&#xA0;&#xB0;F (38&#xA0;&#xB0;C) than any other city in the United States. On average (1981&#x2013;2010), there were 107 days annually with a high of at least 100&#xA0;&#xB0;F (38&#xA0;&#xB0;C), including most days from late May through early October. Highs top 110&#xA0;&#xB0;F (43&#xA0;&#xB0;C) an average of 18 days during the year. Every day from June 10 through August 24, 1993, the temperature in Phoenix reached 100&#xA0;&#xB0;F (38&#xA0;&#xB0;C) or more, the longest continuous number of days (76) in the city&apos;s history. Officially, the number of days with a high of at least 100&#xA0;&#xB0;F (38&#xA0;&#xB0;C) has historically ranged from 48 in 1913 to 143 in 1989. For comparison, From 1870 through 2012, New York City has seen a temperature of 100&#xA0;&#xB0;F (38&#xA0;&#xB0;C) or more a total of only 61 days. On June 26, 1990, the temperature reached an all-time recorded high of 122&#xA0;&#xB0;F (50&#xA0;&#xB0;C). However, despite Phoenix&apos;s claim to the most extreme temperatures, it does not have the highest average temperature. In that respect it comes in second to <a href="/wiki/Miami" title="Miami">Miami</a>, with an average daily temperature of 75&#xA0;&#xB0;F (24&#xA0;&#xB0;C), compared to Miami&apos;s 77&#xA0;&#xB0;F (25&#xA0;&#xB0;C).</p><p>Most deserts undergo drastic fluctuations between day and nighttime temperatures, but not Phoenix due to the <a href="/wiki/Urban_heat_island" title="Urban heat island">urban heat island</a> effect. As the city has expanded, average summer low temps have been rising steadily. The daily heat of the sun is stored in pavement, sidewalks and buildings, and is radiated back out at night. During the summer, overnight lows greater than 80&#xA0;&#xB0;F (27&#xA0;&#xB0;C) are commonplace, as the daily normal low remains at or above 80&#xA0;&#xB0;F (27&#xA0;&#xB0;C) from June 22 to September 8. On average, 67 days throughout the year will see the nighttime low at or above 80&#xA0;&#xB0;F (27&#xA0;&#xB0;C). On July 15, 2003 Phoenix set their record for the warmest minimum daily temperature, at 96&#xA0;&#xB0;F (36&#xA0;&#xB0;C).</p><p>The city averages approximately 300 days of sunshine, or over 85% of daylight hours per year, and receives scant rainfall, the average annual total at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport from 1933&#x2013;2015 being 7.46&#xA0;in (189&#xA0;mm). Precipitation is sparse during most of the year, but the monsoon brings an influx of moisture. Historically, the monsoon officially started when the average Dew point was 55&#xA0;&#xB0;F (13&#xA0;&#xB0;C) for three days in a row; on average this event occurred around July 7; however, in 2008 the National Weather Service decreed that from that point forward, June 15 would be the official first day of the monsoon, and it would end on September 30. The monsoon raises humidity levels and can cause heavy localized precipitation, occasional flooding, large hail, strong winds, the rare tornado, and <a href="/wiki/Dust_storm#Dust_storm_visibility_of_.C2.BC_mile_or_less.2C_or_meters_or_less" title="Dust storm">dust storms</a>, which can rise to the level of a <a href="/wiki/Haboob" title="Haboob">haboob</a> in some years.</p><p>July is the wettest month of the year (1.05&#xA0;in (27&#xA0;mm)), while June is the driest (0.02&#xA0;in (0.51&#xA0;mm)). On September 8, 2014, the city of Phoenix recorded its single highest rainfall total by the National Weather Service with a total of 3.30&#xA0;in (84&#xA0;mm). This total rainfall on this day measured more than Phoenix&apos;s annual rainfall average and broke a 75-year-old previous record of 2.91&#xA0;in (74&#xA0;mm), set back on September 4, 1939. This storm was created from the remnants of Hurricane Norbert that had moved up from the Gulf of California and turned the city&apos;s major interstates and low-lying roadways into flood plains, stranding hundreds of motorists. Dewpoints range from 39.0&#xA0;&#xB0;F (4&#xA0;&#xB0;C) in June to 58.2&#xA0;&#xB0;F (15&#xA0;&#xB0;C) in August.</p><p>On average, Phoenix has only one day per year where the temperature drops to or below freezing. However, the frequency of freezes increases the further one moves outward from the urban heat island. Frequently, outlying areas of Phoenix see frost. Officially, the earliest freeze on record occurred on November 4, 1956, and the latest occurred on March 31, 1987. The all-time lowest recorded temperature in Phoenix was 16&#xA0;&#xB0;F (&#x2212;9&#xA0;&#xB0;C) on January 7, 1913, while the coldest daily high temperature ever recorded was 36&#xA0;&#xB0;F (2&#xA0;&#xB0;C) on December 10, 1898. The longest continuous stretch without a day of frost in Phoenix was over 5 years, from November 23, 1979, to January 31, 1985. Snow is a very rare occurrence for the city of Phoenix. Snowfall was first officially recorded in 1898, and since then, accumulations of 0.1 inches (0.25&#xA0;cm) or greater have occurred only eight times. The heaviest snowstorm on record dates to January 21&#x2013;22, 1937, when 1 to 4 inches (2.5 to 10.2&#xA0;cm) fell in parts of the city and did not melt entirely for three days. The most recent snow of significance fell on December 6, 1998, across the northwest portions of the valley that are below 2,000 feet. During the 1998 event, Sky Harbor reported a dusting of snow. On December 30, 2010 and February 20, 2013, <a href="/wiki/Graupel" title="Graupel">graupel</a> fell, although it was widely believed to be snow.</p><p><br></p><p>Due to its location in the Sonoran Desert, nearly all of the native desert fauna are occasionally found within Phoenix boundaries, but mostly in the suburbs and the remaining desert areas around the city.

Phoenix&apos;s ranking as the sixth most populous city was a drop from the number five position it had held since the U. S. Census Bureau released population estimates on June 28, 2007. Those statistics used data from 2006, which showed Phoenix&apos;s population at 1,512,986, which put it just ahead of Philadelphia.</p><p>After leading the nation in population growth for over a decade, the sub-prime mortgage crisis, followed by the recession, led to a slowing in the growth of Phoenix. There were approximately 77,000 people added to the population of the Phoenix metropolitan area in 2009, which was down significantly from its peak in 2006 of 162,000. Despite this slowing, Phoenix&apos;s population grew by 9.4% since the 2000 census (a total of 124,000 people), while the entire Phoenix metropolitan area grew by 28.9% during the same period. This compares with an overall growth rate nationally during the same time frame of 9.7%. Not since 1940&#x2013;50, when the city had a population of 107,000, had the city gained less than 124,000 in a decade. Phoenix&apos;s recent growth rate of 9.4% from the 2010 census is the first time it has recorded a growth rate under 24% in a census decade.</p><p>The Phoenix <a href="/wiki/Metropolitan_statistical_area" title="Metropolitan statistical area">Metropolitan Statistical Area</a> (MSA) (officially known as the Phoenix-Mesa-Glendale MSA), is one of 10 MSAs in Arizona, and was the 14th largest in the United States, with a total population of 4,192,887 as of the 2010 Census. Consisting of parts of both Pinal and Maricopa counties, the MSA accounts for 65.5% of the total population of the state of Arizona. Phoenix only contributed 13% to the total growth rate of the MSA, down significantly from its 33% share during the prior decade.

The population density is 2,797.8 people per square mile, and the median age of the city is 32.2 years, with only 10.9 of the population being over 62. 98.5% of Phoenix&apos;s population lives in households with an average household size of 2.77 people. There were 514,806 total households, with 64.2% of those households consisting of families: 42.3% married couples, 7% with an unmarried male as head of household, and 14.9% with an unmarried female as head of household. 33.6% of those households have children below the age of 18. Of the 35.8% of non-family households, 27.1% of them have a householder living alone, almost evenly split between men and women, with women having 13.7% and men occupying 13.5%. Phoenix has 590,149 housing units, with an occupancy rate of 87.2%. The largest segment of vacancies is in the rental market, where the vacancy rate is 14.9%, and 51% of all vacancies are in rentals. Vacant houses for sale only make up 17.7% of the vacancies, with the rest being split among vacation properties and other various reasons.</p><p>The median income for a household in the city was $47,866, and the median income for a family was $54,804. Males had a median income of $32,820 versus $27,466 for females. The per capita income for the city was $24,110. 21.8% of the population and 17.1% of families were below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 31.4% of those under the age of 18 and 10.5% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.</p><p>According to the 2010 Census, the racial breakdown of Phoenix was as follows:</p><p>Phoenix&apos;s population has historically been predominantly white. From 1890 to 1970, over 90% of the citizens were white. In recent years, this percentage has dropped, reaching 65% In 2010.

Of the 1,342,803 residents over 5 years of age, 63.5% spoke only English, 30.6% spoke Spanish at home, 2.5% spoke another Indo-European language, 2.1% spoke Asian or Islander languages, with the remaining 1.4% speaking other languages. About 15.7% of non-English speakers reported speaking English less than &quot;very well&quot;.

While there was an overall increase in the number of religious adherents over the decade of 103,000, that did not keep pace with the overall population increase in the country during the same period, which increased by almost three-quarters of million individuals, resulting in the percentage drop. The largest aggregate increases were in the LDS (a 58% increase) and Evangelical Protestant churches (14% increase), while all other categories saw their numbers drop slightly, or remain static. Overall, the Catholic Church had an 8% drop, while Mainline Protestant groups saw a 28% decline.</p><p>The early economy of Phoenix was focused primarily on agriculture and natural resources, dependent on the &quot;5Cs&quot; of copper, cattle, climate, cotton, and citrus. With the establishment of the Southern Pacific rail line in 1926, the opening of the Union Station in 1923, and the creation of Sky Harbor airport by the end of the decade, the city became more easily accessible. The Great Depression affected Phoenix, but Phoenix had a diverse economy and by 1934 the recovery was underway. At the conclusion of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the valley&apos;s economy surged, as many men who had undergone their military training at the various bases in and around Phoenix returned with their families. The construction industry, spurred on by the city&apos;s growth, further expanded with the development of <a href="/wiki/Sun_City,_Arizona" title="Sun City, Arizona">Sun City</a>. It became the template for suburban development in post-WWII America, and Sun City became the template for retirement communities when it opened in 1960. The city averaged a 4 percent annual growth rate over a 40-year period from the mid-1960s to the mid-2000s.</p><p>As the national financial crisis of 2007&#x2013;10 began, construction in Phoenix collapsed and housing prices plunged. Arizona jobs declined by 11.8% from peak to trough; in 2007 Phoenix had 1,918,100 employed individuals, by 2010 that number had shrunk by 226,500 to 1,691,600. By the end of 2015, the employment number in Phoenix had risen to 1.97 million, finally regaining its pre-<a href="/wiki/Great_Recession" title="Great Recession">recession</a> levels, with job growth occurring across the board.</p><p>As of 2014, the Phoenix MSA had a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of just over $215 billion.

It is named in honor of retired U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O&apos;Connor, who was raised in Arizona.</p><p>The Federal Building is at the intersection of Van Buren Road and First Avenue downtown, and contains various federal field offices and the local division of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. This building formerly housed the U.S. District Court offices and courtrooms, but these were moved in 2001 to the new Sandra Day O&apos;Connor U.S. Courthouse.

It was during this time frame when an incident occurred in Phoenix which would have national implications. On March 16, 1963, <a href="/wiki/Ernesto_Miranda" title="Ernesto Miranda">Ernesto Miranda</a> was arrested and charged with rape. The subsequent Supreme Court ruling on June 13, 1966, Miranda v. Arizona, has led to practice in the United States of issuing a <i>Miranda Warning</i> to all suspected criminals.</p><p>With Phoenix&apos;s rapid growth, one of the prime areas of criminal activity was land fraud. The practice became so widespread that newspapers would refer to Phoenix as <i>the Tainted Desert</i>. These land frauds led to one of the more infamous murders in the history of the valley, when <i>Arizona Republic</i> writer <a href="/wiki/Don_Bolles" title="Don Bolles">Don Bolles</a> was murdered by a car bomb in 1976. It was believed that his investigative reporting on organized crime and land fraud in Phoenix made him a target. Bolles was the only reporter from a major U.S. newspaper to be murdered on U.S. soil due to his coverage of a story. Max Dunlap was convicted of first-degree murder in the case.</p><p>Street gangs and the drug trade had turned into public safety issues by the 1980s, and the crime rate in Phoenix continued to grow. After seeing a peak in the early and mid-1990s, the city has seen a general decrease in crime rates. The Maricopa County Jail system is the fourth-largest in the world. The violent crime rate peaked in 1993 at 1146 crimes per 100,000 people, while the property crime rate peaked a few years earlier, in 1989, at 9,966 crimes per 100,000.</p><p>In the most recent numbers from the FBI (2012), those rates currently stand at 637 and 4091, respectively. Since their peak in 2003, murders have dropped from 241 to 114 in 2014.</p><p>In 2001 and 2002 Phoenix ranked first in the nation in vehicle thefts, with over 22,000 and 25,000 cars stolen each year respectively. It has declined every year since then, stood at 7200 in 2014, a drop of almost 70% during that timeframe. The Phoenix MSA has dropped to 70th in the nation in terms of car thefts in 2012.</p><p>As the first decade of the new century came to a close, Arizona had become the gateway to the U.S. for drug trafficking. Another crime issue related to the drug trade are kidnappings. In the late 2000s, Phoenix earned the title &quot;Kidnapping capital of the USA&quot;. The majority of the kidnapped are believed to be victims of human smuggling, or related to illegal drug trade, while the kidnappers are believed to be part of <a href="/wiki/Mexican_Drug_War" title="Mexican Drug War">Mexican drug cartels</a>.</p><p>Public education in the Phoenix area is provided by 33 school districts. There are 21 elementary school districts, which contain over 215 elementary schools, and they are paired with 4 high school districts, which have a total of 31 high schools serving Phoenix.

Freeways fall under the auspices of the <a href="/wiki/Arizona_Department_of_Transportation" title="Arizona Department of Transportation">Arizona Department of Transportation</a> (ADOT). Phoenix ranks first in the nation in the quality of its urban freeways, and the state as a whole ranks first in the nation in the quality of bridges. While being the sixth most populous city in the nation, Phoenix&apos;s freeways do not suffer from the same type of congestion seen in other large cities. In fact, in a recent study, there is not a single stretch of freeway in Phoenix ranked in the 100 worst freeways for either congestion or unreliability.</p><p>Part of the reason for this is the extensive freeway system in the city, due to the majority of that system being funded by local, rather than federal funds, through a &#xBD; cent general sales tax measure approved by voters in 1985. Another offshoot of this local funding is that Phoenix is the largest city in the United States to have two Interstate Highways and no 3-digit interstates.</p><p>As of 2005, the metropolitan area of Phoenix contains one of the nation&apos;s largest and fastest growing freeway systems, consisting of over 1,405 lane miles.

The original plan was for the east-west streets to be named after presidents, with the north-south streets named after Indians, however the north-south streets were quickly changed to numbers, with avenues running to the west of Central, and streets to its east. Major arterial streets are spaced one mile (1.6&#xA0;km) apart, divided into smaller blocks approximately every &#x215B; of a mile. For example, Scottsdale Road, being the 7200 block, lies 9 miles to the east of Central Avenue (72 / 8).</p><p>Freeways and state highways in Phoenix:</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Maricopa_Association_of_Governments" title="Maricopa Association of Governments">Maricopa Association of Governments</a> has a bicycle advisory committee working to improve conditions for bicycling on city streets and off-road paths.

The main sources of electrical generation are nuclear, and coal power plants. Arizona is home to the Palo Verde Nuclear Power Station, the largest nuclear-generating facility in the United States. SRP is also the largest water provider in Phoenix.</p><p>In 2011 (the last year for which information is available), Phoenix had a slightly younger population than the country as a whole. While the United States had 13.3% of its population over the age of 65, Phoenix&apos;s percentage stood significantly lower, at 8.1%. Phoenix&apos;s percentage of 18.8% in the next age group, 45&#x2013;64 was also a great deal lower than the national average of 26.6%. This results in 73% of Phoenix&apos;s population being 44 or younger, as compared to the national percentage of 60.</p><p>In 2010 (the last year for nationally reported figures), Phoenix was at or below national levels for most reportable diseases, with the exception of both hepatitis A and B, where they were slightly over the national average (0.8 and 1.8 to 0.5 and 1.1%, respectively).</p><p>In most major categories, Phoenix had a lower incidence of death than the rest of the nation. Only deaths due to Alzheimer&apos;s (29.7 to 27.2 deaths per 100,000) and pre-natal conditions (5.3 to 3.8 deaths per 100,000) were slightly above the national average. Deaths due to HIV and liver disease were exactly at the national average of 2.5 and 10.8 respectively. However, in several major categories, Phoenix had significantly lower indices of death: deaths by cancer stood at only 57% (106) of the national average of 184.6 deaths per 100,000; deaths due to heart disease, 56.1% of the national rate of 249.8 per 100,000. Cancer and heart disease were the two top causes of death in the country.</p><p>Low-weight births (7.5%) were below the national average of 8.1%, yet infant mortality (7.2%) was higher than the rest of the U.S. (6.1%). Births to teen mothers were significantly higher than the rest of the country, sitting at 12.2% as compared to 8.4% nationally.</p><p>The Phoenix metropolitan area is serviced by 56 hospitals and medical centers.
