They established the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (renamed <a href="/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic" title="Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic">Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic</a> in 1936), beginning a <a href="/wiki/Russian_Civil_War" title="Russian Civil War">civil war</a> between the revolutionary &quot;Reds&quot; and the counter-revolutionary &quot;Whites.&quot; The <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" title="Red Army">Red Army</a> entered several territories of the former <a href="/wiki/Russian_Empire" title="Russian Empire">Russian Empire</a> and helped local Communists take power through <a href="/wiki/Soviet_(council)" title="Soviet (council)">soviets</a>, which nominally acted on behalf of workers and peasants.

The <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> emerged in 1947 as the Soviet bloc confronted the Western states that united in the <a href="/wiki/NATO" title="NATO">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> in 1949.</p><p>Following Stalin&apos;s death in 1953, a period of political and economic liberalization, known as &quot;<a href="/wiki/De-Stalinization" title="De-Stalinization">de-Stalinization</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="/wiki/Khrushchev_Thaw" title="Khrushchev Thaw">Khrushchev&apos;s Thaw</a>&quot;, occurred under the leadership of <a href="/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev" title="Nikita Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a>.

The goal was to preserve the Communist Party while reversing <a href="/wiki/Era_of_Stagnation" title="Era of Stagnation">economic stagnation</a>. The Cold War ended during his tenure, and in 1989 Soviet satellite countries in Eastern Europe overthrew their respective communist regimes. This led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements inside the USSR as well.

In 1933, diplomatic relations between the United States and the USSR were established when in November, the newly elected President of the United States, Franklin D.

Fearing its ambitions, the Soviet Union&apos;s wartime allies, the United Kingdom and the United States, became its enemies. In the ensuing Cold War, the two sides clashed indirectly using mostly proxies.</p><p>Stalin died on 5 March 1953. Without a mutually agreeable successor, the highest Communist Party officials initially opted to rule the Soviet Union jointly through a troika. This did not last, however, and <a href="/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev" title="Nikita Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a> eventually won the power struggle by the mid-1950s. He shortly aftwerward <a href="/wiki/On_the_Cult_of_Personality_and_Its_Consequences" title="On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences">denounced Stalin&apos;s use of repression</a> in 1956 and proceeded to ease Stalin&apos;s repressive controls over party and society. This was known as <a href="/wiki/De-Stalinization" title="De-Stalinization">de-Stalinization</a>.</p><p>Because Moscow considered Eastern Europe to be a critically vital buffer zone for the forward defense of its western borders (in case of another major invasion such as the German invasion of 1940), the USSR sought to cement its control of the region by transforming the Eastern European countries into satellite states dependent upon and subservient to its leadership. Soviet military force was used to suppress anti-Stalinist uprisings in <a href="/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956" title="Hungarian Revolution of 1956">Hungary</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pozna%C5%84_1956_protests" title="Pozna&#x144; 1956 protests">Poland</a> in 1956.</p><p>In the late 1950s, a confrontation with China regarding the USSR&apos;s rapprochement with the West and what <a href="/wiki/Mao_Zedong" title="Mao Zedong">Mao Zedong</a> perceived as Khrushchev&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Revisionism_(Marxism)" title="Revisionism (Marxism)">revisionism</a> led to the <a href="/wiki/Sino%E2%80%93Soviet_split" class="mw-redirect" title="Sino&#x2013;Soviet split">Sino&#x2013;Soviet split</a>.

This included some openness and contact with other nations and new social and economic policies with more emphasis on commodity goods, allowing living standards to rise dramatically while maintaining high levels of economic growth. Censorship was relaxed as well.</p><p>Khrushchev&apos;s reforms in agriculture and administration, however, were generally unproductive. In 1962, he precipitated a <a href="/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis" title="Cuban Missile Crisis">crisis with the United States</a> over the Soviet deployment of <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_delivery" title="Nuclear weapons delivery">nuclear missiles</a> in <a href="/wiki/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>. An agreement was made between the Soviet Union and the United States to remove enemy nuclear missiles from both Cuba and <a href="/wiki/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, concluding the crisis. This event caused Khrushchev much embarrassment and loss of prestige, resulting in his removal from power in 1964.</p><p>Following the ousting of Khrushchev, another period of <a href="/wiki/Collective_leadership" title="Collective leadership">collective leadership</a> ensued, consisting of <a href="/wiki/Leonid_Brezhnev" title="Leonid Brezhnev">Leonid Brezhnev</a> as General Secretary, <a href="/wiki/Alexei_Kosygin" title="Alexei Kosygin">Alexei Kosygin</a> as Premier and <a href="/wiki/Nikolai_Podgorny" title="Nikolai Podgorny">Nikolai Podgorny</a> as Chairman of the Presidium, lasting until Brezhnev established himself in the early 1970s as the preeminent Soviet leader.</p><p>In 1968, the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact allies <a href="/wiki/Warsaw_Pact_invasion_of_Czechoslovakia" title="Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia">invaded</a> <a href="/wiki/Czechoslovakia" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> to halt the <a href="/wiki/Prague_Spring" title="Prague Spring">Prague Spring</a> reforms. In the aftermath, Brezhnev justified the invasion along with the earlier invasions of Eastern European states by introducing the <a href="/wiki/Brezhnev_Doctrine" title="Brezhnev Doctrine">Brezhnev Doctrine</a>, which claimed the right of the Soviet Union to violate the sovereignty of any country that attempted to replace Marxism&#x2013;Leninism with capitalism.</p><p>Brezhnev presided over a period of <i><a href="/wiki/D%C3%A9tente" title="D&#xE9;tente">d&#xE9;tente</a></i> with the West that resulted in treaties on armament control (<a href="/wiki/Strategic_Arms_Limitation_Talks#SALT_I_Treaty" title="Strategic Arms Limitation Talks">SALT I</a>, <a href="/wiki/Strategic_Arms_Limitation_Talks#SALT_II" title="Strategic Arms Limitation Talks">SALT II</a>, <a href="/wiki/Anti-Ballistic_Missile_Treaty" title="Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty">Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty</a>) while at the same time building up Soviet military might.</p><p>In October 1977, the <a href="/wiki/1977_Soviet_Constitution" title="1977 Soviet Constitution">third Soviet Constitution</a> was unanimously adopted. The prevailing mood of the Soviet leadership at the time of Brezhnev&apos;s death in 1982 was one of aversion to change. The long period of Brezhnev&apos;s rule had come to be dubbed one of &quot;standstill&quot;, with an aging and ossified top political leadership.</p><p>Two developments dominated the decade that followed: the increasingly apparent crumbling of the Soviet Union&apos;s economic and political structures, and the patchwork attempts at reforms to reverse that process. Kenneth S. Deffeyes argued in <i><a href="/wiki/Beyond_Oil" title="Beyond Oil">Beyond Oil</a></i> that the <a href="/wiki/Presidency_of_Ronald_Reagan" title="Presidency of Ronald Reagan">Reagan administration</a> encouraged <a href="/wiki/Saudi_Arabia" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> to <a href="/wiki/1980s_oil_glut" title="1980s oil glut">lower the price of oil</a> to the point where the Soviets could not make a profit selling their oil, so that the USSR&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Hard_currency" title="Hard currency">hard currency</a> reserves became depleted.</p><p>Brezhnev&apos;s next two successors, transitional figures with deep roots in his tradition, did not last long. <a href="/wiki/Yuri_Andropov" title="Yuri Andropov">Yuri Andropov</a> was 68 years old and <a href="/wiki/Konstantin_Chernenko" title="Konstantin Chernenko">Konstantin Chernenko</a> 72 when they assumed power; both died in less than two years. In an attempt to avoid a third short-lived leader, in 1985, the Soviets turned to the next generation and selected <a href="/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev" title="Mikhail Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>.</p><p>Gorbachev made significant changes in the economy and party leadership, called <i><a href="/wiki/Perestroika" title="Perestroika">perestroika</a></i>. His policy of <i><a href="/wiki/Glasnost" title="Glasnost">glasnost</a></i> freed public access to information after decades of heavy government censorship.</p><p>Gorbachev also moved to end the Cold War. In 1988, the Soviet Union abandoned its <a href="/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan_War" title="Soviet&#x2013;Afghan War">nine-year war in Afghanistan</a> and began to withdraw its forces. In the late 1980s, <span class="clarify-content" style="padding-left:0.1em; padding-right:0.1em; color:#595959; border:1px solid #DDD;">he refused military support to the Soviet Union&apos;s former satellite states</span>, which paved the way for <a href="/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989" title="Revolutions of 1989">Revolutions of 1989</a>. With the tearing down of the <a href="/wiki/Berlin_Wall" title="Berlin Wall">Berlin Wall</a> and with <a href="/wiki/East_Germany" title="East Germany">East Germany</a> and <a href="/wiki/West_Germany" title="West Germany">West Germany</a> pursuing unification, the <a href="/wiki/Iron_Curtain" title="Iron Curtain">Iron Curtain</a> came down.</p><p>In the late 1980s, the constituent republics of the Soviet Union started legal moves towards potentially declaring <a href="/wiki/Sovereignty" title="Sovereignty">sovereignty</a> over their territories, citing Article 72 of the USSR constitution, which stated that any constituent republic was free to secede. On 7 April 1990, a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than two-thirds of its residents voted for it in a referendum. Many held their first free elections in the Soviet era for their own national legislatures in 1990. Many of these legislatures proceeded to produce legislation contradicting the Union laws in what was known as the &quot;<a href="/wiki/War_of_Laws" title="War of Laws">War of Laws</a>&quot;.</p><p>In 1989, the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic" title="Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic">Russian SFSR</a>, which was then the largest constituent republic (with about half of the population) convened a newly elected Congress of People&apos;s Deputies. <a href="/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin" title="Boris Yeltsin">Boris Yeltsin</a> was elected its chairman. On 12 June 1990, the Congress <a href="/wiki/Declaration_of_State_Sovereignty_of_the_Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic" title="Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic">declared Russia&apos;s sovereignty over its territory</a> and proceeded to pass laws that attempted to supersede some of the USSR&apos;s laws. After a landslide victory of <a href="/wiki/S%C4%85j%C5%ABdis" title="S&#x105;j&#x16B;dis">S&#x105;j&#x16B;dis</a> in Lithuania, that country declared its independence restored on 11 March 1990.</p><p>A <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union_referendum,_1991" title="Soviet Union referendum, 1991">referendum for the preservation of the USSR</a> was held on 17 March 1991 in nine republics (the remainder having boycotted the vote), with the majority of the population in those nine republics voting for preservation of the Union. The referendum gave Gorbachev a minor boost. In the summer of 1991, the <a href="/wiki/Union_of_Sovereign_States" title="Union of Sovereign States">New Union Treaty</a>, which would have turned the Soviet Union into a much looser Union, was agreed upon by eight republics.</p><p>The signing of the treaty, however, was interrupted by the <a href="/wiki/1991_Soviet_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempt" title="1991 Soviet coup d&apos;&#xE9;tat attempt">August Coup</a>&#x2014;an attempted <a href="/wiki/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat" title="Coup d&apos;&#xE9;tat">coup d&apos;&#xE9;tat</a> by hardline members of the government and the KGB who sought to reverse Gorbachev&apos;s reforms and reassert the central government&apos;s control over the republics. After the coup collapsed, Yeltsin was seen as a hero for his decisive actions, while Gorbachev&apos;s power was effectively ended. The balance of power tipped significantly towards the republics. In August 1991, Latvia and Estonia immediately declared the restoration of their full independence (following Lithuania&apos;s 1990 example). Gorbachev resigned as general secretary in late August, and soon afterward the Party&apos;s activities were indefinitely suspended&#x2014;effectively ending its rule. By the fall, Gorbachev could no longer influence events outside of Moscow, and he was being challenged even there by Yeltsin, who had been elected <a href="/wiki/President_of_Russia" title="President of Russia">President of Russia</a> in July 1991.</p><p>The remaining 12 republics continued discussing new, increasingly looser, models of the Union. However, by December, all except Russia and <a href="/wiki/Kazakh_Soviet_Socialist_Republic" title="Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic">Kazakhstan</a> had formally declared independence. During this time, Yeltsin took over what remained of the Soviet government, including the <a href="/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin" title="Moscow Kremlin">Moscow Kremlin</a>. The final blow was struck on 1 December, when Ukraine, the second most powerful republic, <a href="/wiki/Ukrainian_independence_referendum,_1991" title="Ukrainian independence referendum, 1991">voted overwhelmingly for independence</a>. Ukraine&apos;s secession ended any realistic chance of the Soviet Union staying together even on a limited scale.</p><p>On 8 December 1991, the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and <a href="/wiki/Belarus" title="Belarus">Belarus</a> (formerly Byelorussia), signed the <a href="/wiki/Belavezha_Accords" title="Belavezha Accords">Belavezha Accords</a>, which declared the Soviet Union dissolved and established the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States" title="Commonwealth of Independent States">Commonwealth of Independent States</a> (CIS) in its place. While doubts remained over the authority of the accords to do this, on 21 December 1991, the representatives of all Soviet republics except <a href="/wiki/Georgian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic" title="Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic">Georgia</a> signed the <a href="/wiki/Alma-Ata_Protocol" title="Alma-Ata Protocol">Alma-Ata Protocol</a>, which confirmed the accords. On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev resigned as the President of the USSR, declaring the office extinct. He turned the powers that had been vested in the presidency over to Yeltsin. That night, the Soviet flag was lowered for the last time, and the <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_Russia" title="Flag of Russia">Russian tricolor</a> was raised in its place.</p><p>The following day, the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Soviet_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union">Supreme Soviet</a>, the highest governmental body of the Soviet Union, voted both itself and the Soviet Union out of existence. This is generally recognized as marking the official, final <a href="/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="Dissolution of the Soviet Union">dissolution of the Soviet Union</a> as a functioning state. The Soviet Army originally remained under overall CIS command, but was soon absorbed into the different military forces of the newly independent states. The few remaining Soviet institutions that had not been taken over by Russia ceased to function by the end of 1991.</p><p>Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991, Russia was internationally recognized as its <a href="/wiki/Succession_of_states" title="Succession of states">legal successor</a> on the international stage.

Under the 1992 <a href="/wiki/Lisbon_Protocol" title="Lisbon Protocol">Lisbon Protocol</a>, Russia also agreed to receive all nuclear weapons remaining in the territory of other former Soviet republics.

The <a href="/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russian Federation</a> is seen as the legal <i>continuator</i> state and is for most purposes the heir to the Soviet Union.

The Central Committee in turn voted for a <a href="/wiki/Politburo_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union">Politburo</a> (called the Presidium between 1952&#x2013;1966), <a href="/wiki/Secretariat_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union">Secretariat</a> and the <a href="/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union">General Secretary</a> (First Secretary from 1953 to 1966), the de facto highest office in the USSR. Depending on the degree of power consolidation, it was either the Politburo as a collective body or the General Secretary, who always was one of the Politburo members, that effectively led the party and the country (except for the period of the highly personalized authority of Stalin, exercised directly through his position in the Council of Ministers rather than the Politburo after 1941). They were not controlled by the general party membership, as the key principle of the party organization was <a href="/wiki/Democratic_centralism" title="Democratic centralism">democratic centralism</a>, demanding strict subordination to higher bodies, and elections went uncontested, endorsing the candidates proposed from above.</p><p>The Communist Party maintained its dominance over the state largely through its control over the <a href="/wiki/Nomenklatura" title="Nomenklatura">system of appointments</a>. All senior government officials and most deputies of the Supreme Soviet were members of the CPSU. Of the party heads themselves, Stalin in 1941&#x2013;1953 and Khrushchev in 1958&#x2013;1964 were Premiers. Upon the forced retirement of Khrushchev, the party leader was prohibited from this kind of double membership, but the later General Secretaries for at least some part of their tenure occupied the largely ceremonial position of <a href="/wiki/List_of_heads_of_state_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="List of heads of state of the Soviet Union">Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet</a>, the nominal <a href="/wiki/List_of_heads_of_state_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="List of heads of state of the Soviet Union">head of state</a>.

Nor was the party itself monolithic from top to bottom, although factions were officially banned.</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Soviet_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union">Supreme Soviet</a> (successor of the <a href="/wiki/Congress_of_Soviets_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union">Congress of Soviets</a> and <a href="/wiki/Central_Executive_Committee_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union">Central Executive Committee</a>) was nominally the highest state body for most of the Soviet history, at first acting as a rubber stamp institution, approving and implementing all decisions made by the party. However, the powers and functions of the Supreme Soviet were extended in the late 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, including the creation of new state commissions and committees. It gained additional powers relating to the approval of the <a href="/wiki/Five-year_plans_for_the_national_economy_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union">Five-Year Plans</a> and the Soviet <a href="/wiki/Government_budget" title="Government budget">government budget</a>. The Supreme Soviet elected a <a href="/wiki/Presidium_of_the_Supreme_Soviet" title="Presidium of the Supreme Soviet">Presidium</a> to wield its power between plenary sessions, ordinarily held twice a year, and appointed the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="Supreme Court of the Soviet Union">Supreme Court</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Procurator_General_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="Procurator General of the Soviet Union">Procurator General</a> and the Council of Ministers (known before 1946 as the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_People%27s_Commissars" title="Council of People&apos;s Commissars">Council of People&apos;s Commissars</a>), headed by the <a href="/wiki/Premier_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="Premier of the Soviet Union">Chairman</a> (Premier) and managing an enormous bureaucracy responsible for the administration of the economy and society. State and party structures of the <a href="/wiki/Republics_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="Republics of the Soviet Union">constituent republics</a> largely emulated the structure of the central institutions, although the Russian SFSR, unlike the other constituent republics, for most of its history had no republican branch of the CPSU, being ruled directly by the union-wide party until 1990. Local authorities were organized likewise into <a href="/wiki/Organization_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union#Lower_levels" title="Organization of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union">party committees</a>, <a href="/wiki/Soviet_(council)" title="Soviet (council)">local Soviets</a> and <a href="/wiki/Committee#Executive_committee" title="Committee">executive committees</a>. While the state system was nominally federal, the party was unitary.</p><p>The state security police (the <a href="/wiki/KGB" title="KGB">KGB</a> and its predecessor agencies) played an important role in Soviet politics. It was instrumental in the <a href="/wiki/Great_Purge" title="Great Purge">Stalinist terror</a>, but after the death of Stalin, the state security police was brought under strict party control. Under <a href="/wiki/Yuri_Andropov" title="Yuri Andropov">Yuri Andropov</a>, KGB chairman in 1967&#x2013;1982 and General Secretary from 1982 to 1983, the KGB engaged in the suppression of political dissent and maintained an extensive network of informers, reasserting itself as a political actor to some extent independent of the party-state structure, culminating in the anti-corruption campaign targeting high party officials in the late 1970s and early 1980s.</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="Constitution of the Soviet Union">Union constitutions</a>, which were promulgated in <a href="/wiki/Russian_Constitution_of_1918" title="Russian Constitution of 1918">1918</a>, <a href="/wiki/1924_Soviet_Constitution" title="1924 Soviet Constitution">1924</a>, <a href="/wiki/1936_Soviet_Constitution" title="1936 Soviet Constitution">1936</a> and <a href="/wiki/1977_Soviet_Constitution" title="1977 Soviet Constitution">1977</a>, did not limit state power. No formal <a href="/wiki/Separation_of_powers" title="Separation of powers">separation of powers</a> existed between the Party, Supreme Soviet and Council of Ministers that represented executive and <a href="/wiki/Legislature" title="Legislature">legislative</a> branches of the government. The system was governed less by statute than by informal conventions, and no settled mechanism of leadership succession existed.

The Congress now elected the Supreme Soviet, which became a full-time parliament, much stronger than before. For the first time since the 1920s, it refused to rubber stamp proposals from the party and Council of Ministers. In 1990, Gorbachev introduced and assumed the position of the <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="President of the Soviet Union">President of the Soviet Union</a>, concentrated power in his executive office, independent of the party, and subordinated the government, now renamed the <a href="/wiki/Cabinet_of_Ministers_(Soviet_Union)" title="Cabinet of Ministers (Soviet Union)">Cabinet of Ministers of the USSR</a>, to himself.</p><p>Tensions grew between the union-wide authorities under Gorbachev, reformists led in Russia by <a href="/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin" title="Boris Yeltsin">Boris Yeltsin</a> and controlling the newly elected <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Soviet_of_Russia" title="Supreme Soviet of Russia">Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR</a>, and Communist Party hardliners.

The first Bolshevik experience with a command economy was the policy of <a href="/wiki/War_communism" title="War communism">War communism</a>, which involved the nationalization of industry, centralized distribution of output, coercive requisition of agricultural production, and attempts to eliminate the circulation of money, as well as private enterprises and <a href="/wiki/Free_trade" title="Free trade">free trade</a>. After the severe economic collapse caused by the war, Lenin replaced War Communism with the <a href="/wiki/New_Economic_Policy" title="New Economic Policy">New Economic Policy</a> (NEP) in 1921, legalising free trade and private ownership of smaller businesses. The economy quickly recovered.</p><p>Following a lengthy debate among the members of Politburo over the course of economic development, by 1928&#x2013;1929, upon <a href="/wiki/Rise_of_Joseph_Stalin" title="Rise of Joseph Stalin">gaining control of the country</a>, <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stalin" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> abandoned the NEP and pushed for full central planning, starting <a href="/wiki/Collectivization_in_the_Soviet_Union" title="Collectivization in the Soviet Union">forced collectivization of agriculture</a> and enacting draconian labor legislation. Resources were mobilized for <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Soviet_Union_(1927%E2%80%9353)#The_Soviet_state.27s_development" title="History of the Soviet Union (1927&#x2013;53)">rapid industrialization</a>, which greatly expanded Soviet capacity in heavy industry and capital goods during the 1930s. Preparation for war was one of the main driving forces behind industrialization, mostly due to distrust of the outside capitalistic world. As a result, the USSR was transformed from a largely agrarian economy into a great industrial power, leading the way for its emergence as a superpower after <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>. During the war, the Soviet economy and infrastructure suffered massive devastation and required extensive reconstruction.</p><p>By the early 1940s, the Soviet economy had become relatively <a href="/wiki/Autarky" title="Autarky">self-sufficient</a>; for most of the period until the creation of <a href="/wiki/Comecon" title="Comecon">Comecon</a>, only a very small share of domestic products was traded internationally. After the creation of the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Bloc" title="Eastern Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a>, external trade rose rapidly. Still the influence of the <a href="/wiki/World_economy" title="World economy">world economy</a> on the USSR was limited by fixed domestic prices and a state monopoly on <a href="/wiki/Foreign_trade_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="Foreign trade of the Soviet Union">foreign trade</a>. Grain and sophisticated consumer manufactures became major import articles from around the 1960s. During the <a href="/wiki/Arms_race" title="Arms race">arms race</a> of the Cold War, the Soviet economy was burdened by military expenditures, heavily lobbied for by a powerful bureaucracy dependent on the arms industry. At the same time, the Soviet Union became the largest arms exporter to the <a href="/wiki/Third_World" title="Third World">Third World</a>. Significant amounts of Soviet resources during the Cold War were <a href="/wiki/International_relations_within_the_Comecon" title="International relations within the Comecon">allocated in aid</a> to the other <a href="/wiki/Socialist_state" title="Socialist state">socialist states</a>.</p><p>From the 1930s until its collapse in late 1991, the way the Soviet economy operated remained essentially unchanged. The economy was formally directed by <a href="/wiki/Economic_planning" title="Economic planning">central planning</a>, carried out by <a href="/wiki/Gosplan" title="Gosplan">Gosplan</a> and organized in <a href="/wiki/Five-year_plans_for_the_national_economy_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union">five-year plans</a>. In practice, however, the plans were highly aggregated and provisional, subject to <i>ad hoc</i> intervention by superiors. All key economic decisions were taken by the political leadership. Allocated resources and plan targets were normally denominated in <a href="/wiki/Soviet_ruble" title="Soviet ruble">rubles</a> rather than in physical goods. <a href="/wiki/Credit_(finance)" title="Credit (finance)">Credit</a> was discouraged, but widespread. Final allocation of output was achieved through relatively decentralized, unplanned contracting. Although in theory prices were legally set from above, in practice the actual prices were often negotiated, and informal horizontal links (between producer factories etc.) were widespread.</p><p>A number of basic <a href="/wiki/Service_(economics)" title="Service (economics)">services</a> were state-funded, such as <a href="/wiki/Education_in_the_Soviet_Union" title="Education in the Soviet Union">education</a> and healthcare. In the manufacturing sector, heavy industry and defense were assigned higher priority than the production of <a href="/wiki/Consumer_goods_in_the_Soviet_Union" title="Consumer goods in the Soviet Union">consumer goods</a>. Consumer goods, particularly outside large cities, were often scarce, of poor quality and limited choice. Under command economy, consumers had almost no influence over production, so the changing demands of a population with growing incomes could not be satisfied by supplies at rigidly fixed prices. A massive unplanned second economy grew up alongside the planned one at low levels, providing some of the goods and services that the planners could not. Legalization of some elements of the decentralized economy was attempted with the <a href="/wiki/1965_Soviet_economic_reform" title="1965 Soviet economic reform">reform of 1965</a>.</p><p>Although statistics of the Soviet economy are notoriously unreliable and its economic growth difficult to estimate precisely, by most accounts, the economy continued to expand until the mid-1980s. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet economy experienced comparatively high growth and was catching up to the West. However, after 1970, the growth, while still positive, <a href="/wiki/Era_of_Stagnation" title="Era of Stagnation">steadily declined</a> much more quickly and consistently than in other countries despite a rapid increase in the capital <a href="/wiki/Stock" title="Stock">stock</a> (the rate of increase in capital was only surpassed by Japan).</p><p>Overall, between 1960 and 1989, the growth rate of per capita income in the Soviet Union was slightly above the world average (based on 102 countries). According to <a href="/wiki/Stanley_Fischer" title="Stanley Fischer">Stanley Fischer</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_Easterly" title="William Easterly">William Easterly</a>, growth could have been faster. By their calculation, per capita income of Soviet Union in 1989 should have been twice as high as it was considering the amount of investment, education and population. The authors attribute this poor performance to low productivity of capital in the Soviet Union. Steven Rosenfielde states that the standard of living actually declined as a result of Stalin&apos;s despotism, and while there was a brief improvement following his death, lapsed into stagnation.</p><p>In 1987, <a href="/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev" title="Mikhail Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> tried to reform and revitalize the economy with his program of <i><a href="/wiki/Perestroika" title="Perestroika">perestroika</a></i>. His policies relaxed state control over enterprises, but did not yet allow it to be replaced by market incentives, ultimately resulting in a sharp decline in production output. The economy, already suffering from <a href="/wiki/1980s_oil_glut" title="1980s oil glut">reduced petroleum export revenues</a>, started to collapse. Prices were still fixed, and property was still largely state-owned until after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. For most of the period after World War II up to its collapse, the Soviet economy was <a href="/wiki/List_of_regions_by_past_GDP_(PPP)" title="List of regions by past GDP (PPP)">the second largest in the world</a> by GDP (<a href="/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity" title="Purchasing power parity">PPP</a>), and was 3rd in the world during the middle of the 1980s to 1989, though in <a href="/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita" title="List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita">per capita</a> terms the Soviet GDP was behind that of the <a href="/wiki/First_World" title="First World">First World</a> countries.</p><p>The need for fuel declined in the Soviet Union from the 1970s to the 1980s, both per ruble of gross social product and per ruble of industrial product. At the start, this decline grew very rapidly but gradually slowed down between 1970 and 1975. From 1975 and 1980, it grew even slower, only 2.6 percent. David Wilson, a historian, believed that the gas industry would account for 40 percent of Soviet fuel production by the end of the century. His theory did not come to fruition because of the USSR&apos;s collapse. The USSR, in theory, would have continued to have an economic growth rate of 2&#x2013;2.5 percent during the 1990s because of Soviet energy fields. However, the energy sector faced many difficulties, among them the country&apos;s high military expenditure and hostile relations with the <a href="/wiki/First_World" title="First World">First World</a> (pre-<a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Soviet_Union_(1982%E2%80%9391)" title="History of the Soviet Union (1982&#x2013;91)">Gorbachev era</a>).</p><p>In 1991, the Soviet Union had a <a href="/wiki/Pipeline_transport" title="Pipeline transport">pipeline</a> network of 82,000 kilometres (51,000&#xA0;mi) for <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">crude oil</a> and another 206,500 kilometres (128,300&#xA0;mi) for natural gas. Petroleum and petroleum-based products, natural gas, metals, wood, agricultural products, and a variety of manufactured goods, primarily machinery, arms and military equipment, were exported. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet Union heavily relied on fossil fuel exports to earn <a href="/wiki/Hard_currency" title="Hard currency">hard currency</a>. At its peak in 1988, it was the largest producer and second largest exporter of crude oil, surpassed only by <a href="/wiki/Saudi_Arabia" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>.</p><p>The Soviet Union placed great emphasis on <a href="/wiki/Science_and_technology_in_the_Soviet_Union" title="Science and technology in the Soviet Union">science and technology</a> within its economy, however, the most remarkable Soviet successes in technology, such as producing the <a href="/wiki/Sputnik_1" title="Sputnik 1">world&apos;s first space satellite</a>, typically were the responsibility of the military. Lenin believed that the USSR would never overtake the developed world if it remained as technologically backward as it was upon its founding. Soviet authorities proved their commitment to Lenin&apos;s belief by developing massive networks, research and development organizations. In the early 1960s, the Soviets awarded 40% of chemistry PhDs to women, compared to only 5% who received such a degree in the United States. By 1989, Soviet scientists were among the world&apos;s best-trained specialists in several areas, such as <a href="/wiki/Energy" title="Energy">energy physics</a>, selected areas of medicine, mathematics, welding and military technologies. Due to rigid state planning and <a href="/wiki/Nomenklatura" title="Nomenklatura">bureaucracy</a>, the Soviets remained far behind technologically in chemistry, biology, and computers when compared to the <a href="/wiki/First_World" title="First World">First World</a>.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Project_Socrates" title="Project Socrates">Project Socrates</a>, under the <a href="/wiki/Presidency_of_Ronald_Reagan" title="Presidency of Ronald Reagan">Reagan administration</a>, determined that the Soviet Union addressed the acquisition of science and technology in a manner that was radically different from what the US was using. In the case of the US, economic prioritization was being used for indigenous <a href="/wiki/Research_and_development" title="Research and development">research and development</a> as the means to acquire science and technology in both the private and public sectors. In contrast, the Soviet Union was offensively and defensively maneuvering in the acquisition and utilization of the worldwide technology, to increase the competitive advantage that they acquired from the technology, while preventing the US from acquiring a competitive advantage. However, in addition, the Soviet Union&apos;s technology-based planning was executed in a centralized, government-centric manner that greatly hindered its flexibility. It was this significant lack of flexibility that was exploited by the US to undermine the strength of the Soviet Union and thus foster its reform.</p><p>Transport was a key component of the nation&apos;s economy. The <a href="/wiki/First_five-year_plan_(Soviet_Union)" title="First five-year plan (Soviet Union)">economic centralization</a> of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure on a massive scale, most notably the establishment of <a href="/wiki/Aeroflot" title="Aeroflot">Aeroflot</a>, an aviation <a href="/wiki/Enterprises_in_the_Soviet_Union" title="Enterprises in the Soviet Union">enterprise</a>. The country had a wide variety of modes of transport by land, water and air. However, due to bad maintenance, much of the road, water and Soviet civil aviation transport were outdated and technologically backward compared to the First World.</p><p>Soviet rail transport was the largest and most intensively used in the world; it was also better developed than most of its Western counterparts. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the burden from the railways and to improve the Soviet <a href="/wiki/Government_budget" title="Government budget">government budget</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Street_network" title="Street network">street network</a> and <a href="/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_the_Soviet_Union" title="Automotive industry in the Soviet Union">automotive industry</a> remained underdeveloped, and <a href="/wiki/Dirt_road" title="Dirt road">dirt roads</a> were common outside major cities. Soviet maintenance projects proved unable to take care of even the few roads the country had. By the early-to-mid-1980s, the Soviet authorities tried to solve the road problem by ordering the construction of new ones. Meanwhile, the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than road construction. The underdeveloped road network led to a growing demand for public transport.</p><p>Despite improvements, several aspects of the transport sector were still riddled with problems due to outdated infrastructure, lack of investment, corruption and bad decision-making. Soviet authorities were unable to meet the growing demand for transport infrastructure and services.</p><p>The Soviet <a href="/wiki/Merchant_navy" title="Merchant navy">merchant navy</a> was one of the largest in the world.</p><p>Excess deaths over the course of <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Civil_War" title="Russian Civil War">Russian Civil War</a> (including the postwar <a href="/wiki/Russian_famine_of_1921" class="mw-redirect" title="Russian famine of 1921">famine</a>) amounted to a combined total of 18 million, some 10 million in the 1930s, and more than 26 million in 1941&#x2013;5. The postwar <a href="/wiki/Demographics_of_the_Soviet_Union#Population" title="Demographics of the Soviet Union">Soviet population</a> was 45 to 50 million smaller than it would have been if pre-war demographic growth had continued. According to <a href="/wiki/Catherine_Merridale" title="Catherine Merridale">Catherine Merridale</a>, &quot;... reasonable estimate would place the total number of excess deaths for the whole period somewhere around 60 million.&quot;</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Birth_rate" title="Birth rate">birth rate</a> of the USSR decreased from 44.0 per thousand in 1926 to 18.0 in 1974, largely due to increasing urbanization and the rising average age of marriages. The <a href="/wiki/Mortality_rate" title="Mortality rate">mortality rate</a> demonstrated a gradual decrease as well &#x2013; from 23.7 per thousand in 1926 to 8.7 in 1974. In general, the birth rates of the southern republics in Transcaucasia and Central Asia were considerably higher than those in the northern parts of the Soviet Union, and in some cases even increased in the post&#x2013;World War II period, a phenomenon partly attributed to slower rates of urbanization and traditionally earlier marriages in the southern republics. Soviet Europe moved towards <a href="/wiki/Sub-replacement_fertility" title="Sub-replacement fertility">sub-replacement fertility</a>, while <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Central_Asia" title="Soviet Central Asia">Soviet Central Asia</a> continued to exhibit population growth well above replacement-level fertility.</p><p>The late 1960s and the 1970s witnessed a reversal of the declining trajectory of the rate of mortality in the USSR, and was especially notable among men of working age, but was also prevalent in Russia and other predominantly Slavic areas of the country. An analysis of the official data from the late 1980s showed that after worsening in the late-1970s and the early 1980s, adult mortality began to improve again. The infant mortality rate increased from 24.7 in 1970 to 27.9 in 1974. Some researchers regarded the rise as largely real, a consequence of worsening health conditions and services. The rises in both adult and infant mortality were not explained or defended by Soviet officials, and the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="Government of the Soviet Union">Soviet government</a> simply stopped publishing all mortality statistics for ten years. Soviet demographers and health specialists remained silent about the mortality increases until the late-1980s, when the publication of mortality data resumed and researchers could delve into the real causes.</p><p>Before 1917, education was not free in the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Empire" title="Russian Empire">Russian Empire</a> and was therefore either inaccessible or barely accessible for many children from lower-class working and peasant families. Estimates from 1917 recorded that 75&#x2013;85 percent of the Russian population was <a href="/wiki/Literacy" title="Literacy">illiterate</a>.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Anatoly_Lunacharsky" title="Anatoly Lunacharsky">Anatoly Lunacharsky</a> became the first <a href="/wiki/Commissar#People.27s_Commissar" title="Commissar">People&apos;s Commissar</a> for Education of Soviet Russia. At the beginning, the Soviet authorities placed great emphasis on the elimination of illiteracy. People who were <a href="/wiki/Literacy" title="Literacy">literate</a> were automatically hired as teachers. For a short period, quality was sacrificed for quantity. By 1940, Joseph Stalin could announce that illiteracy had been eliminated. Throughout the 1930s <a href="/wiki/Social_mobility" title="Social mobility">social mobility</a> rose sharply, which has been attributed to Soviet reforms in education. In the aftermath of the Great Patriotic War, the country&apos;s educational system expanded dramatically. This expansion had a tremendous effect. In the 1960s, nearly all Soviet children had access to education, the only exception being those living in remote areas. <a href="/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev" title="Nikita Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a> tried to make education more accessible, making it clear to children that education was closely linked to the needs of society. Education also became important in giving rise to the <a href="/wiki/New_Soviet_man" title="New Soviet man">New Man</a>. Citizens directly entering the work force had the constitutional right to a job and to free <a href="/wiki/Vocational-technical_school" title="Vocational-technical school">vocational training</a>.</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Education_in_the_Soviet_Union" title="Education in the Soviet Union">country&apos;s system of education</a> was highly centralized and universally accessible to all citizens, with <a href="/wiki/Affirmative_action" title="Affirmative action">affirmative action</a> for applicants from nations associated with <a href="/wiki/Cultural_backwardness" title="Cultural backwardness">cultural backwardness</a>. However, as part of the general <a href="/wiki/Antisemitism_in_the_Soviet_Union" title="Antisemitism in the Soviet Union">antisemitic policy</a>, an unofficial <a href="/wiki/Jewish_quota" title="Jewish quota">Jewish quota</a> was applied in the leading institutions of higher education by subjecting Jewish applicants to harsher entrance examinations. The Brezhnev era also introduced a rule that required all university applicants to present a reference from the local <a href="/wiki/Komsomol" title="Komsomol">Komsomol</a> party secretary. According to statistics from 1986, the number of higher education students per the population of 10,000 was 181 for the USSR, compared to 517 for the U.S.</p><p>The Soviet Union was a very ethnically diverse country, with more than 100 distinct ethnic groups. The total population was estimated at 293 million in 1991. According to a 1990 estimate, the majority were <a href="/wiki/Russians" title="Russians">Russians</a> (50.78%), followed by <a href="/wiki/Ukrainians" title="Ukrainians">Ukrainians</a> (15.45%) and <a href="/wiki/Uzbeks" title="Uzbeks">Uzbeks</a> (5.84%).</p><p>All citizens of the USSR had their own ethnic affiliation. The ethnicity of a person was chosen at the age of sixteen by the child&apos;s parents. If the parents did not agree, the child was automatically assigned the ethnicity of the father. Partly due to Soviet policies, some of the smaller minority ethnic groups were considered part of larger ones, such as the <a href="/wiki/Mingrelians" title="Mingrelians">Mingrelians</a> of <a href="/wiki/Georgian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic" title="Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic">Georgia</a>, who were classified with the linguistically related <a href="/wiki/Georgians" title="Georgians">Georgians</a>. Some ethnic groups voluntarily assimilated, while others were brought in by force. Russians, <a href="/wiki/Belarusians" title="Belarusians">Belarusians</a>, and Ukrainians shared close cultural ties, while other groups did not. With multiple nationalities living in the same territory, <a href="/wiki/Ethnic_conflicts_in_the_Soviet_Union" title="Ethnic conflicts in the Soviet Union">ethnic antagonisms</a> developed over the years.</p><p>In 1917, before the revolution, health conditions were significantly behind those of developed countries. As Lenin later noted, &quot;Either the lice will defeat socialism, or socialism will defeat the lice&quot;. The Soviet principle of health care was conceived by the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_(Soviet_Union)" title="Ministry of Health (Soviet Union)">People&apos;s Commissariat for Health</a> in 1918. Health care was to be controlled by the state and would be provided to its citizens free of charge, this at the time being a revolutionary concept. Article 42 of the <a href="/wiki/1977_Soviet_Constitution" title="1977 Soviet Constitution">1977 Soviet Constitution</a> gave all citizens the right to health protection and free access to any health institutions in the USSR. Before <a href="/wiki/Leonid_Brezhnev" title="Leonid Brezhnev">Leonid Brezhnev</a> became General Secretary, the healthcare system of the Soviet Union was held in high esteem by many foreign specialists. This changed however, from Brezhnev&apos;s accession and <a href="/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev" title="Mikhail Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>&apos;s tenure as leader, the Soviet health care system was heavily criticized for many basic faults, such as the quality of service and the unevenness in its provision. <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_(Soviet_Union)" title="Ministry of Health (Soviet Union)">Minister of Health</a> <a href="/wiki/Yevgeniy_Chazov" title="Yevgeniy Chazov">Yevgeniy Chazov</a>, during the <a href="/wiki/19th_Congress_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union">19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a>, while highlighting such Soviet successes as having the most doctors and hospitals in the world, recognized the system&apos;s areas for improvement and felt that billions of <a href="/wiki/Soviet_ruble" title="Soviet ruble">Soviet rubles</a> were squandered.</p><p>After the socialist revolution, the life expectancy for all age groups went up. This statistic in itself was seen by some that the <a href="/wiki/Socialist_mode_of_production" title="Socialist mode of production">socialist system</a> was superior to the <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capitalist system</a>. These improvements continued into the 1960s, when the life expectancy in the Soviet Union surpassed that of the United States. It remained stable during most years, although in the 1970s, it went down slightly, possibly because of <a href="/wiki/Alcohol_consumption_in_Russia" title="Alcohol consumption in Russia">alcohol abuse</a>. At the same time, infant mortality began to rise. After 1974, the government stopped publishing statistics on this. This trend can be partly explained by the number of pregnancies rising drastically in the Asian part of the country where infant mortality was highest, while declining markedly in the more developed European part of the Soviet Union. The USSR had several centers of excellence, such as the <a href="/wiki/Fyodorov_Eye_Microsurgery_Complex" title="Fyodorov Eye Microsurgery Complex">Fyodorov Eye Microsurgery Complex</a>, founded in 1988 by Russian eye surgeon <a href="/wiki/Svyatoslav_Fyodorov" title="Svyatoslav Fyodorov">Svyatoslav Fyodorov</a>.</p><p>The Soviet government headed by Vladimir Lenin gave small language groups their own writing systems. The development of these writing systems was very successful, even though some flaws were detected. During the later days of the USSR, countries with the same <a href="/wiki/Multilingualism" title="Multilingualism">multilingual</a> situation implemented similar policies. A serious problem when creating these writing systems was that the languages differed <a href="/wiki/Dialect" title="Dialect">dialectally</a> greatly from each other. When a language had been given a writing system and appeared in a notable publication, that language would attain &quot;official language&quot; status. There were many minority languages which never received their own writing system; therefore their speakers were forced to have a <a href="/wiki/Second_language" title="Second language">second language</a>. There are examples where the Soviet government retreated from this policy, most notable under Stalin&apos;s regime, where education was discontinued in languages which were not widespread enough. These languages were then assimilated into another language, mostly Russian. During the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)" title="Eastern Front (World War II)">Great Patriotic War</a>, some minority languages were banned, and their speakers accused of collaborating with the enemy.</p><p>As the most widely spoken of the Soviet Union&apos;s many languages, Russian <i>de facto</i> functioned as an official language, as the &quot;language of interethnic communication&quot; (<a href="/wiki/Russian_language" title="Russian language">Russian</a>: <span lang="ru">&#x44F;&#x437;&#x44B;&#x43A; &#x43C;&#x435;&#x436;&#x43D;&#x430;&#x446;&#x438;&#x43E;&#x43D;&#x430;&#x43B;&#x44C;&#x43D;&#x43E;&#x433;&#x43E; &#x43E;&#x431;&#x449;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x438;&#x44F;</span>), but only assumed the <i><a href="/wiki/De_jure" title="De jure">de jure</a></i> status as the official national language in 1990.</p><p>The religious made up a significant minority of the Soviet Union prior to break up. In 1990, the religious makeup was 20% Russian Orthodox, 10% Muslim, 7% Protestant, Armenian Apostolic, Georgian Orthodox, and Roman Catholic, less than 1% Jewish and 60% atheist.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> and <a href="/wiki/Islam" title="Islam">Islam</a> had the greatest number of adherents among the Soviet state&apos;s religious citizens. <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Christianity" title="Eastern Christianity">Eastern Christianity</a> predominated among Christians, with Russia&apos;s traditional <a href="/wiki/Russian_Orthodox_Church" title="Russian Orthodox Church">Russian Orthodox Church</a> being the Soviet Union&apos;s largest <a href="/wiki/Christian_denomination" title="Christian denomination">Christian denomination</a>. About 90 percent of the Soviet Union&apos;s Muslims were <a href="/wiki/Sunni" class="mw-redirect" title="Sunni">Sunnis</a>, with <a href="/wiki/Shia_Islam" title="Shia Islam">Shias</a> concentrated in <a href="/wiki/Azerbaijan_Soviet_Socialist_Republic" title="Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic">Azerbaijan</a>. Smaller groups included <a href="/wiki/Catholic_Church" title="Catholic Church">Roman Catholics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Judaism" title="Judaism">Jews</a>, <a href="/wiki/Buddhism" title="Buddhism">Buddhists</a>, and a variety of <a href="/wiki/Protestantism" title="Protestantism">Protestant</a> sects.</p><p>Religious influence had been strong in the Russian Empire. The Russian Orthodox Church enjoyed a privileged status as the church of the monarchy and took part in carrying out official state functions. The immediate period following the establishment of the Soviet state included a struggle against the Orthodox Church, which the revolutionaries considered an ally of the former <a href="/wiki/Ruling_class" title="Ruling class">ruling classes</a>.</p><p>In Soviet law, the &quot;freedom to hold religious services&quot; was constitutionally guaranteed, although the ruling Communist Party regarded religion as incompatible with the <a href="/wiki/Marxism" title="Marxism">Marxist</a> spirit of <a href="/wiki/Metaphysical_naturalism" title="Metaphysical naturalism">scientific materialism</a>. In practice, the Soviet system subscribed to a narrow interpretation of this right, and in fact utilized a range of official measures to discourage religion and curb the activities of religious groups.</p><p>The 1918 <a href="/wiki/Council_of_People%27s_Commissars" title="Council of People&apos;s Commissars">Council of People&apos;s Commissars</a> decree establishing the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) as a secular state also decreed that &quot;the teaching of religion in all [places] where subjects of general instruction are taught, is forbidden. Citizens may teach and may be taught religion privately.&quot; Among further restrictions, those adopted in 1929, a half-decade into Stalin&apos;s rule, included express prohibitions on a range of church activities, including meetings for organized <a href="/wiki/Bible_study_(Christian)" title="Bible study (Christian)">Bible study</a>. Both Christian and non-Christian establishments were shut down by the thousands in the 1920s and 1930s. By 1940, as many as 90 percent of the churches, synagogues, and mosques that had been operating in 1917 were closed.</p><p>Convinced that religious <a href="/wiki/Anti-Sovietism" title="Anti-Sovietism">anti-Sovietism</a> had become a thing of the past with most Soviet Christians, and with the looming threat of war, the Stalin regime began shifting to a more moderate religion policy in the late 1930s. Soviet religious establishments overwhelmingly rallied to support the war effort during <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)" title="Eastern Front (World War II)">the Soviet war with Nazi Germany</a>. Amid other accommodations to religious faith after Hitler attacked the Soviet Union, churches were reopened, <a href="/wiki/Radio_Moscow" title="Radio Moscow">Radio Moscow</a> began broadcasting a religious hour, and a historic meeting between Stalin and Orthodox Church leader <a href="/wiki/Patriarch_Sergius_of_Moscow" title="Patriarch Sergius of Moscow">Patriarch Sergius of Moscow</a> was held in 1943. Stalin had the support of the majority of the religious people in the Soviet Union even through the late 1980s. The general tendency of this period was an increase in religious activity among believers of all faiths.</p><p>The Soviet establishment under General Secretary <a href="/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev" title="Nikita Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a>&apos;s leadership clashed with the churches in 1958&#x2013;1964, a period when <a href="/wiki/Atheism" title="Atheism">atheism</a> was emphasized in the educational curriculum, and numerous state publications promoted atheistic views. During this period, the number of churches fell from 20,000 to 10,000 from 1959 to 1965, and the number of synagogues dropped from 500 to 97. The number of working mosques also declined, falling from 1,500 to 500 within a decade.</p><p>Religious institutions remained monitored by the Soviet government, but churches, synagogues, temples, and mosques were all given more leeway in the <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Soviet_Union_(1964%E2%80%9382)" title="History of the Soviet Union (1964&#x2013;82)">Brezhnev era</a>. Official relations between the Orthodox Church and the Soviet government again warmed to the point that the Brezhnev government twice honored Orthodox Patriarch <a href="/wiki/Patriarch_Alexy_I_of_Moscow" title="Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow">Alexy I</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Red_Banner_of_Labour" title="Order of the Red Banner of Labour">Order of the Red Banner of Labour</a>. A poll conducted by Soviet authorities in 1982 recorded 20 percent of the Soviet population as &quot;active religious believers.&quot;</p><p>Soviet efforts to expand social, political and economic opportunities for women constitute &quot;the earliest and perhaps most far-reaching attempt ever undertaken to transform the status and role of women.&quot;</p><p>The culture of the Soviet Union passed through several stages during the USSR&apos;s 69-year existence. During the first eleven years following the Revolution (1918&#x2013;1929), there was relative freedom and artists experimented with several different styles to find a distinctive Soviet style of art. Lenin wanted art to be accessible to the Russian people. On the other hand, hundreds of intellectuals, writers, and artists were exiled or executed, and their work banned, for example <a href="/wiki/Nikolay_Gumilyov" title="Nikolay Gumilyov">Nikolay Gumilyov</a> (shot for alleged conspiring against the Bolshevik regime) and <a href="/wiki/Yevgeny_Zamyatin" title="Yevgeny Zamyatin">Yevgeny Zamyatin</a> (banned).</p><p>The government encouraged a variety of trends. In art and literature, numerous schools, some traditional and others radically experimental, proliferated. Communist writers <a href="/wiki/Maxim_Gorky" title="Maxim Gorky">Maxim Gorky</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Mayakovsky" title="Vladimir Mayakovsky">Vladimir Mayakovsky</a> were active during this time. Film, as a means of influencing a largely illiterate society, received encouragement from the state; much of director <a href="/wiki/Sergei_Eisenstein" title="Sergei Eisenstein">Sergei Eisenstein</a>&apos;s best work dates from this period.</p><p>Later, during Stalin&apos;s rule, Soviet culture was characterized by the rise and domination of the government-imposed style of <a href="/wiki/Socialist_realism" title="Socialist realism">socialist realism</a>, with all other trends being severely repressed, with rare exceptions, for example <a href="/wiki/Mikhail_Bulgakov" title="Mikhail Bulgakov">Mikhail Bulgakov</a>&apos;s works. Many writers were imprisoned and killed.</p><p>Following the <a href="/wiki/Khrushchev_Thaw" title="Khrushchev Thaw">Khrushchev Thaw</a> of the late 1950s and early 1960s, censorship was diminished. During this time, a distinctive period of Soviet culture developed characterized by conformist public life and intense focus on personal life. Greater experimentation in art forms were again permissible, with the result that more sophisticated and subtly critical work began to be produced. The regime loosened its emphasis on socialist realism; thus, for instance, many protagonists of the novels of author <a href="/wiki/Yury_Trifonov" title="Yury Trifonov">Yury Trifonov</a> concerned themselves with problems of daily life rather than with building socialism. An underground dissident literature, known as <i><a href="/wiki/Samizdat" title="Samizdat">samizdat</a></i>, developed during this late period. In architecture the Khrushchev era mostly focused on functional design as opposed to the highly decorated style of Stalin&apos;s epoch.</p><p>In the second half of the 1980s, Gorbachev&apos;s policies of <i><a href="/wiki/Perestroika" title="Perestroika">perestroika</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Glasnost" title="Glasnost">glasnost</a></i> significantly expanded <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_expression" class="mw-redirect" title="Freedom of expression">freedom of expression</a> throughout the Soviet Union in the media &amp; press.</p><p><img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png" width="12" height="12" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/18px-PD-icon.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/24px-PD-icon.svg.png 2x" data-file-width="196" data-file-height="196">&#xA0;This article incorporates&#xA0;<a href="/wiki/Copyright_status_of_work_by_the_U.S._government" title="Copyright status of work by the U.S. government">public domain material</a> from websites or documents of the <a href="/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Country_Studies" title="Library of Congress Country Studies">Library of Congress Country Studies</a>.</p>
