<p><b>British withdrawal from the European Union</b> is a political goal that has been pursued by various individuals, <a href="/wiki/Advocacy_group" title="Advocacy group">advocacy groups</a>, and <a href="/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="List of political parties in the United Kingdom">political parties</a> from across the <a href="/wiki/Political_spectrum" title="Political spectrum">political spectrum</a> since the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> joined the precursor of the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> (EU) in 1973. <a href="/wiki/Withdrawal_from_the_European_Union" title="Withdrawal from the European Union">Withdrawal from the European Union</a> has been a right of EU <a href="/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union" title="Member state of the European Union">member states</a> since 2007 under <a href="/wiki/Article_50_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union" title="Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union">Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union</a>. It is often referred to as <b>Brexit</b>, or, in early usage, <b>Brixit</b>, both words derived by analogy from <a href="/wiki/Grexit" class="mw-redirect" title="Grexit">Grexit</a>.</p>
<p>In 1973, the UK joined the <a href="/wiki/European_Economic_Community" title="European Economic Community">European Economic Community</a> (EEC). In 1975, <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975" title="United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, 1975">a referendum</a> was held on the country&apos;s continued membership of the EEC, which was approved by 67% of voters. The EEC <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_European_Union" title="History of the European Union">later transformed into the EU</a>.</p>
<p>In 2016, <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum,_2016" title="United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016">a referendum</a> was held on the country&apos;s membership of the EU. This referendum was arranged by <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">Parliament</a> when it passed the <a href="/wiki/European_Union_Referendum_Act_2015" title="European Union Referendum Act 2015">European Union Referendum Act 2015</a>. The result was 52% in favour of leaving and 48% in favour of remaining, with a turnout of 72% of the electorate.</p>
<p>The process for the UK&apos;s withdrawal is uncertain under <a href="/wiki/EU_law" class="mw-redirect" title="EU law">EU law</a>, although it is generally expected to take at least two years. Article 50, which governs the withdrawal, has never been used before. The timing for leaving under the article is a strict two years, although extensions are possible once Britain gives an official notice, but no official notice seems likely to be forthcoming until after a new British Prime Minister is selected later in 2016. The assumption is that during the two year window new agreements may be negotiated, but there is no requirement that there be new agreements. The <a href="/wiki/British_Prime_Minister" class="mw-redirect" title="British Prime Minister">British Prime Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/David_Cameron" title="David Cameron">David Cameron</a> announced he will resign by October, while the <a href="/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland" title="First Minister of Scotland">First Minister of Scotland</a> <a href="/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon" title="Nicola Sturgeon">Nicola Sturgeon</a> has said that Scotland might refuse <a href="/wiki/Legislative_Consent_Motion" title="Legislative Consent Motion">consent</a> for legislation required to leave the EU.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</span></h2>
<p>The UK was not a signatory to the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Rome" title="Treaty of Rome">Treaty of Rome</a> which created the EEC in 1957. The country subsequently applied to join the organization in 1963 and again in 1967, but both applications were vetoed by the then <a href="/wiki/President_of_France" title="President of France">President of France</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle" title="Charles de Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a>, ostensibly because &quot;a number of aspects of Britain&apos;s economy, from working practices to agriculture&quot; [had] &quot;made Britain incompatible with Europe&quot; and that Britain harboured a &#x201C;deep-seated hostility&#x201D; to any pan-European project.</p>
<p>Once de Gaulle had relinquished the French presidency, the UK made a third application for membership, which was successful. Under the <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative</a> Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Edward_Heath" title="Edward Heath">Edward Heath</a> the <a href="/wiki/European_Communities_Act_1972_(UK)" title="European Communities Act 1972 (UK)">European Communities Act 1972</a> was enacted. On 1 January 1973 the United Kingdom joined the EEC, or &quot;<a href="/wiki/Common_Market" class="mw-redirect" title="Common Market">Common Market</a>&quot;. The opposition <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a>, led by <a href="/wiki/Harold_Wilson" title="Harold Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>, contested the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_October_1974" title="United Kingdom general election, October 1974">October 1974 general election</a> with a commitment to renegotiate Britain&apos;s terms of membership of the EEC and then hold a referendum on whether to remain in the EEC on the new terms.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="1975_referendum">1975 referendum</span></h2>

<p>In 1975, the United Kingdom held a <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975" title="United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, 1975">referendum on whether the UK should remain in the EEC</a>. All of the major political parties and mainstream press supported continuing membership of the EEC. However, there were significant splits within the ruling Labour party, the membership of which had voted 2:1 in favour of withdrawal at a one-day <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)_Conference" title="Labour Party (UK) Conference">party conference</a> on 26 April 1975. Since the cabinet was split between strongly <a href="/wiki/Pro-Europeanism" title="Pro-Europeanism">pro-European</a> and strongly <a href="/wiki/Euroscepticism" title="Euroscepticism">anti-European</a> ministers, <a href="/wiki/Harold_Wilson" title="Harold Wilson">Harold Wilson</a> suspended the <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_convention_(political_custom)" title="Constitutional convention (political custom)">constitutional convention</a> of <a href="/wiki/Cabinet_collective_responsibility" title="Cabinet collective responsibility">Cabinet collective responsibility</a> and allowed ministers to publicly campaign on either side. Seven of the twenty-three members of the cabinet opposed EEC membership.</p>
<p>On 5 June 1975, the <a href="/wiki/Constituency" class="mw-redirect" title="Constituency">electorate</a> were asked to vote yes or no on the question: &quot;Do you think the UK should stay in the <a href="/wiki/European_Community" class="mw-redirect" title="European Community">European Community</a> (Common Market)?&quot; Every administrative county in the UK had a majority of &quot;Yes&quot;, except the <a href="/wiki/Shetland_Islands" class="mw-redirect" title="Shetland Islands">Shetland Islands</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Outer_Hebrides" title="Outer Hebrides">Outer Hebrides</a>. In line with the outcome of the vote, the United Kingdom remained a member of the EEC.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Between_referendums">Between referendums</span></h2>
<p>The opposition Labour Party campaigned in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1983" title="United Kingdom general election, 1983">1983 general election</a> on a commitment to withdraw from the EEC. It was heavily defeated as the Conservative government of <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> was re-elected. The Labour Party subsequently changed its policy.</p>
<p>As a result of the <a href="/wiki/Maastricht_Treaty" title="Maastricht Treaty">Maastricht Treaty</a>, the EEC became the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> on 1 November 1993. The organization had evolved from an economic union into a political union. The name change reflected this.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Referendum_Party" title="Referendum Party">Referendum Party</a> was formed in 1994 by <a href="/wiki/Sir_James_Goldsmith" class="mw-redirect" title="Sir James Goldsmith">Sir James Goldsmith</a> to contest the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1997" title="United Kingdom general election, 1997">1997 general election</a> on a platform of providing a referendum on the UK&apos;s membership of the EU. It fielded candidates in 547 constituencies at that election and won 810,860 votes, 2.6% of total votes cast. It failed to win a single parliamentary seat as its vote was spread out, losing its <a href="/wiki/Deposit_(politics)" title="Deposit (politics)">deposit</a> (funded by Goldsmith) in 505 constituencies.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/UK_Independence_Party" title="UK Independence Party">UK Independence Party</a> (UKIP), a <a href="/wiki/Euroscepticism" title="Euroscepticism">Eurosceptic</a> political party, was also formed in 1993. It achieved third place in the UK during the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_2004_(United_Kingdom)" title="European Parliament election, 2004 (United Kingdom)">2004 European elections</a>, second place in the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_2009_(United_Kingdom)" title="European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)">2009 European elections</a> and first place in the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_2014_(United_Kingdom)" title="European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)">2014 European elections</a>, with 27.5% of the total vote. This was the first time since the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_December_1910" title="United Kingdom general election, December 1910">1910 general election</a> that any party other than the Labour or Conservative parties had taken the largest share of the vote in a nationwide election.</p>
<p>In 2014, UKIP won two by-elections, triggered when the sitting Conservative MPs defected to UKIP and then resigned. These were their first elected MPs. In 2015, the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2015" title="United Kingdom general election, 2015">2015 general election</a> UKIP took 12.6% of the total vote and <a href="/wiki/Clacton_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="Clacton (UK Parliament constituency)">held</a> one of the two seats won in 2014.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="2016_referendum">2016 referendum</span></h2>


<p>In 2012, Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/David_Cameron" title="David Cameron">David Cameron</a> rejected calls for a referendum on the UK&apos;s EU membership, but suggested the possibility of a future referendum to gauge public support. According to the BBC, &quot;The prime minister acknowledged the need to ensure the UK&apos;s position within the European Union had &apos;the full-hearted support of the British people&apos; but they needed to show &apos;tactical and strategic patience&apos;.&quot;</p>
<p>Under pressure from many of his MPs and from the rise of UKIP, in January 2013, Cameron announced that a Conservative government would hold an in-out referendum on EU membership before the end of 2017, on a renegotiated package, if elected in 2015.</p>
<p>The Conservative Party won the <a href="/wiki/2015_general_election" class="mw-redirect" title="2015 general election">2015 general election</a> with a majority. Soon afterwards the <a href="/wiki/European_Union_Referendum_Act_2015" title="European Union Referendum Act 2015">European Union Referendum Act 2015</a> was introduced into Parliament to enable the referendum. Despite being in favour of remaining in a reformed European Union himself, Cameron announced that Conservative Ministers and MPs were free to campaign in favour of remaining in the EU or leaving it, according to their conscience. This decision came after mounting pressure for a <a href="/wiki/Free_vote" class="mw-redirect" title="Free vote">free vote</a> for ministers. In an exception to the usual rule of <a href="/wiki/Cabinet_collective_responsibility" title="Cabinet collective responsibility">cabinet collective responsibility</a>, Cameron allowed cabinet ministers to publicly campaign for EU withdrawal.</p>
<p>In a speech to the House of Commons on 22 February 2016, Cameron announced a referendum date of 23 June 2016 and set out the legal framework for withdrawal from the European Union in circumstances where there was a referendum majority vote to leave, citing Article 50 of the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Lisbon" title="Treaty of Lisbon">Lisbon Treaty</a>. Cameron spoke of an intention to trigger the Article 50 process immediately following a leave vote and of the &quot;two-year time period to negotiate the arrangements for exit.&quot;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Campaign_groups">Campaign groups</span></h3>

<p>The official campaign group for leaving the EU was <a href="/wiki/Vote_Leave" title="Vote Leave">Vote Leave</a>. Other major campaign groups included <a href="/wiki/Leave.EU" title="Leave.EU">Leave.EU</a>, <a href="/wiki/Grassroots_Out" title="Grassroots Out">Grassroots Out</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Better_Off_Out" title="Better Off Out">Better Off Out</a>, while non-EU affiliated organisations also campaigned for the United Kingdom&apos;s withdrawal, such as the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_Freedom_of_Movement_Organisation" title="Commonwealth Freedom of Movement Organisation">Commonwealth Freedom of Movement Organisation</a>.</p>
<p>The official campaign to stay in the EU, chaired by <a href="/wiki/Stuart_Rose" title="Stuart Rose">Stuart Rose</a>, was known as <a href="/wiki/Britain_Stronger_in_Europe" title="Britain Stronger in Europe">Britain Stronger in Europe</a>, or informally as <i>Remain</i>. Other campaigns supporting remaining in the EU included Conservatives In, <a href="/wiki/Labour_In_for_Britain" title="Labour In for Britain">Labour In for Britain</a>, #INtogether (Liberal Democrats), Greens for a Better Europe, Scientists for EU, Environmentalists For Europe, Universities for Europe and Another Europe is Possible.</p>

</div>
<p>Public opinion on whether the UK should leave the EU or stay has varied. An October 2015 analysis of polling suggested that younger voters tend to support remaining in the EU, whereas older voters tend to support leaving, but there is no gender split in attitudes.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Voting_result">Voting result</span></h3>

<p>On the morning of 24 June, the result from the vote was that the United Kingdom had voted to leave the European Union by 52% to 48%.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Petitions_for_a_new_referendum">Petitions for a new referendum</span></h3>
<p>Within hours of the result&apos;s announcement, a petition, calling for a second referendum to be held in the event that a result was secured with less than 60% of the vote and on a turnout of less than 75%, attracted tens of thousands of new signatures. The petition had been initiated by William Oliver Healey of the <a href="/wiki/English_Democrats" title="English Democrats">English Democrats</a> on 23 May 2016, when the Remain faction had been leading in the polls. On 26 June Healey made it clear that the petition had actually been started to favour an exit from the EU. Some of the signatures were added fraudulently. By 10:40<span class="nowrap">&#xA0;</span>pm on 28 June it had attracted 4,000,003 signatures, about one quarter of the total number of remain votes in the referendum and over forty times the number needed for any petition to be considered for debate in Parliament. The Parliamentary Petitions Committee decided to defer its decision on this petition &quot;until the <a href="/wiki/Government_Digital_Service" title="Government Digital Service">Government Digital Service</a> has done all it can to verify the signatures on the petition&quot;. 77,000 fraudulent signatures have been removed from the online petition. The Committee stated that, &quot;although it may choose to schedule a debate on this petition in due course, it only has the power to schedule debates in <a href="/wiki/Westminster_Hall" class="mw-redirect" title="Westminster Hall">Westminster Hall</a> &#x2013; the second debating chamber of the House of Commons. Debates in Westminster Hall do not have the power to change the law, and could not trigger a second referendum&quot;.</p>
<p>On 27 June 2016, the resigning Prime Minister&apos;s spokesperson stated that holding another vote on Britain&apos;s membership to the European Union was &quot;not remotely on the cards.&quot; Home Secretary <a href="/wiki/Theresa_May" title="Theresa May">Theresa May</a> made the following comment when announcing her candidacy to replace David Cameron as Conservative leader (and hence as Prime Minister) on 30 June 2016: &quot;The campaign was fought ... and the public gave their verdict. There must be no attempts to remain inside the EU ... and no second referendum. ... Brexit means Brexit.&quot;</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id=".22Article_50.22_and_the_procedure_for_leaving_the_EU">&quot;Article 50&quot; and the procedure for leaving the EU</span></h2>

<p><a href="/wiki/Article_50_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union" title="Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union">Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union</a> provides that: &quot;Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements.&quot; Article 50 was inserted by the <a href="/wiki/Lisbon_Treaty" class="mw-redirect" title="Lisbon Treaty">Lisbon Treaty</a> in 2007, before which the treaties were silent on the possibility of <a href="/wiki/Withdrawal_from_the_European_Union" title="Withdrawal from the European Union">withdrawal from the European Union</a>. Once a member state has notified the <a href="/wiki/European_Council" title="European Council">European Council</a> of its intent to leave the EU, a period begins during which a leaving agreement is negotiated setting out the arrangements for the withdrawal and outlining the country&apos;s future relationship with the Union. For the agreement to enter into force it needs to be approved by at least 72 percent of the continuing member states representing at least 65 percent of their population, and the consent of the European Parliament. The treaties cease to apply to the member state concerned on the entry into force of the leaving agreement, or in the absence of such an agreement, two years after the member state notified the European Council of its intent to leave, although this period can be extended by unanimous agreement of the European Council.</p>
<p>As was the case with the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_independence_referendum,_2014" title="Scottish independence referendum, 2014">Scottish independence referendum</a> two years earlier, the 2016 referendum did not directly require the government to do anything in particular. It does not require the government to initiate, or even schedule, the Article 50 procedure, although David Cameron stated during the campaign that he would invoke Article 50 straight away in the event of a leave victory. However, following the referendum result Cameron announced that he would resign before the Conservative party conference in October, and that it would be for the incoming Prime Minister to invoke Article 50.</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">

<p>There is no established, formal process for holding a second referendum to &quot;confirm&quot; the decision to leave following negotiations. Alan Renwick of the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_Unit" title="Constitution Unit">Constitution Unit</a> of University College London argues that Article 50 negotiations cannot be used to renegotiate the conditions of future membership and that Article 50 does not provide the legal basis of withdrawing a decision to leave. The UK government has stated that they would expect a leave vote to be followed by withdrawal, not by a second vote.</p>
<p>As long as the UK Government has not invoked Article 50, the UK stays a member of the EU; must continue to fulfill all EU-related treaties, including possible future agreements; and should legally be treated as a member. The EU has no framework to exclude the UK&#x2014;or any member&#x2014;as long as Article 50 is not invoked, and the UK does not violate EU laws. However, if the UK were to breach EU law significantly, there are legal venues to discharge the UK from the EU via Article 7, so called the &quot;nuclear option&quot; which allows the EU to cancel membership of a state that breaches fundamental EU principles, a test that will be hard to pass. Article 7 does not allow forced cancellation of membership, only denial of rights such as free trade, free movement and voting rights.</p>
<p>Various EU leaders have said that they will not start any negotiation before the UK formally invokes Article 50. Jean-Claude Juncker even ordered all members of the EU Commission not to engage in any kind of contact with UK parties regarding Brexit. Media statements of various kinds still occur. For example, on June 29, European Council president Donald Tusk told the UK that they won&apos;t be allowed access to the <a href="/wiki/Internal_market" title="Internal market">European Single Market</a> unless they accept its four freedoms of goods, capital, services, and people. Angela Merkel said &quot;We&apos;ll ensure that negotiations don&apos;t take place according to the principle of cherry-picking ... It must and will make a noticeable difference whether a country wants to be a member of the family of the European Union or not&quot;.</p>
<p>Cameron has declared that the next Prime Minister should activate Article 50 and begin negotiations with the EU. During a 27 June 2016 meeting, the Cabinet decided to establish a unit of civil servants, headed by senior Conservative <a href="/wiki/Oliver_Letwin" title="Oliver Letwin">Oliver Letwin</a>, who would proceed with &quot;intensive work on the issues that will need to be worked through in order to present options and advice to a new Prime Minister and a new Cabinet&quot;.</p>
<p>After a debate about the planned UK exit on 28 June 2016, the EU Parliament passed a motion calling for the &quot;immediate&quot; triggering of Article 50, although there is no mechanism allowing the EU to invoke the article.</p>

<p>Now that the UK electorate has voted to leave the EU, its subsequent relationship with the remaining EU members could take several forms. A research paper presented to the UK Parliament proposed a number of alternatives to membership which would continue to allow access with the EU <a href="/wiki/Internal_market" title="Internal market">internal market</a>. These include remaining in the <a href="/wiki/European_Economic_Area" title="European Economic Area">European Economic Area</a> (EEA) as a <a href="/wiki/European_Free_Trade_Association" title="European Free Trade Association">European Free Trade Association</a> (EFTA) member (alongside <a href="/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Liechtenstein" title="Liechtenstein">Liechtenstein</a>, <a href="/wiki/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a> and <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>), or seeking to negotiate bilateral terms more along the <a href="/wiki/Switzerland%E2%80%93European_Union_relations" title="Switzerland&#x2013;European Union relations">Swiss model</a> with a series of interdependent sectoral agreements. Britain has not negotiated a trade agreement since before 1973, and the government is looking to the private sector for assistance.</p>
<p>Were the UK to join the EEA as an EFTA member, it would have to sign up to EU internal market legislation without being able to participate in its development or vote on its content. However, the EU is required to conduct extensive consultations with non-EU members beforehand via its many committees and cooperative bodies. Some EU law originates from various international bodies on which non-EU EEA countries have a seat.</p>
<p>The EEA Agreement (EU and EFTA members except Switzerland) does not cover <a href="/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy" title="Common Agricultural Policy">Common Agriculture and Fisheries Policies</a>, <a href="/wiki/European_Union_Customs_Union" title="European Union Customs Union">Customs Union</a>, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Common_Commercial_Policy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Common Commercial Policy (page does not exist)">Common Trade Policy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Common_Foreign_and_Security_Policy" title="Common Foreign and Security Policy">Common Foreign and Security Policy</a>, direct and indirect taxation, and <a href="/wiki/Police_and_Judicial_Co-operation_in_Criminal_Matters" title="Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters">Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters</a>, leaving EFTA members free to set their own policies in these areas; however, EFTA countries are required to contribute to the <a href="/wiki/EU_Budget" class="mw-redirect" title="EU Budget">EU Budget</a> in exchange for access to the internal market.</p>
<p>The EEA Agreement and the agreement with Switzerland cover free movement of goods, and <a href="/wiki/Free_Movement_Directive" class="mw-redirect" title="Free Movement Directive">free movement of people</a>. Many supporters of Brexit want to restrict freedom of movement; however, an EEA Agreement would include free movement for EU and EEA citizens, as passport systems allow EEA institutions to access markets in EU Member States, for the most part, without having to establish subsidiaries in each EU Member State and incur the costs of full authorisation in those jurisdiction. Others present ideas of a <a href="/wiki/Switzerland%E2%80%93European_Union_relations" title="Switzerland&#x2013;European Union relations">Swiss solution</a>, that is tailor-made agreements between the UK and the EU, but EU representatives have claimed they would not support such a solution. The Swiss agreements contain free movement for EU citizens.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Relationship_between_remaining_EU_members">Relationship between remaining EU members</span></h3>
<p>A report by Tim Oliver of the <a href="/wiki/German_Institute_for_International_and_Security_Affairs" title="German Institute for International and Security Affairs">German Institute for International and Security Affairs</a> expanded analysis of what a British withdrawal could mean for the EU: the report argues a UK withdrawal &quot;has the potential to fundamentally change the EU and European integration. On the one hand, a withdrawal could tip the EU towards protectionism, exacerbate existing divisions, or unleash centrifugal forces leading to the EU&apos;s unravelling. Alternatively, the EU could free itself of its most awkward member, making the EU easier to lead and more effective.&quot;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Immigration">Immigration</span></h3>
<p>The Conservative <a href="/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament" title="Member of the European Parliament">MEP</a> representing South East England, <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Hannan" title="Daniel Hannan">Daniel Hannan</a>, predicted on BBC <i><a href="/wiki/Newsnight" title="Newsnight">Newsnight</a></i> that the level of immigration would remain high after Brexit: &quot;Frankly, if people watching think that they have voted and there is now going to be zero immigration from the EU, they are going to be disappointed. ... you will look in vain for anything that the Leave campaign said at any point that ever suggested there would ever be any kind of border closure or drawing up of the drawbridge.&quot;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Economic_effects">Economic effects</span></h3>
<p>The UK treasury have estimated that being in the EU has a strong positive effect on trade and as a result the UK&apos;s trade would be worse off if it left the EU.</p>
<p>Supporters of withdrawal from the EU have argued that by ceasing to make a net contribution to the EU would allow for some cuts to taxes and/or increases in government spending. However, Britain would still be required to make contributions to the EU budget if it opted to remain in the European Free Trade Area. The Institute for Fiscal Studies notes that most majority of forecasts of the impact of Brexit on the UK economy would leave the government with less money to spend even if it no longer had to pay into the EU.</p>
<p>Former <a href="/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer" title="Chancellor of the Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> <a href="/wiki/Norman_Lamont" title="Norman Lamont">Norman Lamont</a> argued that if Britain left the EU, the EU would not impose retaliatory tariffs on British products, pointing out that the EU needed a trade agreement with Britain as German car manufacturers wanted to sell their cars to the world&apos;s fifth biggest market. Lamont argued that the <a href="/wiki/EFTA" class="mw-redirect" title="EFTA">EFTA</a> option was irrelevant and that Britain and the EU would agree on a trade pact which tailored to Britain&apos;s needs.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/James_Dyson" title="James Dyson">James Dyson</a> argued that it would be self-defeating for the EU to impose retaliatory <a href="/wiki/Tariff" title="Tariff">tariffs</a> on British products because if the EU imposed a tariff on Britain, Britain would impose a retaliatory tariff on the EU, claiming that Britain bought 100&#xA0;billion pounds worth of the EU&apos;s goods and sold 10&#xA0;billion pounds worth of Britain&apos;s goods. However, proportionally, the government responded that &quot;EU exports to the UK are worth 3% of EU GDP, while UK exports to the EU are worth 13% of UK GDP &#x2013; four times more.&quot;</p>
<p>On 15 June 2016, <a href="/wiki/Vote_Leave" title="Vote Leave">Vote Leave</a>, the official Leave campaign, presented its roadmap to lay out what would happen if Britain left the EU. The blueprint suggested that Parliament would pass laws: Finance Bill to scrap VAT on <a href="/wiki/Tampon" title="Tampon">tampons</a> and household energy bills; Asylum and Immigration Control Bill to end the automatic right of EU citizens to enter Britain; National Health Service (Funding Target) Bill to get an extra 100 million pounds a week; European Union Law (Emergency Provisions) Bill; Free Trade Bill to start to negotiate its own deals with non-EU countries; and European Communities Act 1972 (Repeal) Bill to end the <a href="/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice" title="European Court of Justice">European Court of Justice</a>&apos;s jurisdiction over Britain and stop making contribution to the EU budget.</p>
<p>Some nations and cities may gain economic benefits from Brexit. In the wake of the vote, several global banks quickly began the process of shifting some operations out of <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> and into other European financial centres, including <a href="/wiki/Frankfurt" title="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Dublin" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>, in order to establish new legal domiciles in Europe in case London headquarters are no longer legally sufficient to serve the rest of the continent. While other European financial centres may benefit, those gains would come at a cost to London&apos;s global financial importance, as it is presumed London would lose those financial services jobs. For example, the day following the vote, <a href="/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase" title="JPMorgan Chase">JP Morgan Chase</a> CEO <a href="/wiki/Jamie_Dimon" title="Jamie Dimon">Jamie Dimon</a> told employees that the company &#x201C;may need to make changes to our legal entity structure and the location of some roles.&#x201D; Brexit may also lead to increased real estate prices in New York. Many attorneys worry about the potential for contracts to be invalidated for <a href="/wiki/Frustration_of_purpose" title="Frustration of purpose">Frustration of Purpose</a>.</p>
<p>Former <a href="/wiki/Bundesbank" class="mw-redirect" title="Bundesbank">Bundesbank</a> President <a href="/wiki/Axel_A._Weber" title="Axel A. Weber">Axel Weber</a> said that leaving the EU would not deal a major blow to London&apos;s status as one of the top financial hubs.</p>
<p>On 24 June 2016, the bond and credit rating agency of <a href="/wiki/Moody%27s" class="mw-redirect" title="Moody&apos;s">Moody&apos;s</a>, on the basis of the result of the referendum, downgraded the UK&apos;s standing as a long-term debt issuer and the country&apos;s debt rating outlook to &quot;negative&quot; from &quot;stable,&quot; while retaining the overall rating of <a href="/wiki/Moody%27s_Investors_Service#Moody.27s_credit_ratings" title="Moody&apos;s Investors Service">Aa1</a>. <a href="/wiki/Fitch_Ratings" title="Fitch Ratings">Fitch Ratings</a> degraded the credit rating from AA+ to AA because of &quot;uncertainty following the referendum outcome will induce an abrupt slowdown in short-term GDP growth...&quot;. Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s cut the UK&apos;s rating to AA, with the following comment: &quot;In our opinion, this outcome is a seminal event, and will lead to a less predictable, stable, and effective policy framework in the U.K. ... The negative outlook reflects the risk to economic prospects, fiscal and external performance, and the role of sterling as a reserve currency&quot;. On the other hand, economic analysts have pointed out that the UK, as a fiscally and monetarily sovereign nation, retains the ability to service or retire, at any time, any part or all of the state debt that is denominated in the <a href="/wiki/National_currency" class="mw-redirect" title="National currency">national currency</a>, and, hence, there is no risk whatsoever of defaulting on that part of its debt.</p>
<p>On 27 June 2016, Chancellor of the Exchequer <a href="/wiki/George_Osborne" title="George Osborne">George Osborne</a> attempted to reassure financial markets that the UK economy was not in serious trouble. This came after media reports that a survey by the <a href="/wiki/Institute_of_Directors" title="Institute of Directors">Institute of Directors</a> suggested that two thirds of businesses believed that the outcome of the referendum would produce negative results as well as the dropping value of the sterling and the FTSE 100, which began on 24 June 2016. British businesses had also predicted that investment cuts, hiring freezes and redundancies would be necessary to cope with the results of the referendum. Osborne indicated that Britain was facing the future &quot;from a position of strength&quot; and there was no current need for an emergency Budget. &quot;No one should doubt our resolve to maintain the fiscal stability we have delivered for this country .... And to companies, large and small, I would say this: the British economy is fundamentally strong, highly competitive and we are open for business.&quot;</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Long-term_economic_prospects">Long-term economic prospects</span></h4>
<p>European experts from the <a href="/wiki/World_Pensions_%26_Investments_Forum" title="World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum">World Pensions Forum</a> and the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Bath" title="University of Bath">University of Bath</a> have argued that, beyond short-lived market volatility, the long term economic prospects of Britain remain high, notably in terms of <a href="/wiki/Country_attractiveness" title="Country attractiveness">country attractiveness</a> and <a href="/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment" title="Foreign direct investment">foreign direct investment</a>: &quot;Country risk experts we spoke to are confident the UK&apos;s economy will remain robust in the event of an exit from the EU. &apos;The economic attractiveness of Britain will not go down and a trade war with London is in no one&apos;s interest,&apos; says M Nicolas Firzli, director-general of the World Pensions Council (WPC) and advisory board member for the World Bank Global Infrastructure Facility [...] Bruce Morley, lecturer in economics at the University of Bath, goes further to suggest that the long-term benefits to the UK of leaving the Union, such as less regulation and more control over Britain&apos;s trade policy, could outweigh the short-term uncertainty observed in the [country risk] scores.&quot;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Possible_secessions:_Scotland.2C_Northern_Ireland.2C_Gibraltar">Possible secessions: Scotland, Northern Ireland, Gibraltar</span></h3>
<p>Prior to the referendum, leading figures with a range of opinions regarding <a href="/wiki/Scottish_independence" title="Scottish independence">Scottish independence</a> suggested that in the event the UK as a whole voted to leave the EU but Scotland as a whole voted to remain, a <a href="/wiki/Second_Scottish_independence_referendum" class="mw-redirect" title="Second Scottish independence referendum">second Scottish independence referendum</a> might be precipitated. Former Labour Scottish First Minister <a href="/wiki/Henry_McLeish" title="Henry McLeish">Henry McLeish</a> asserted that he would support Scottish independence under such circumstances. It has also been pointed out that upon the UK&apos;s exit from the EU, many of the powers and competencies of the EU institutions would be repatriated to <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Parliament" title="Scottish Parliament">Holyrood</a> and not Westminster. In 2013, Scotland exported around three and a half times more to the rest of the UK than to the rest of the EU. The pro-union organisation, Scotland in Union, has suggested that an independent Scotland within the EU would face trade barriers with a post-Brexit UK and face additional costs for re-entry to the EU.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Enda_Kenny" title="Enda Kenny">Enda Kenny</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Taoiseach" title="Taoiseach">Taoiseach</a> of Ireland, has warned that a UK exit of the European Union could damage the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland_peace_process" title="Northern Ireland peace process">Northern Ireland peace process</a>. <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Secretary" class="mw-redirect" title="Northern Ireland Secretary">Northern Ireland Secretary</a> <a href="/wiki/Theresa_Villiers" title="Theresa Villiers">Theresa Villiers</a> denounced the suggestion as &quot;scaremongering of the worst possible kind&quot;. It has been suggested by a member of Germany&apos;s parliamentary finance committee that a &quot;bilateral solution&quot; between the UK and Ireland could be negotiated quickly after a leave vote. On 24 June 2016, following the UK&apos;s vote to leave the EU, <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>&apos;s Deputy First Minister <a href="/wiki/Martin_McGuinness" title="Martin McGuinness">Martin McGuinness</a> called for a referendum on <a href="/wiki/United_Ireland" title="United Ireland">Irish reunification</a>.</p>
<p>In 2015, <a href="/wiki/Chief_Minister_of_Gibraltar" title="Chief Minister of Gibraltar">Chief Minister of Gibraltar</a> <a href="/wiki/Fabian_Picardo" title="Fabian Picardo">Fabian Picardo</a> suggested that Gibraltar would attempt to remain part of the EU in the event the UK voted to leave, but reaffirmed that, regardless of the result, the territory would remain British. In a letter to the UK <a href="/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Select_Committee" title="Foreign Affairs Select Committee">Foreign Affairs Select Committee</a>, he requested that Gibraltar be considered in negotiations post-Brexit. <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a>&apos;s foreign minister <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Garc%C3%ADa-Margallo_y_Marfil" title="Jos&#xE9; Garc&#xED;a-Margallo y Marfil">Jos&#xE9; Garc&#xED;a-Margallo</a> said Spain would seek talks on Gibraltar the &quot;very next day&quot; after a British exit from the EU.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Status_of_London">Status of London</span></h3>
<p>The majority of those living in London voted to remain in the EU. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she had spoken to London Mayor <a href="/wiki/Sadiq_Khan" title="Sadiq Khan">Sadiq Khan</a> about the possibility of remaining in the EU and said he shared that objective for London. A petition calling on Khan to <a href="/wiki/London_secessionism" class="mw-redirect" title="London secessionism">declare London independent</a> from the UK received tens of thousands of signatures. Supporters of London&apos;s independence argued that London should become a <a href="/wiki/City-state" title="City-state">city-state</a> similar to Singapore, while remaining within the EU. <a href="/wiki/Spencer_Livermore,_Baron_Livermore" title="Spencer Livermore, Baron Livermore">Spencer Livermore, Baron Livermore</a>, said that London&apos;s independence &quot;should be a goal&quot;, arguing that a London city-state would have twice the GDP of Singapore.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Border_with_France">Border with France</span></h3>
<p>The Mayor of <a href="/wiki/Saint-Quentin,_Aisne" title="Saint-Quentin, Aisne">Saint-Quentin</a> <a href="/wiki/Xavier_Bertrand" title="Xavier Bertrand">Xavier Bertrand</a> stated in February 2016 that &quot;If Britain leaves Europe, right away the border will leave Calais and go to Dover. We will not continue to guard the border for Britain if it&apos;s no longer in the European Union&quot; indicating that the <a href="/wiki/Juxtaposed_controls" title="Juxtaposed controls">juxtaposed controls</a> would end with a leave vote. <a href="/wiki/Minister_of_the_Economy,_Finances_and_Industry_(France)" title="Minister of the Economy, Finances and Industry (France)">French Finance Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron" title="Emmanuel Macron">Emmanuel Macron</a> also suggested the agreement would be &quot;threatened&quot; by a leave vote. These claims have been disputed, as the Le Touquet treaty enabling juxtaposed controls was not debated from within the EU, and would not be legally void upon leaving. After the Brexit vote, Xavier Bertrand asked <a href="/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Hollande" title="Fran&#xE7;ois Hollande">Fran&#xE7;ois Hollande</a> to renogotiate the Touquet agreement, which can be terminated by either party with two years notice. Hollande rejected the suggestion, and said: &quot;Calling into question the Touquet deal on the pretext that Britain has voted for Brexit and will have to start negotiations to leave the Union doesn&apos;t make sense.&quot; <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Cazeneuve" title="Bernard Cazeneuve">Bernard Cazeneuve</a>, the French Interior Minister, confirmed there would be &quot;no changes to the accord&quot;. He said: &quot;The border at Calais is closed and will remain so.&quot;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Academic_funding">Academic funding</span></h3>
<p>UK universities rely on the EU for around 16% of their total research funding, and are disproportionately successful at winning EU-awarded research grants. This has raised questions about how such funding would be impacted by a British exit.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/St_George%27s,_University_of_London" title="St George&apos;s, University of London">St George&apos;s, University of London</a> professor <a href="/wiki/Angus_Dalgleish" title="Angus Dalgleish">Angus Dalgleish</a> pointed out that Britain paid much more into the EU research budget than it received, and that existing European collaboration such as <a href="/wiki/CERN" title="CERN">CERN</a> and <a href="/wiki/European_Molecular_Biology_Laboratory" title="European Molecular Biology Laboratory">European Molecular Biology Laboratory</a> (EMBL) began long before the <a href="/wiki/Lisbon_Treaty" class="mw-redirect" title="Lisbon Treaty">Lisbon Treaty</a>, adding that leaving the EU would not damage Britain&apos;s science.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/London_School_of_Economics" title="London School of Economics">London School of Economics</a> emeritus professor <a href="/wiki/Alan_Sked" title="Alan Sked">Alan Sked</a> pointed out that non-EU countries such as <a href="/wiki/Israel" title="Israel">Israel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> signed agreements with the EU in terms of the funding of collaborative research and projects, and suggested that if Britain left the EU, Britain would be able to reach a similar agreement with the EU, pointing out that educated people and research bodies would easily find some financial arrangement during an at least 2-year transition period which was related to Article 50 of <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_European_Union" class="mw-redirect" title="Treaty of European Union">Treaty of European Union</a> (TEU).</p>
