<p>A <b>book</b> is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of <a href="/wiki/Ink" title="Ink">ink</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paper" title="Paper">paper</a>, <a href="/wiki/Parchment" title="Parchment">parchment</a>, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side. A single sheet within a book is a <a href="/wiki/Recto" title="Recto" class="mw-redirect">leaf</a>, and each side of a leaf is a <a href="/wiki/Page_(paper)" title="Page (paper)">page</a>. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or <a href="/wiki/E-book" title="E-book">e-book</a>.</p>
<p>Books may also refer to works of literature, or a main division of such a work. In <a href="/wiki/Library_and_information_science" title="Library and information science">library and information science</a>, a book is called a <a href="/wiki/Monograph" title="Monograph">monograph</a>, to distinguish it from serial <a href="/wiki/Periodical" title="Periodical" class="mw-redirect">periodicals</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Magazine" title="Magazine">magazines</a>, <a href="/wiki/Academic_journal" title="Academic journal">journals</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Newspaper" title="Newspaper">newspapers</a>. The body of all written works including books is <a href="/wiki/Literature" title="Literature">literature</a>. In <a href="/wiki/Novel" title="Novel">novels</a> and sometimes other types of books (for example, biographies), a book may be divided into several large sections, also called books (Book 1, Book 2, Book 3, and so on). An avid reader of books is a <a href="/wiki/Bibliophilia" title="Bibliophilia">bibliophile</a> or colloquially, bookworm.</p>
<p>A shop where <a href="/wiki/Bookselling" title="Bookselling">books are bought and sold</a> is a bookshop or bookstore. Books can also be borrowed from <a href="/wiki/Lending_library" title="Lending library">libraries</a>. <a href="/wiki/Google" title="Google">Google</a> has estimated that as of 2010, approximately 130,000,000 distinct titles had been published.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> In some wealthier nations, printed books are giving way to the usage of <a href="/wiki/Ebooks" title="Ebooks" class="mw-redirect">electronic or e-books</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> though sales of e-books declined in the first half of 2015.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>The word book comes from <a href="/wiki/Old_English" title="Old English">Old English</a> &quot;b&#x14D;c&quot;, which in turn comes from the <a href="/wiki/Germanic_languages" title="Germanic languages">Germanic</a> root &quot;*b&#x14D;k-&quot;, <a href="/wiki/Cognate" title="Cognate">cognate</a> to &quot;<a href="/wiki/Beech" title="Beech">beech</a>&quot;.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Similarly, in <a href="/wiki/Slavic_languages" title="Slavic languages">Slavic languages</a> (for example, <a href="/wiki/Russian_language" title="Russian language">Russian</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bulgarian_language" title="Bulgarian language">Bulgarian</a>, <a href="/wiki/Macedonian_language" title="Macedonian language">Macedonian</a>) &quot;&#x431;&#x443;&#x43A;&#x432;&#x430;&quot; (bukva&#x2014;&quot;letter&quot;) is cognate with &quot;beech&quot;. In Russian and in <a href="/wiki/Serbian_language" title="Serbian language">Serbian</a> and Macedonian, the word &quot;&#x431;&#x443;&#x43A;&#x432;&#x430;&#x440;&#x44C;&quot; (bukvar&apos;) or &quot;&#x431;&#x443;&#x43A;&#x432;&#x430;&#x440;&quot; (bukvar) refers specifically to a primary school textbook that helps young children master the techniques of reading and writing. It is thus conjectured that the earliest <a href="/wiki/Indo-European_languages" title="Indo-European languages">Indo-European</a> writings may have been carved on beech wood.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> Similarly, the Latin word <i>codex</i>, meaning a book in the modern sense (bound and with separate leaves), originally meant &quot;block of wood&quot;.</p>

<p>When <a href="/wiki/History_of_writing" title="History of writing">writing systems</a> were created in <a href="/wiki/Ancient_civilization" title="Ancient civilization" class="mw-redirect">ancient civilizations</a>, a variety of objects, such as stone, <a href="/wiki/Clay_tablet" title="Clay tablet">clay</a>, tree bark, metal sheets, might be used for writing. The study of such inscriptions forms a major part of history. The study of inscriptions is known as <a href="/wiki/Epigraphy" title="Epigraphy">epigraphy</a>. <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_alphabet" title="History of the alphabet">Alphabetic writing</a> emerged in <a href="/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>. The Ancient Egyptians would often write on <a href="/wiki/Papyrus" title="Papyrus">papyrus</a>, a plant grown along the Nile River. At first the words were not separated from each other (<i><a href="/wiki/Scriptura_continua" title="Scriptura continua" class="mw-redirect">scriptura continua</a></i>) and there was no <a href="/wiki/Punctuation" title="Punctuation">punctuation</a>. Texts were written from right to left, left to right, or even so that alternate lines read in opposite directions. The technical term for that last type of writing is &apos;<a href="/wiki/Boustrophedon" title="Boustrophedon">boustrophedon</a>&apos;, which means literally &apos;ox-turning&apos; for the way a farmer drives an ox to plough his fields.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Tablet">Tablet</span></h4>
<p>A tablet might be defined as a physically robust writing medium, suitable for casual transport and writing. See also <a href="/wiki/Stylus" title="Stylus">stylus</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Clay_tablet" title="Clay tablet">Clay tablets</a> were flattened and mostly dry pieces of clay that could be easily carried, and impressed with a (possibly dampened) <a href="/wiki/Stylus" title="Stylus">stylus</a>.

<p><a href="/wiki/Wax_tablet" title="Wax tablet">Wax tablets</a> were pieces of wood covered in a thick enough coating of wax to record the impressions of a stylus. They were the normal writing material in schools, in accounting, and for taking notes. They had the advantage of being reusable: the wax could be melted, and reformed into a blank. The custom of binding several wax tablets together (Roman <i>pugillares</i>) is a possible precursor for modern books (i.e. codex).<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> The etymology of the word <i>codex</i> (block of wood) also suggests that it may have developed from wooden wax tablets.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Herodotus" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> (History 5:58), the <a href="/wiki/Phoenicians" title="Phoenicians" class="mw-redirect">Phoenicians</a> brought writing and papyrus to Greece around the 10th or 9th century BC. The Greek word for papyrus as writing material (<i>biblion</i>) and book (<i>biblos</i>) come from the Phoenician port town <a href="/wiki/Byblos" title="Byblos">Byblos</a>, through which papyrus was exported to Greece.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> From Greek we also derive the word tome (<a href="/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a>: <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">&#x3C4;&#x3CC;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>), which originally meant a slice or piece and from there began to denote &quot;a roll of papyrus&quot;. <i>Tomus</i> was used by the Latins with exactly the same meaning as <i>volumen</i> (see also below the explanation by Isidore of Seville).</p>
<p>Whether made from papyrus, <a href="/wiki/Parchment" title="Parchment">parchment</a>, or paper, scrolls were the dominant form of book in the Hellenistic, Roman, Chinese, Hebrew, and Macedonian cultures. The more modern <a href="/wiki/Codex" title="Codex">codex</a> book format form took over the Roman world by <a href="/wiki/Late_antiquity" title="Late antiquity" class="mw-redirect">late antiquity</a>, but the scroll format persisted much longer in Asia.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="/wiki/Isidore_of_Seville" title="Isidore of Seville">Isidore of Seville</a> (died 636) explained the then-current relation between codex, book and scroll in his Etymologiae (VI.13): &quot;A codex is composed of many books; a book is of one scroll. It is called codex by way of metaphor from the trunks (<i>codex</i>) of trees or vines, as if it were a wooden stock, because it contains in itself a multitude of books, as it were of branches.&quot; Modern usage differs.</p>
<p>A codex (in modern usage) is the first information repository that modern people would recognize as a &quot;book&quot;: leaves of uniform size <a href="/wiki/Bookbinding" title="Bookbinding">bound</a> in some manner along one edge, and typically held between two <a href="/wiki/Book_cover" title="Book cover">covers</a> made of some more robust material. The first written mention of the codex as a form of book is from <a href="/wiki/Martial" title="Martial">Martial</a>, in his Apophoreta <small>CLXXXIV</small> at the end of the first century, where he praises its compactness. However, the codex never gained much popularity in the pagan Hellenistic world, and only within the Christian community did it gain widespread use.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> This change happened gradually during the 3rd and 4th centuries, and the reasons for adopting the codex form of the book are several: the format is more economical, as both sides of the writing material can be used; and it is portable, searchable, and easy to conceal. A book is much easier to read, to find a page that you want, and to flip through. A scroll is more awkward to use. The Christian <a href="/wiki/Author" title="Author">authors</a> may also have wanted to distinguish their writings from the pagan and Judaic texts written on scrolls. In addition, some metal books were made, that required smaller pages of metal, instead of an impossibly long, unbending scroll of metal. A book can also be easily stored in more compact places, or side by side in a tight library or shelf space.</p>

This gave writing a brownish black color, but black or brown were not the only colors used. There are texts written in red or even gold, and different colors were used for illumination. For very luxurious manuscripts the whole parchment <a href="/wiki/Purple_parchment" title="Purple parchment">was colored purple</a>, and the text was written on it with gold or silver (for example, <a href="/wiki/Codex_Argenteus" title="Codex Argenteus">Codex Argenteus</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Irish monks introduced spacing between words in the 7th century. This facilitated reading, as these monks tended to be less familiar with Latin. However, the use of spaces between words did not become commonplace before the 12th century. It has been argued that the use of spacing between words shows the transition from semi-vocalized reading into silent reading.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first books used <a href="/wiki/Parchment" title="Parchment">parchment</a> or <a href="/wiki/Vellum" title="Vellum">vellum</a> (<a href="/wiki/Calfskin" title="Calfskin">calfskin</a>) for the pages. The book covers were made of wood and covered with leather. Because dried parchment tends to assume the form it had before processing, the books were fitted with clasps or straps. During the later <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, when public libraries appeared, up to the 18th century, books were often chained to a bookshelf or a <a href="/wiki/Desk" title="Desk">desk</a> to prevent theft. These chained books are called <i>libri catenati</i>.</p>
<p>At first, books were copied mostly in monasteries, one at a time. With the rise of universities in the 13th century, the <a href="/wiki/Manuscript_culture" title="Manuscript culture">Manuscript culture</a> of the time led to an increase in the demand for books, and a new system for copying books appeared. The books were divided into unbound leaves (<i>pecia</i>), which were lent out to different copyists, so the speed of book production was considerably increased. The system was maintained by secular <a href="/wiki/Stationery" title="Stationery">stationers</a> guilds, which produced both religious and non-religious material.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Judaism" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> has kept the art of the scribe alive up to the present. According to Jewish tradition, the <a href="/wiki/Torah" title="Torah">Torah</a> scroll placed in a <a href="/wiki/Synagogue" title="Synagogue">synagogue</a> must be written by hand on parchment and a printed book would not do, though the congregation may use printed prayer books and printed copies of the Scriptures are used for study outside the <a href="/wiki/Synagogue" title="Synagogue">synagogue</a>.

Yaqubi (d. 897) says that in his time Baghdad had over a hundred booksellers.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> Book shops were often situated around the town&apos;s principal mosque <sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> as in <a href="/wiki/Marrakesh" title="Marrakesh">Marrakesh</a>, <a href="/wiki/Morocco" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>, that has a street named <i>Kutubiyyin</i> or book sellers in English and the famous <a href="/wiki/Koutoubia_Mosque" title="Koutoubia Mosque">Koutoubia Mosque</a> is named so because of its location in this street.</p>
<p>The medieval <a href="/wiki/Muslim_world" title="Muslim world">Muslim world</a> also used a method of reproducing reliable copies of a book in large quantities known as <a href="/wiki/Proofreading" title="Proofreading">check reading</a>, in contrast to the traditional method of a single scribe producing only a single copy of a single manuscript. In the check reading method, only &quot;authors could authorize copies, and this was done in public sessions in which the copyist read the copy aloud in the presence of the author, who then certified it as accurate.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> With this check-reading system, &quot;an author might produce a dozen or more copies from a single reading,&quot; and with two or more readings, &quot;more than one hundred copies of a single book could easily be produced.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>By using as writing material the relatively cheap paper instead of parchment or papyrus the Muslims, in the words of Pedersen &quot;accomplished a feat of crucial significance not only to the history of the Islamic book, but also to the whole world of books&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup></p>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Woodblock_printing" title="Woodblock printing">woodblock printing</a>, a relief image of an entire page was carved into blocks of wood, inked, and used to print copies of that page.

<p>The Chinese inventor <a href="/wiki/Bi_Sheng" title="Bi Sheng">Bi Sheng</a> made <a href="/wiki/Movable_type" title="Movable type">movable type</a> of earthenware circa 1045, but there are no known surviving examples of his printing. Around 1450, in what is commonly regarded as an independent invention, <a href="/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg" title="Johannes Gutenberg">Johannes Gutenberg</a> invented movable type in Europe, along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and <a href="/wiki/Hand_mould" title="Hand mould">hand mould</a>. This invention gradually made books less expensive to produce, and more widely available.</p>
<p>Early printed books, single sheets and images which were created before 1501 in Europe are known as <a href="/wiki/Incunable" title="Incunable">incunables</a> or <i>incunabula</i>. &quot;A man born in 1453, the year of the fall of Constantinople, could look back from his fiftieth year on a lifetime in which about eight million books had been printed, more perhaps than all the scribes of Europe had produced since Constantine founded his city in A.D. 330.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup></p>

<p>Steam-powered printing presses became popular in the early 19th century. These machines could print 1,100 sheets per hour, but workers could only set 2,000 letters per hour.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

The <a href="/wiki/Bookbinding" title="Bookbinding">spine</a> of the book is an important aspect in <a href="/wiki/Book_design" title="Book design">book design</a>, especially in the cover design. When the books are stacked up or stored in a shelf, the details on the spine is the only visible surface that contains the information about the book. In stores, it is the details on the spine that attract buyers&apos; attention first.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The methods used for the printing and binding of books continued fundamentally unchanged from the 15th century into the early 20th century. While there was more <a href="/wiki/Mechanization" title="Mechanization">mechanization</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Book_printer" title="Book printer" class="mw-redirect">book printer</a> in 1900 had much in common with <a href="/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg" title="Johannes Gutenberg">Gutenberg</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Printing_press" title="Printing press">Gutenberg&apos;s invention</a> was the use of movable metal types, assembled into words, lines, and pages and then printed by <a href="/wiki/Letterpress" title="Letterpress" class="mw-redirect">letterpress</a> to create multiple copies.</p>
<p>Modern paper books are printed on <a href="/wiki/Printing_and_writing_paper" title="Printing and writing paper">papers</a> designed specifically for printed books. Traditionally, book papers are off-white or low-white papers (easier to read), are opaque to minimise the show-through of text from one side of the page to the other and are (usually) made to tighter <a href="/wiki/Caliper" title="Caliper" class="mw-redirect">caliper</a> or thickness specifications, particularly for case-bound books. Different paper qualities are used depending on the type of book: <a href="/wiki/Machine_finished_coated_paper" title="Machine finished coated paper" class="mw-redirect">Machine finished coated papers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Woodfree_uncoated_paper" title="Woodfree uncoated paper">woodfree uncoated papers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Coated_fine_paper" title="Coated fine paper" class="mw-redirect">coated fine papers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Special_fine_paper" title="Special fine paper">special fine papers</a> are common paper grades.</p>
<p>Today, the majority of books are printed by <a href="/wiki/Offset_lithography" title="Offset lithography" class="mw-redirect">offset lithography</a>.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (July 2015)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> When a book is printed the pages are laid out on the plate so that after the printed sheet is folded the pages will be in the correct sequence. Books tend to be manufactured nowadays in a few standard sizes. The <a href="/wiki/Book_size" title="Book size">sizes of books</a> are usually specified as &quot;trim size&quot;: the size of the page after the sheet has been folded and trimmed. The standard sizes result from sheet sizes (therefore machine sizes) which became popular 200 or 300 years ago, and have come to dominate the industry. British conventions in this regard prevail throughout the English-speaking world, except for the USA. The European book manufacturing industry works to a completely different set of standards.</p>

Book covers</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Some books, particularly those with shorter runs (i.e. fewer copies) will be printed on sheet-fed offset presses, but most books are now printed on web presses, which are fed by a continuous roll of paper, and can consequently print more copies in a shorter time. As the production line circulates, a complete &quot;book&quot; is collected together in one stack, next to another, and another.</p>
<p>A <b><a href="/wiki/Web_press" title="Web press" class="mw-redirect">web press</a></b> carries out the folding itself, delivering bundles of signatures (sections) ready to go into the gathering line. Notice that when the book is being printed it is being printed one (or two) signatures at a time, not one complete book at a time. Excess numbers are printed to make up for any spoilage due to &quot;make-readies&quot; or test pages to assure final print quality.</p>
<p>A <b>make-ready</b> is the preparatory work carried out by the pressmen to get the printing press up to the required quality of <a href="/wiki/Impression_(publishing)" title="Impression (publishing)" class="mw-redirect">impression</a>. Included in make-ready is the time taken to mount the plate onto the machine, clean up any mess from the previous job, and get the press up to speed. As soon as the pressman decides that the printing is correct, all the make-ready sheets will be discarded, and the press will start making books. Similar make readies take place in the folding and binding areas, each involving spoilage of paper.</p>
<p>After the signatures are folded and gathered, they move into the <b><a href="/wiki/Bindery" title="Bindery">bindery</a></b>. In the middle of last century there were still many trade binders &#x2013; stand-alone binding companies which did no printing, specializing in binding alone. At that time, because of the dominance of letterpress printing, typesetting and printing took place in one location, and binding in a different factory. When type was all metal, a typical book&apos;s worth of type would be bulky, fragile and heavy. The less it was moved in this condition the better: so printing would be carried out in the same location as the typesetting. Printed sheets on the other hand could easily be moved. Now, because of increasing <a href="/wiki/Automation" title="Automation">computerization</a> of preparing a book for the printer, the typesetting part of the job has flowed upstream, where it is done either by separately contracting companies working for the publisher, by the publishers themselves, or even by the authors. Mergers in the book manufacturing industry mean that it is now unusual to find a bindery which is not also involved in book printing (and vice versa).</p>
<p>If the book is a <a href="/wiki/Hardcover" title="Hardcover">hardback</a> its path through the bindery will involve more points of activity than if it is a <a href="/wiki/Paperback" title="Paperback">paperback</a>.</p>
<p>Unsewn binding, is now increasingly common. The signatures of a book can also be held together by &quot;Smyth sewing&quot; using needles, &quot;McCain sewing&quot;, using drilled holes often used in schoolbook binding, or &quot;notch binding&quot;, where gashes about an inch long are made at intervals through the fold in the spine of each signature. The rest of the binding process is similar in all instances. Sewn and notch bound books can be bound as either hardbacks or paperbacks.</p>

<p>&quot;Making cases&quot; happens off-line and prior to the book&apos;s arrival at the binding line. In the most basic case-making, two pieces of cardboard are placed onto a glued piece of cloth with a space between them into which is glued a thinner board cut to the width of the spine of the book. The overlapping edges of the cloth (about 5/8&quot; all round) are folded over the boards, and pressed down to adhere. After case-making the stack of cases will go to the <a href="/wiki/Foil_stamping" title="Foil stamping">foil stamping</a> area for adding decorations and type.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Digital_printing">Digital printing</span></h2>
<p>Recent developments in book manufacturing include the development of digital printing. Book pages are printed, in much the same way as an office copier works, using <a href="/wiki/Toner" title="Toner">toner</a> rather than ink. Each book is printed in one pass, not as separate signatures. Digital printing has permitted the manufacture of much smaller quantities than offset, in part because of the absence of make readies and of spoilage. One might think of a web press as printing quantities over 2000, quantities from 250 to 2000 being printed on sheet-fed presses, and digital presses doing quantities below 250. These numbers are of course only approximate and will vary from supplier to supplier, and from book to book depending on its characteristics. Digital printing has opened up the possibility of print-on-demand, where no books are printed until after an order is received from a customer.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="E-book">E-book</span></h3>

<p>The term e-book is a contraction of &quot;electronic book&quot;; it refers to a book-length publication in digital form.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> An e-book is usually made available through the internet, but also on CD-ROM and other forms. E-Books may be read either via a computer or by means of a portable book display device known as an e-book reader, such as the <a href="/wiki/Sony_Reader" title="Sony Reader">Sony Reader</a>, <a href="/wiki/Barnes_%26_Noble_Nook" title="Barnes &amp; Noble Nook">Barnes &amp; Noble Nook</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kobo_eReader" title="Kobo eReader">Kobo eReader</a>, or the <a href="/wiki/Amazon_Kindle" title="Amazon Kindle">Amazon Kindle</a>. These devices attempt to mimic the experience of reading a print book.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Information_explosion">Information explosion</span></h2>
<p>Throughout the 20th century, libraries have faced an ever-increasing rate of publishing, sometimes called an <a href="/wiki/Information_explosion" title="Information explosion">information explosion</a>. The advent of <a href="/wiki/Electronic_publishing" title="Electronic publishing">electronic publishing</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Internet" title="Internet">internet</a> means that much new information is not printed in paper books, but is made available online through a <a href="/wiki/Digital_library" title="Digital library">digital library</a>, on <a href="/wiki/CD-ROM" title="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a>, or in the form of e-books. An <a href="/wiki/On-line_book" title="On-line book" class="mw-redirect">on-line book</a> is an e-book that is available online through the internet.</p>
<p>Though many books are produced digitally, most digital versions are not available to the public, and there is no decline in the rate of paper publishing.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> There is an effort, however, to convert books that are in the <a href="/wiki/Public_domain" title="Public domain">public domain</a> into a digital medium for unlimited redistribution and infinite availability. This effort is spearheaded by <a href="/wiki/Project_Gutenberg" title="Project Gutenberg">Project Gutenberg</a> combined with <a href="/wiki/Distributed_Proofreaders" title="Distributed Proofreaders">Distributed Proofreaders</a>.</p>
<p>There have also been new developments in the process of publishing books. Technologies such as POD or &quot;<a href="/wiki/Print_on_demand" title="Print on demand">print on demand</a>&quot;, which make it possible to print as few as one book at a time, have made self-publishing much easier and more affordable. On-demand publishing has allowed publishers, by avoiding the high costs of warehousing, to keep low-selling books in print rather than declaring them out of print.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Book_design">Book design</span></h2>

<p>Book design is the art of incorporating the content, style, format, design, and sequence of the various components of a book into a coherent whole.</p>
<p>In the words of Jan Tschichold, book design &quot;though largely forgotten today, methods and rules upon which it is impossible to improve have been developed over centuries. To produce perfect books these rules have to be brought back to life and applied.&quot; Richard Hendel describes book design as &quot;an arcane subject&quot; and refers to the need for a context to understand what that means.</p>

<p>The size of a modern book is based on the printing area of a common flatbed press.

<p>Private or personal libraries made up of non-fiction and fiction books, (as opposed to the state or institutional records kept in <a href="/wiki/Archive" title="Archive">archives</a>) first appeared in <a href="/wiki/Classical_Greece" title="Classical Greece">classical Greece</a>. In ancient world the maintaining of a <a href="/wiki/Library" title="Library">library</a> was usually (but not exclusively) the privilege of a wealthy individual. These libraries could have been either private or public, i.e. for people who were interested in using them. The difference from a modern <a href="/wiki/Public_library" title="Public library">public library</a> lies in the fact that they were usually not funded from public sources. It is estimated that in the city of Rome at the end of the 3rd century there were around 30 public libraries. Public libraries also existed in other cities of the ancient <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Mediterranean_region" title="History of the Mediterranean region">Mediterranean region</a> (for example, <a href="/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria" title="Library of Alexandria">Library of Alexandria</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> Later, in the Middle Ages, monasteries and universities had also libraries that could be accessible to general public. Typically not the whole collection was available to public, the books could not be borrowed and often were chained to reading stands to prevent theft.</p>
<p>The beginning of modern public library begins around 15th century when individuals started to donate books to towns.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> The growth of a <a href="/wiki/Public_library" title="Public library">public library</a> system in the United States started in the late 19th century and was much helped by donations from <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Carnegie" title="Andrew Carnegie">Andrew Carnegie</a>. This reflected classes in a society: The poor or the middle class had to access most books through a public library or by other means while the rich could afford to have a <a href="/wiki/Private_library" title="Private library">private library</a> built in their homes. In the United States the Boston Public Library 1852 <i>Report of the Trustees</i> established the justification for the public library as a tax-supported institution intended to extend educational opportunity and provide for general culture.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>The advent of <a href="/wiki/Paperback" title="Paperback">paperback</a> books in the 20th century led to an explosion of popular publishing. Paperback books made owning books affordable for many people. Paperback books often included works from genres that had previously been published mostly in <a href="/wiki/Pulp_magazines" title="Pulp magazines" class="mw-redirect">pulp magazines</a>. As a result of the low cost of such books and the spread of bookstores filled with them (in addition to the creation of a smaller market of extremely cheap used paperbacks) owning a private library ceased to be a status symbol for the rich.</p>
<p>In library and booksellers&apos; catalogues, it is common to include an abbreviation such as &quot;Crown 8vo&quot; to indicate the <a href="/wiki/Paper_size" title="Paper size">paper size</a> from which the book is made.</p>
<p>When rows of books are lined on a book holder, <a href="/wiki/Bookend" title="Bookend">bookends</a> are sometimes needed to keep them from slanting.</p>

<p>Each book is specified by an International Standard Book Number, or <a href="/wiki/ISBN" title="ISBN" class="mw-redirect">ISBN</a>, which is unique to every edition of every book produced by participating publishers, worldwide. It is managed by the ISBN Society. An ISBN has four parts: the first part is the country code, the second the <a href="/wiki/Publisher" title="Publisher" class="mw-redirect">publisher</a> code, and the third the title code. The last part is a <a href="/wiki/Check_digit" title="Check digit">check digit</a>, and can take values from 0&#x2013;9 and X (10). The <a href="/wiki/European_Article_Number" title="European Article Number" class="mw-redirect">EAN</a> <a href="/wiki/Barcode" title="Barcode">Barcodes</a> numbers for books are derived from the ISBN by prefixing 978, for <a href="/wiki/Bookland" title="Bookland">Bookland</a>, and calculating a new check digit.</p>
<p>Commercial publishers in industrialized countries generally assign ISBNs to their books, so buyers may presume that the ISBN is part of a total international system, with no exceptions. However, many government publishers, in industrial as well as developing countries, do not participate fully in the ISBN system, and publish books which do not have ISBNs.</p>
<p>A large or public collection requires a <a href="/wiki/Library_catalog" title="Library catalog">catalogue</a>. Codes called &quot;call numbers&quot; relate the books to the catalogue, and determine their locations on the shelves. Call numbers are based on a <a href="/wiki/Library_classification" title="Library classification">Library classification</a> system. The call number is placed on the spine of the book, normally a short distance before the bottom, and inside.</p>
<p>Institutional or national standards, such as <a href="/wiki/American_National_Standards_Institute" title="American National Standards Institute">ANSI</a>/<a href="/wiki/NISO" title="NISO" class="mw-redirect">NISO</a> Z39.41 - 1997, establish the correct way to place information (such as the <a href="/wiki/Title_(publishing)" title="Title (publishing)">title</a>, or the name of the author) on book spines, and on &quot;shelvable&quot; book-like objects, such as containers for <a href="/wiki/DVD" title="DVD">DVDs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Video_tape" title="Video tape" class="mw-redirect">video tapes</a> and <a href="/wiki/Software" title="Software">software</a>.</p>

<p>Paper was first made in China as early as 200 BC, and reached Europe through <a href="/wiki/History_of_Islam" title="History of Islam">Muslim</a> territories. At first made of rags, the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_revolution" title="Industrial revolution" class="mw-redirect">industrial revolution</a> changed paper-making practices, allowing for paper to be made out of wood pulp. <a href="/wiki/Paper" title="Paper">Papermaking</a> in Europe began in the 11th century, although <a href="/wiki/Vellum" title="Vellum">vellum</a> was also common there as page material up until the beginning of 16th century, vellum being the more expensive and durable option. Printers or publishers would often issue the same publication on both materials, to cater to more than one market.</p>
<p>Paper made from <a href="/wiki/Wood_pulp" title="Wood pulp" class="mw-redirect">wood pulp</a> became popular in the early 20th century, because it was cheaper than <a href="/wiki/Linen" title="Linen">linen</a> or <a href="/wiki/Abaca" title="Abaca" class="mw-redirect">abaca</a> cloth-based papers. Pulp-based paper made books less expensive to the general public. This paved the way for huge leaps in the rate of literacy in industrialised nations, and enabled the spread of information during the <a href="/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution" title="Second Industrial Revolution">Second Industrial Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>Pulp paper, however, contains acid which eventually destroys the paper from within. Earlier techniques for making paper used <a href="/wiki/Limestone" title="Limestone">limestone</a> rollers, which neutralized the acid in the pulp. Books printed between 1850 and 1950 are primarily at risk; more recent books are often printed on acid-free or <a href="/wiki/Alkaline" title="Alkaline" class="mw-redirect">alkaline</a> paper. Libraries today have to consider <a href="/wiki/Mass_deacidification" title="Mass deacidification">mass deacidification</a> of their older collections in order to prevent decay.</p>
<p>Stability of the climate is critical to the long-term preservation of paper and book material.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> Good air circulation is important to keep fluctuation in climate stable. The <a href="/wiki/HVAC" title="HVAC">HVAC</a> system should be up to date and functioning efficiently. Light is detrimental to collections. Therefore, care should be given to the collections by implementing light control. General housekeeping issues can be addressed, including <a href="/wiki/Pest_control" title="Pest control">pest control</a>. In addition to these helpful solutions, a library must also make an effort to be prepared if a disaster occurs, one that they cannot control. Time and effort should be given to create a concise and effective disaster plan to counteract any damage incurred through &quot;acts of god&quot; therefore an <a href="/wiki/Emergency_management" title="Emergency management">emergency management</a> plan should be in place.</p>
