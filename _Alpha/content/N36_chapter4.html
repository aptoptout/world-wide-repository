The Farage name comes from a distant <a href="/wiki/Huguenot" title="Huguenot">Huguenot</a> ancestor. One of his great-grandfathers was born to German parents who migrated to London in the 19th century. His grandfather, Private Harry Farage, fought in <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> and was wounded near <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Vimy_Ridge" title="Battle of Vimy Ridge">Vimy Ridge</a> at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Arras_(1917)" title="Battle of Arras (1917)">Arras</a>.

A 2012 <a href="/wiki/BBC_Radio_4" title="BBC Radio 4">BBC Radio 4</a> profile described Guy Farage as an alcoholic who left the family home when Nigel was five years old.</p><p>Farage was educated at <a href="/wiki/Dulwich_College" title="Dulwich College">Dulwich College</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Public_school_(United_Kingdom)" title="Public school (United Kingdom)">independent school</a> with a wide social mix in south London, and in his autobiography he pays tribute to the careers advice he received there from England <a href="/wiki/Test_cricket" title="Test cricket">Test cricketer</a> <a href="/wiki/John_Dewes" title="John Dewes">John Dewes</a>, &quot;who must have spotted that I was quite ballsy, probably good on a platform, unafraid of the limelight, a bit noisy and good at selling things&quot;. On leaving school in 1982, he decided not to go to university, but to work in the City, trading commodities at the <a href="/wiki/London_Metal_Exchange" title="London Metal Exchange">London Metal Exchange</a>. Initially, he joined the American commodity operation of <a href="/wiki/Broker" title="Broker">brokerage</a> firm <a href="/wiki/Drexel_Burnham_Lambert" title="Drexel Burnham Lambert">Drexel Burnham Lambert</a>, transferring to <a href="/wiki/Credit_Lyonnais" class="mw-redirect" title="Credit Lyonnais">Credit Lyonnais Rouse</a> in 1986. He joined <a href="/wiki/Refco" title="Refco">Refco</a> in 1994, and <a href="/wiki/Natixis" title="Natixis">Natexis Metals</a> in 2003.</p><p>Farage was active in the <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative Party</a> from his school days, having seen a visit to his school by <a href="/wiki/Enoch_Powell" title="Enoch Powell">Enoch Powell</a> and <a href="/wiki/Keith_Joseph" title="Keith Joseph">Keith Joseph</a>. However, he voted for the <a href="/wiki/Green_Party_(UK)" title="Green Party (UK)">Green Party</a> in <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_1989_(United_Kingdom)" title="European Parliament election, 1989 (United Kingdom)">1989</a> because of what he saw as their then &quot;sensible&quot; and <a href="/wiki/Euroscepticism" title="Euroscepticism">Eurosceptic</a> policies. He left the Conservatives in 1992 in protest at Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/John_Major" title="John Major">John Major</a> government&apos;s signing of the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_on_European_Union" title="Treaty on European Union">Treaty on European Union</a> at <a href="/wiki/Maastricht" title="Maastricht">Maastricht</a>. He was a founding member of <a href="/wiki/UK_Independence_Party" title="UK Independence Party">UKIP</a> in 1993.</p><p>Farage was elected to the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a> in <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_1999_(United_Kingdom)" title="European Parliament election, 1999 (United Kingdom)">1999</a> and re-elected in <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_2004_(United_Kingdom)" title="European Parliament election, 2004 (United Kingdom)">2004</a>, <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_2009_(United_Kingdom)" title="European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)">2009</a> and <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_2014_(United_Kingdom)" title="European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)">2014</a>. In 1999 the BBC spent four months filming a documentary about his European election campaign but did not air it. Farage, then head of the UKIP&apos;s South East office, asked for a video and had friends make copies which were sold for &#xA3;5 through the UKIP&apos;s magazine. Surrey Trading Standards investigated and Farage admitted the offence. Farage is presently the leader of the 24-member UKIP contingent in the European Parliament, and co-leader of the multinational Eurosceptic group, <a href="/wiki/Europe_of_Freedom_and_Direct_Democracy" title="Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy">Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy</a>. Farage was ranked the fifth most influential MEP by <a href="/wiki/Politico" title="Politico">Politico</a> in 2016, who described him as, &quot;one of the two most effective speakers in the chamber.&quot;</p><p>On 18 November 2004, Farage announced in the European Parliament that <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Barrot" title="Jacques Barrot">Jacques Barrot</a>, when French Commissioner-designate, had been barred from elected office in France for 2 years, after being convicted in 2000 of embezzling &#xA3;2 million from government funds and diverting it into the coffers of his party. He said that French President <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Chirac" title="Jacques Chirac">Jacques Chirac</a> had granted Barrot amnesty and initial BBC reports said that, under French Law, it was perhaps illegal to mention that conviction; the prohibition in question applies only to French officials in the course of their duties. The President of the Parliament, <a href="/wiki/Josep_Borrell" title="Josep Borrell">Josep Borrell</a>, enjoined him to retract his comments under threat of &quot;legal consequences&quot;. The following day it was confirmed that Barrot had received an 8-month suspended jail sentence in the case, and that this had been quickly expunged by the amnesty decided by Chirac and his parliamentary majority. The Socialist and Liberal groups in the European Parliament then joined forces with UKIP in demanding the resignation of Barrot for failing to disclose the conviction during his confirmation hearings.</p><p>In early 2005, Farage requested that the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a> disclose where the individual Commissioners had spent their holidays. The Commission did not provide the information requested, on the basis that the Commissioners had a right of privacy. The German newspaper <i><a href="/wiki/Die_Welt" title="Die Welt">Die Welt</a></i> reported that the President of the European Commission, <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Manuel_Barroso" title="Jos&#xE9; Manuel Barroso">Jos&#xE9; Manuel Barroso</a> had spent a week on the yacht of the Greek shipping billionaire <a href="/wiki/Spiros_Latsis" title="Spiros Latsis">Spiros Latsis</a>. It emerged soon afterwards that this had occurred a month before the Commission under Barroso&apos;s predecessor <a href="/wiki/Romano_Prodi" title="Romano Prodi">Romano Prodi</a> approved 10.3 million euro of Greek state aid for Latsis&apos; shipping company. It also became known that <a href="/wiki/Peter_Mandelson" title="Peter Mandelson">Peter Mandelson</a>, then the British <a href="/wiki/EU_Commissioner" class="mw-redirect" title="EU Commissioner">EU Commissioner</a>, had accepted a trip to Jamaica from an unrevealed source.</p><p>Farage persuaded around 75 <a href="/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament" title="Member of the European Parliament">MEPs</a> from across the political divide to back a motion of no confidence in Barroso, which would be sufficient to compel Barroso to appear before the European Parliament to be questioned on the issue. The motion was successfully tabled on 12 May 2005, and Barroso appeared before Parliament at a debate on 26 May 2005. The motion was heavily defeated. A Conservative MEP, <a href="/wiki/Roger_Helmer" title="Roger Helmer">Roger Helmer</a>, was expelled from his group, the <a href="/wiki/European_People%27s_Party_(European_Parliament_group)" class="mw-redirect" title="European People&apos;s Party (European Parliament group)">European People&apos;s Party &#x2013; European Democrats</a> (EPP-ED), in the middle of the debate by that group&apos;s leader <a href="/wiki/Hans-Gert_Poettering" class="mw-redirect" title="Hans-Gert Poettering">Hans-Gert Poettering</a> as a result of his support for Farage&apos;s motion.</p><p>On 12 September 2006, Farage was <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_Independence_Party_leadership_election,_2006" class="mw-redirect" title="United Kingdom Independence Party leadership election, 2006">elected leader of UKIP</a> with 45% of the vote, 20 <a href="/wiki/Percentage_point" title="Percentage point">percentage points</a> ahead of his nearest rival. He pledged to bring discipline to the party and to maximise UKIP&apos;s representation in local, parliamentary and other elections. In a <i><a href="/wiki/PM_(Radio_4)" class="mw-redirect" title="PM (Radio 4)">PM</a></i> programme interview on <a href="/wiki/BBC_Radio_4" title="BBC Radio 4">BBC Radio 4</a> that day he pledged to end the public perception of UKIP as a single-issue party and to work with allied politicians in the <a href="/wiki/Better_Off_Out" title="Better Off Out">Better Off Out</a> campaign, committing himself not to stand against the MPs who have signed up to that campaign.</p><p>In his maiden speech to the UKIP conference, on 8 October 2006, Farage told delegates that the party was &quot;at the centre-ground of British public opinion&quot; and the &quot;real voice of opposition&quot;. He said: &quot;We&apos;ve got three <a href="/wiki/Social_democratic" class="mw-redirect" title="Social democratic">social democratic</a> parties in Britain &#x2013; Labour, Lib Dem and Conservative are virtually indistinguishable from each other on nearly all the main issues&quot; and &quot;you can&apos;t put a cigarette paper between them and that is why there are nine million people who don&apos;t vote now in general elections that did back in 1992.&quot;</p><p>At 10pm on 19 October 2006, Farage took part in a three-hour live interview and phone-in with <a href="/wiki/James_Whale_(radio)" title="James Whale (radio)">James Whale</a> on the national radio station <a href="/wiki/TalkSPORT" class="mw-redirect" title="TalkSPORT">talkSPORT</a>. Four days later, Whale announced on his show his intention to stand as UKIP&apos;s candidate in the <a href="/wiki/London_mayoral_election,_2008" title="London mayoral election, 2008">2008 London Mayoral Election</a>. Farage said that Whale &quot;not only has guts, but an understanding of what real people think&quot;. Whale later decided not to stand and UKIP was represented by <a href="/wiki/Gerard_Batten" title="Gerard Batten">Gerard Batten</a>.</p><p>Farage stood again for the UKIP leadership in 2010 (having stood down the year before, to focus on his unsuccessful campaign in the Buckingham election) after his successor <a href="/wiki/Malcolm_Pearson,_Baron_Pearson_of_Rannoch" title="Malcolm Pearson, Baron Pearson of Rannoch">Lord Pearson</a> had stood down, and on 5 November 2010 it was announced he had won the leadership contest.</p><p>In May 2014 Farage led the UKIP to win the EU Election with 4,376,635 votes, the first time a UK political party other than Labour or Conservatives had won a national election in over 100 years. Farage was returned as MEP for the South East region, a seat he has represented since 1999.</p><p>As an MEP Farage leads the <a href="/wiki/Europe_of_Freedom_and_Direct_Democracy" title="Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy">Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy</a> grouping in the European Parliament.</p><p>On 8 May 2015, Farage resigned as leader of UKIP after he failed to win the seat of <a href="/wiki/South_Thanet_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="South Thanet (UK Parliament constituency)">Thanet South</a> in the general election held the previous day, although he kept open the possibility of re-entering the ensuing leadership contest. In his autobiography, <i>The Purple Revolution</i>, he had written:</p><p>It is frankly just not credible for me to continue to lead the party without a Westminster seat. [&#x2026;] Was I supposed to brief Ukip policy from the Westminster Arms? No &#x2013; if I fail to win South Thanet, it is curtains for me. I will have to step down.</p><p>On 11 May it was announced that Farage would continue to serve as the party&#x2019;s leader, with the BBC reporting: &quot;Party chairman Steve Crowther said the national executive committee believed the election campaign had been a &#x2018;great success&#x2019; and members had &#x2018;unanimously&#x2019; rejected Mr Farage&apos;s letter of resignation&quot;. Interviewed about his continued leadership by the BBC the following day, Farage said: &quot;I resigned. I said I&apos;d resign. I turned up to the NEC meeting with letter in hand fully intending to carry that through. They unanimously said they didn&apos;t want me to do that, they presented me with petitions, signatures, statements from candidates saying it would be a bad thing for UKIP. So I left the meeting, went and sat in darkened room to think about what to do, and decided for the interest of the party I would accept their kind offer for me to stay and tear up the letter.&quot; He added that he would consider standing for parliament again should a by-election be called in a Labour-held seat.</p><p>Farage had unsuccessfully contested British parliamentary elections for UKIP five times, both before and after his election as an <a href="/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament" title="Member of the European Parliament">MEP</a> in 1999. Under the 2002 European Union decision to forbid MEPs from holding a <a href="/wiki/Dual_mandate" title="Dual mandate">dual mandate</a>, if he were to be elected to the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="House of Commons of the United Kingdom">House of Commons</a>, he would have to resign his seat as MEP.</p><p>When he contested the <a href="/wiki/Bromley_and_Chislehurst_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="Bromley and Chislehurst (UK Parliament constituency)">Bromley &amp; Chislehurst</a> constituency in a <a href="/wiki/Bromley_and_Chislehurst_by-election,_2006" title="Bromley and Chislehurst by-election, 2006">May 2006 by-election</a>, following the death of Eurosceptic Conservative MP <a href="/wiki/Eric_Forth" title="Eric Forth">Eric Forth</a>, Farage came third, winning 8% of the vote, beating the Labour Party candidate. This was the second-best by-election result recorded by UKIP out of 25 results, and the first time since the <a href="/wiki/Liverpool_Walton_by-election,_1991" title="Liverpool Walton by-election, 1991">Liverpool Walton by-election</a> in 1991 that a party in government had been pushed into fourth place in a parliamentary by-election on mainland Britain.</p><p>In January 2007, the French farmers&apos; leader <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Daul" title="Joseph Daul">Joseph Daul</a> was elected to lead the <a href="/wiki/European_People%27s_Party%E2%80%93European_Democrats" class="mw-redirect" title="European People&apos;s Party&#x2013;European Democrats">European People&apos;s Party&#x2013;European Democrats</a> (EPP-ED), the European Parliamentary grouping which then included the British Conservatives. UKIP almost immediately revealed that Daul had been under judicial investigation in France since 2004 as part of an inquiry into the alleged misuse of public funds worth &#x20AC;16 million (&#xA3;10.6 million) by French farming unions.&quot; It was not suggested that Daul had personally benefited, but was accused of &quot;complicity and concealment of the abuse of public funds.&quot; Daul accused Farage of publicising the investigation for political reasons and threatened to sue Farage, but did not do so though the court dropped all charges against him.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Charles,_Prince_of_Wales" title="Charles, Prince of Wales">Charles, Prince of Wales</a> was invited to speak to the European Parliament on 14 February 2008; in his speech he called for EU leadership in the battle against <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a>. During the standing ovation that followed, Farage was the only MEP to remain seated, and he went on to describe the Prince&apos;s advisers as &quot;na&#xEF;ve and foolish at best.&quot; Farage continued: &quot;How can somebody like Prince Charles be allowed to come to the European Parliament at this time to announce he thinks it should have more powers? It would have been better for the country he wants to rule one day if he had stayed home and tried to persuade <a href="/wiki/Gordon_Brown" title="Gordon Brown">Gordon Brown</a> to give the people the promised referendum on the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Lisbon" title="Treaty of Lisbon">Treaty of Lisbon</a>.&quot; The leader of the UK <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a>&apos;s MEPs, <a href="/wiki/Gary_Titley" title="Gary Titley">Gary Titley</a>, accused Farage of anti-Royalism. Titley said: &quot;I was embarrassed and disgusted when the Leader of the UK Independence Party, Nigel Farage, remained firmly seated during the lengthy standing ovation Prince Charles received. I had not realised Mr Farage&apos;s blind adherence to <a href="/wiki/Right-wing_politics" title="Right-wing politics">right-wing politics</a> involved disloyalty and discourtesy to the <a href="/wiki/British_Royal_Family" title="British Royal Family">Royal Family</a>. He should be thoroughly ashamed of himself and should apologise to the British people he represents.&quot;</p><p>In May 2009, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Observer" title="The Observer">The Observer</a></i> reported a Foreign Press Association speech given by Farage in which he had said that over his period as a Member of the European Parliament he had received a total of &#xA3;2 million of taxpayers&apos; money in staff, travel, and other expenses. In response, Farage said that in future all UKIP MEPs would provide monthly expense details.</p><p>After the speech of <a href="/wiki/Herman_Van_Rompuy" title="Herman Van Rompuy">Herman Van Rompuy</a> on 24 February 2010 to the European Parliament, Farage &#x2013; to protests from other MEPs &#x2013; addressed the former <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Belgium" title="Prime Minister of Belgium">Belgian Prime Minister</a> and first long-term <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_European_Council" title="President of the European Council">President of the European Council</a> saying that he had the &quot;charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of low grade bank clerk.&quot; Farage questioned the legitimacy of Van Rompuy&apos;s appointment, asking &quot;Who are you? I&apos;d never heard of you, nobody in Europe had ever heard of you.&quot; He also asserted that Van Rompuy&apos;s &quot;intention [is] to be the quiet assassin of European democracy and of the European nation states.&quot; Van Rompuy commented afterwards, &quot;There was one contribution that I can only hold in contempt, but I&apos;m not going to comment further.&quot; After refusing to apologise for behaviour that was, in the words of the <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_European_Parliament" title="President of the European Parliament">President of the European Parliament</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jerzy_Buzek" title="Jerzy Buzek">Jerzy Buzek</a>, &quot;inappropriate, unparliamentary and insulting to the dignity of the House&quot;, Farage was reprimanded and had his right to ten days&apos; allowance (expenses) &quot;docked.&quot;</p><p>Buzek said after his meeting with Farage:</p><p>I defend absolutely Mr Farage&apos;s right to disagree about the policy or institutions of the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">Union</a>, but not to personally insult our guests in the European Parliament or the country from which they may come. [. . .] I myself fought for free speech as the absolute cornerstone of a democratic society. But with freedom comes responsibility &#x2013; in this case, to respect the dignity of others and of our institutions. I am disappointed by Mr Farage&apos;s behaviour, which sits ill with the great parliamentary tradition of his own country. I cannot accept this sort of behaviour in the European Parliament. I invited him to apologise, but he declined to do so. I have therefore &#x2013; as an expression of the seriousness of the matter &#x2013; rescinded his right to ten days&apos; daily allowance as a Member.</p><p>Questioned by <a href="/wiki/Camilla_Long" title="Camilla Long">Camilla Long</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Times" title="The Times">The Times</a></i>, Farage described his speech: &quot;it wasn&apos;t abusive, it was right.&quot;</p><p>On 4 September 2009, Farage resigned as the UKIP&apos;s leader to focus on his campaign to become Member of Parliament for <a href="/wiki/Buckingham_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="Buckingham (UK Parliament constituency)">Buckingham</a> at <a href="/wiki/British_Parliament" class="mw-redirect" title="British Parliament">Westminster</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010" title="United Kingdom general election, 2010">2010 general election</a>.

Farage suffered injuries that were described as non-life-threatening. Although his injuries were originally described as minor, his <a href="/wiki/Human_sternum" class="mw-redirect" title="Human sternum">sternum</a> and ribs were broken and his lung punctured.

He was also charged with threatening to kill an AAIB official involved in the investigation into the accident. In April 2011, the pilot was found guilty of making death threats. The judge said that the defendant was &quot;clearly extremely disturbed&quot; at the time the offences happened, adding &quot;He is a man who does need help.

Interviewed the following Sunday by <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Neil" title="Andrew Neil">Andrew Neil</a> and asked about &quot;the game plan&quot;, Farage welcomed the &quot;average 13% vote&quot; across the country, and stated that the party was preparing for county council elections in 2013, <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_2014" title="European Parliament election, 2014">European elections in 2014</a> and a general election in 2015.</p><p>Asked what would happen to UKIP if the Conservatives made a manifesto commitment to a European Referendum, Farage said they had already failed to honour a &quot;cast iron&quot; commitment for a <a href="/wiki/Referendum" title="Referendum">referendum</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Lisbon_Treaty" class="mw-redirect" title="Lisbon Treaty">Lisbon Treaty</a>. Challenging Farage&apos;s viewpoint, Neil said that UKIP aspired to come top of the European elections, but while UKIP wanted to join the big time they were still seen as &quot;unprofessional, amateur and even unacceptable.&quot; In an interview, Farage described <a href="/wiki/Sayeeda_Warsi,_Baroness_Warsi" title="Sayeeda Warsi, Baroness Warsi">Baroness Warsi</a> as &quot;the lowest grade Chairman the Tory Party has ever had.&quot; He was voted politician of the year by the <a href="/wiki/Online_service_provider" title="Online service provider">online service</a> <a href="/wiki/MSN" title="MSN">MSN</a>.</p><p>In May 2012 Farage was interviewed by Karen Coleman of the <i><a href="/wiki/Irish_Independent" title="Irish Independent">Irish Independent</a></i> about the campaign in Ireland against the <a href="/wiki/Thirtieth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_Ireland" title="Thirtieth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland">Irish fiscal treaty</a>.

The party received 23% of the vote in the local elections, winning 147 council seats, and placing it only 2 points behind the governing Conservative party and 9 points ahead of the Liberal Democrats. Farage was mobbed by well-wishers as he made his way to his favourite pub, the Marquis of Granby, for a celebratory drink. He called the victory &quot;a real sea change in British politics&quot;. Subsequently, polling agency Survation found that 22% of voters intended to support UKIP in the 2015 General Election.</p><p>In May 2013, Farage was interrupted by protesters during a press conference in the Canon&apos;s Gait pub on Edinburgh&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Royal_Mile" title="Royal Mile">Royal Mile</a>. The demonstration was organised by groups including the <a href="/wiki/Radical_Independence_Campaign" title="Radical Independence Campaign">Radical Independence Campaign</a> and saw protesters vocally accuse Farage of being &quot;racist&quot;, &quot;fascist&quot;, and a &quot;homophobe&quot;, and tell him to &quot;go back to London&quot;. Farage made attempts to leave by taxi but was prevented from doing so, and was eventually taken away in an armoured police van while protesters continued to shout. He was trying to raise the profile of UKIP in Scotland ahead of the <a href="/wiki/Aberdeen_Donside_by-election,_2013" title="Aberdeen Donside by-election, 2013">Aberdeen Donside by-election</a>; the party at that point had no representation in the country, and took 0.91% of the vote in the previous election though it won its first Scottish MEP the following year. During an interview with BBC&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/Good_Morning_Scotland" title="Good Morning Scotland">Good Morning Scotland</a></i> radio show, Farage labelled the protesters &quot;yobbo fascist scum&quot; before hanging up, stating that the questions regarding the incident in Edinburgh were insulting and unpleasant.</p><p>In a second visit to Edinburgh in May 2014 Farage correctly predicted that UKIP would win a Scottish seat in the elections. Two hundred protesters heckled and booed him.

The Electoral Commission said that the gifts should have been also declared in the UK within 30 days of receipt, and then stated they were considering whether to take action against him after they reviewed all necessary information supplied to them.</p><p>In October 2013, Farage announced on the BBC&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Andrew_Marr_Show" title="The Andrew Marr Show">The Andrew Marr Show</a></i> that he would stand for election as an <a href="/wiki/Member_of_Parliament" class="mw-redirect" title="Member of Parliament">MP</a> at the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2015" title="United Kingdom general election, 2015">United Kingdom general election, 2015</a>, most likely contesting either <a href="/wiki/Folkestone_and_Hythe_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="Folkestone and Hythe (UK Parliament constituency)">Folkestone and Hythe</a> or <a href="/wiki/South_Thanet_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="South Thanet (UK Parliament constituency)">South Thanet</a>; meanwhile he stated that his duty and preference was to focus on his current role as an <a href="/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament" title="Member of the European Parliament">MEP</a>.</p><p>In August 2014 Farage was selected as the UKIP <a href="/wiki/Prospective_parliamentary_candidate" title="Prospective parliamentary candidate">candidate</a> for <a href="/wiki/South_Thanet_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="South Thanet (UK Parliament constituency)">South Thanet</a> following local <a href="/wiki/Husting" title="Husting">hustings</a>.

UKIP indicated that it would consider taking legal action were the <a href="/wiki/Political_party" title="Political party">party</a> excluded, in contravention of established <a href="/wiki/Broadcast_media" class="mw-redirect" title="Broadcast media">broadcast media</a> rules, from televised Party Leaders&apos; debates in advance of the 2015 General Election. The 7-way <a href="/wiki/Leaders%27_debate" title="Leaders&apos; debate">leaders&apos; TV debate</a> was broadcast by ITV on 2 April 2015 from <a href="/wiki/MediaCityUK" title="MediaCityUK">MediaCityUK</a>, <a href="/wiki/Salford_Quays" title="Salford Quays">Salford Quays</a>. Of three polls taken immediately afterwards, the <a href="/wiki/ComRes" title="ComRes">ComRes</a> poll had Farage as joint winner, alongside Labour&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Ed_Miliband" title="Ed Miliband">Ed Miliband</a> and Conservative <a href="/wiki/David_Cameron" title="David Cameron">David Cameron</a>.</p><p>In March 2015, Farage declared in his book <i>The Purple Revolution</i> that he would step down as UKIP leader should he not be elected as an MP; he stated his belief that it would not be &quot;credible&quot; for him to lead UKIP without sitting in <a href="/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="House of Commons of the United Kingdom">parliament at Westminster</a>.</p><p>On 22 March 2015, Farage was targeted by anti-UKIP activists who chased him and his family from a <a href="/wiki/Pub_lunch" class="mw-redirect" title="Pub lunch">pub lunch</a> in <a href="/wiki/Downe" title="Downe">Downe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kent" title="Kent">Kent</a>. His daughters ran away to hide and were later found to be safe. Farage, when asked what he thought about the incident, called the protesters &quot;scum&quot;.</p><p>Farage was unsuccessful in his bid to become MP for <a href="/wiki/South_Thanet_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="South Thanet (UK Parliament constituency)">South Thanet</a> and announced his resignation as the leader of UKIP, citing that he is a &quot;man of his word&quot; since he promised to resign if he did not win his seat. However, on 11 May 2015, the party chairman said they would not accept Mr Farage&apos;s post-election resignation because the party&apos;s &quot;election campaign had been a great success&quot;.</p><p>A row subsequently developed within the party, in which MEP and campaign chief <a href="/wiki/Patrick_O%27Flynn" title="Patrick O&apos;Flynn">Patrick O&apos;Flynn</a> described Farage&apos;s public image as &apos;snarling, thin-skinned, aggressive&apos; and claimed he risked turning the party into a &apos;<a href="/wiki/Personality_cult" class="mw-redirect" title="Personality cult">personality cult</a>&apos;. O&apos;Flynn accused Farage of paying too much attention to advisors that &apos;would like to take UKIP in the direction of some hard-right, ultra-aggressive American Tea Party-type movement&apos;, singling out the <a href="/wiki/National_Health_Service_(England)" title="National Health Service (England)">NHS</a> and gun control liberalisation as particular issues. Raheem Kassam, Farage&apos;s chief of staff was later sacked as a result, whilst O&apos;Flynn insisted he continued to support Farage as party leader Farage also faced a number of calls from senior figures within the party to stand down.<br></p><p>Following the election a UKIP spokesman acknowledged that after a series of threatening attacks on Farage it had sent an informant into the Thanet branch of the protest organisation Stand Up to UKIP, stating &quot;in order to provide reasonable security it was of course necessary to have information from the inside&quot;, an approach he said was used by &quot;a great many security operations tasked with protecting the safety and wellbeing of a targeted individual.&quot; According to <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i>, the informant is alleged to have actively encouraged members to commit criminal damage. Farage had said he was the victim of &quot;trade union-funded activists&quot; who were inciting vandalism.</p><p>In January 2016 Farage told <i><a href="/wiki/The_Mail_on_Sunday" title="The Mail on Sunday">The Mail on Sunday</a></i> that he believed his car had been tampered with in October 2015, as he had been forced to stop when his car&apos;s wheel nuts came loose. He reported that he had spoken with the <a href="/wiki/National_Police_(France)" title="National Police (France)">French police</a> but did not wish to pursue the matter any further. <i><a href="/wiki/The_Times" title="The Times">The Times</a></i>, however, said Farage&apos;s story was untrue, and that <a href="/wiki/Dunkirk" title="Dunkirk">Dunkirk</a> prosecutors had no reason to suspect foul play or the police would have started an investigation. The owner of the breakdown garage concerned had said the problem was probably shoddy repair work, but he had been unable to communicate directly with Farage. Farage later said he had made a &quot;terrible, terrible mistake&quot; in speaking to journalists and that a Sunday newspaper had wrongly turned his claims of tampering into an assassination attempt.</p><p>Although previously denouncing <a href="/wiki/Tax_avoidance" title="Tax avoidance">tax avoidance</a> in a speech to the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a>, in which he attacked European bureaucrats who earned &#xA3;100,000 a year and paid 12% tax under EU rules, Farage admitted in 2013 to hiring a tax advisor to set up the Farage Family Educational Trust 1654, a trust Farage claimed to be used &quot;for inheritance purposes&quot;, on the <a href="/wiki/Isle_of_Man" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a>. Farage later described this &quot;as standard practice&quot;, but insisted he &quot;decided I didn&apos;t want it. I never ever used it. The Isle of Man is not a tax haven.&quot; Farage has since claimed that this was a mistake, in part because it cost him too much money, but has criticised the political discourse surrounding tax avoidance as a &quot;<a href="/wiki/Race_to_the_bottom" title="Race to the bottom">race to the bottom</a>&quot;. The <a href="/wiki/BBC" title="BBC">BBC</a> noted that &quot;The Isle of Man was one of the UK&apos;s crown dependencies which signed an agreement on corporate disclosure at a recent meeting with David Cameron amid claims that individuals and firms are using offshore locations to reduce their tax liabilities&quot;, adding that the Isle of Man rejects any allegations that they are used for the purpose of tax avoidance.</p><p>In contrast to the majority of comments from British political leaders, Farage has said that most legal <a href="/wiki/Tax_avoidance" title="Tax avoidance">tax avoidance</a> was &quot;okay&quot; after he was questioned on why &#xA3;45,000 of his income was paid into his private company rather than a personal bank account, saying that criticism of his actions was &quot;ridiculous&quot;. In the wake of the <a href="/wiki/Panama_Papers" title="Panama Papers">Panama Papers</a> leak, Farage also said that the possibility of him releasing his tax return was a &quot;big no&quot; as &quot;I think in this country what people earn is regarded as a private matter&quot;, and criticised David Cameron for being hypocritical, especially with regards to his past comments about <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Carr" title="Jimmy Carr">Jimmy Carr</a>&apos;s tax avoidance.</p><p>Farage was a key figurehead for the <a href="/wiki/Brexit" class="mw-redirect" title="Brexit">British exit from the EU</a> in 2016. Polls on the day of the vote suggested defeat for the leave campaign, though they were successful with 52% of the vote. <a href="/wiki/Jean-Claude_Juncker" title="Jean-Claude Juncker">Jean-Claude Juncker</a> promptly told all UKIP members to leave the Parliament.</p><p>On 28 June 2016 Farage made a speech in the European Parliament claiming that a hypothetical failure for the EU to forge a trade deal with an exited UK would be &quot;be far worse for you than it would be for us&quot; to heckling and laughing by Parliament members. He insulted his fellow MEPs, claiming that &quot;virtually none&quot; of them had ever had done &quot;a proper job&quot; in their lives. Media around the world covered Farage&apos;s speech, including his comment: &quot;... when I came here 17 years ago, and I said that I wanted to lead a campaign to get Britain to leave the European Union, you all laughed at me. Well I have to say, you&apos;re not laughing now are you?&quot; and his prediction that Britain will not be the only country to leave the EU. In response, <a href="/wiki/Guy_Verhofstadt" title="Guy Verhofstadt">Guy Verhofstadt</a> compared Farage&apos;s referendum posters with Nazi propaganda and credited the Brexit campaign with causing a multi-billion loss in the stock exchange. Explicitly addressing Farage, Verhofstadt added &#x201C;.. Ok. Let&#x2019;s be positive. Finally, we&#x2019;re going to get rid of the biggest waste in the budget of the (European) Union, that we have paid for 17 years, your salary.&#x201D;  <a href="/wiki/Vytenis_Andriukaitis" title="Vytenis Andriukaitis">Vytenis Andriukaitis</a>, the <a href="/wiki/European_Commissioner_for_Health_and_Food_Safety" title="European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety">European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety</a>, and a former <a href="/wiki/Cardiothoracic_surgery" title="Cardiothoracic surgery">cardiac surgeon</a>, later responded to the speech, criticising Farage for spreading &#x201C;toxic untruths&#x201D; and &#x201C;lies&#x201D; such as the claim that, after Brexit, the money formerly contributed by Britain to the EU budget would be invested in healthcare.</p><p>From taking office as a UKIP <a href="/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament" title="Member of the European Parliament">MEP</a> in 1999, Farage has often voiced opposition to the &quot;<a href="/wiki/Euro" title="Euro">euro</a> project&quot;. His argument is that &quot;a one-size-fits-all interest rate&quot; cannot work for countries with structurally different economies, often using the example of Greece and Germany to emphasise contrast.</p><p>Farage strongly opposes the use of <a href="/wiki/Bailout" title="Bailout">bailouts</a> and says that &quot;buying your own debt with tax payers money&quot; will not solve the problem and that, &quot;if we do, the next debt crisis won&apos;t be a country...it will be the <a href="/wiki/European_Central_Bank" title="European Central Bank">European Central Bank</a> itself&quot;.</p><p>On the issue of welfare, Farage wants migrants to live in the UK for five years before being able to claim benefits, and for them to be ineligible for tax credits. He believes that tax avoidance is caused by &quot;punitive tax rates&quot;, and wants &quot;fairer&quot; taxes as a way to prevent it.</p><p>Farage declared himself personally in favour of the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_Alternative_Vote_referendum,_2011" title="United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011">Alternative Vote system</a> of May 2011, saying first-past-the-post would be a &quot;nightmare&quot; for UKIP. The party&apos;s stance has to be decided by its central policy-making committee, although Farage has personally expressed a preference for the <a href="/wiki/AV%2B" class="mw-redirect" title="AV+">AV+</a> system as it &quot;would retain the constituency link and then also the second ballot ensured there were no wasted votes&quot;. After the 2015 general election, in which UKIP took a lower proportion of seats than votes, Farage called the <a href="/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting" title="First-past-the-post voting">first-past-the-post voting</a> system (FPTP) &quot;totally bankrupt&quot;, although Farage claims &quot;I completely lost faith in [FPTP] <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2005" title="United Kingdom general election, 2005">in 2005</a> when Blair was returned with a 60 seat majority on 36 per cent of the vote, or 22 per cent if you factor in low turnout.&quot;</p><p>Farage has criticised the shutting down of coal-fired power stations and has opposed the policy of creating wind farms as covering &quot;Britain in ugly disgusting ghastly windmills&quot;. In a speech made to the European parliament on 11 September 2013, Farage cited news, reported in several <a href="/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch" title="Rupert Murdoch">Rupert Murdoch</a>-owned papers and the <i><a href="/wiki/Daily_Mail" title="Daily Mail">Daily Mail</a></i>, that the Arctic Sea ice cap had apparently grown from 2012 to 2013, claiming that this was evidence of decades &quot;of Euro-federalism combined with an increasing Green obsession&quot;.</p><p>Farage takes an anti-prohibitionist position on recreational drugs. In an April 2014 phone-in interview hosted by <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> he argued that the <a href="/wiki/War_on_Drugs" title="War on Drugs">War on Drugs</a> had been lost &quot;many, many years ago&quot;, stating that &quot;I hate drugs, I&apos;ve never taken them myself, I hope I never do, but I just have a feeling that the criminalisation of all these drugs is actually not really helping British society.&quot; He argued in favour of a <a href="/wiki/Royal_Commission" title="Royal Commission">Royal Commission</a> on drugs exploring all avenues as how to most effectively legislate on drugs and deal with their related criminal and public health problems, including the possibility of their <a href="/wiki/Drug_liberalization" title="Drug liberalization">legalisation</a>.</p><p>According to Farage, the smoking ban in enclosed public spaces is &quot;silly and illiberal&quot;, he recommends separate smoking areas along the lines of some German states. He believes that banning things makes them more attractive to children, and said that &quot;Obesity is killing more people than smoking, you could ban chip shops, you could ban doughnuts. The point is we are big enough and ugly enough to make our own decisions&quot;.</p><p>In his 2015 book, Farage reflected that based on his experiences, &quot;the NHS is so over-stretched that if you can afford private health care, you should take it, particularly for diagnostics and preventative medicine. In the NHS, the system is so battered and poorly run that unless you are really lucky, you will fall through the cracks. The NHS is, however, astonishingly good at critical care. But what testicular cancer taught me is that the NHS will probably let you down if you need screening, fast diagnosis and an operation at a time that suits you&quot;. He supports reform within the NHS, saying that its resources have become stretched due to increased immigration, and blaming Labour for high costs of new hospitals built through private finance initiatives.</p><p>Farage says that money which the NHS could spend on treating taxpayers with serious conditions is instead spent on recent immigrants with <a href="/wiki/HIV" title="HIV">HIV</a>, an opinion which has been controversial. A <a href="/wiki/YouGov" title="YouGov">YouGov</a> poll found 50% of those taking part to support Farage, with 37% saying that he is scaremongering.</p><p>Farage has said that he supports Muslim immigrants who integrate to British society, but is against those who are &quot;coming here to take us over&quot;, citing <a href="/wiki/John_Howard" title="John Howard">John Howard</a>&apos;s Australia as a government to emulate in that regard. He told a <a href="/wiki/Channel_4" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a> documentary in 2015 that there is a &quot;<a href="/wiki/Fifth_column" title="Fifth column">fifth column</a>&quot; of Islamic extremists in the United Kingdom. Farage has said that the &quot;basic principle&quot; of <a href="/wiki/Enoch_Powell" title="Enoch Powell">Enoch Powell</a>&apos;s &quot;<a href="/wiki/Rivers_of_Blood_speech" title="Rivers of Blood speech">Rivers of Blood speech</a>&quot; was correct.</p><p>In a 2014 interview on the <a href="/wiki/LBC" title="LBC">LBC</a> radio station, Farage said that he would feel &quot;concerned&quot; if a group of <a href="/wiki/Romanian_people" class="mw-redirect" title="Romanian people">Romanian</a> men moved next door to him. When interviewer <a href="/wiki/James_O%27Brien_(radio_presenter)" title="James O&apos;Brien (radio presenter)">James O&apos;Brien</a> inquired what would be the difference between Romanian men moving next door and a group of German children, in reference to Farage&apos;s German wife and children, Farage replied: &quot;You know the difference.&quot; He later expanded on this on the UKIP website, explaining that &quot;if we were able to operate a proper work permit scheme for Romanian nationals, with suitable checks, as recommended by UKIP, then nobody would need to be concerned if a group of Romanian nationals moved in next door to them.&quot;</p><p>Farage called on the British government in 2013 to accept more refugees from the <a href="/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War" title="Syrian Civil War">Syrian Civil War</a>. He later clarified that those refugees should be of the <a href="/wiki/Christianity_in_Syria" title="Christianity in Syria">country&apos;s Christian minority</a>, due to the existence of nearer Muslim-majority safe countries. During the ensuing <a href="/wiki/European_migrant_crisis" title="European migrant crisis">migration crisis</a>, Farage alleged that the majority of people claiming to be refugees were economic migrants, and that some were <a href="/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant" title="Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant">Islamic State</a> militants.</p><p>Farage is critical of Britain&apos;s involvement in the wars in <a href="/wiki/Iraq_War" title="Iraq War">Iraq</a> and <a href="/wiki/Afghanistan_War" class="mw-redirect" title="Afghanistan War">Afghanistan</a>, and cited their financial and human expenses and poor outcomes as reasons for Britain to not become involved militarily in Syria. He has expressed fears that rebel forces in Syria may be Islamic extremists.</p><p>When asked in 2014 which leaders he admired, Farage said &quot;As an operator, but not as a human being, I would say <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Putin" title="Vladimir Putin">Putin</a>. The way he played <a href="/wiki/Russia%27s_role_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War" class="mw-redirect" title="Russia&apos;s role in the Syrian Civil War">the whole Syria thing</a>. Brilliant. Not that I approve of him politically. How many journalists in jail now?&quot;. Farage has criticised what he sees as EU militarism agitating western <a href="/wiki/Ukrainians" title="Ukrainians">Ukrainians</a> against Russia.</p><p>On the subject of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2016" title="United States presidential election, 2016">2016 US presidential election</a>, Farage said in the middle of May that he had reservations on the views and character of <a href="/wiki/Donald_Trump" title="Donald Trump">Donald Trump</a>, but would vote for him to prevent <a href="/wiki/Hillary_Clinton" title="Hillary Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a> becoming president.</p><p>In 2014, Farage said that it is UKIP policy for handguns in the UK to be legalised and licensed, describing the current legislation, brought in after the <a href="/wiki/Dunblane_school_massacre" title="Dunblane school massacre">Dunblane school massacre</a>, as &quot;ludicrous&quot;. He has also said that there was no link between responsible handgun ownership and gun crime.</p><p>Farage has contested several elections under the UKIP banner:</p><p><b>UK Parliament elections</b></p><p><b>European Parliament elections</b></p><p>Farage lives in <a href="/wiki/Single_Street" title="Single Street">Single Street</a>, a hamlet in the <a href="/wiki/London_Borough_of_Bromley" title="London Borough of Bromley">London Borough of Bromley</a>, &quot;around the corner from his mother.&quot; He has been married twice. In 1988 he married Irish nurse Gr&#xE1;inne Hayes, by whom he has two children: Samuel (born 1989) and Thomas (born 1991). The couple divorced in 1997. In 1999 he married Kirsten Mehr, a German national, and they have two children, Victoria (born 2000) and Isabelle (born 2005). He has spoken of how his children have been teased because of their relation to him.</p><p>He has made reference to his German wife in response to criticisms that he is somehow &quot;anti-Europe&quot;, while he himself says he is merely anti-EU. Farage employs his wife as his <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament" title="European Parliament">parliamentary</a> secretary and in April 2014 he explained that &quot;nobody else could do that job.&quot;</p><p>On 25 November 1985, Farage was hit by a car after a night out, and suffered injury to his head and left leg, the latter nearly requiring amputation. He was in casts for 11 months, but recovered, and the nurse who treated him became his first wife. On 26 December 1986, Farage first felt symptoms of what was later discovered to be <a href="/wiki/Testicular_cancer" title="Testicular cancer">testicular cancer</a>. He had the left testicle removed, and the cancer had not spread to any other organs.</p><p>In 2010, Farage published a memoir, entitled <i>Fighting Bull</i> (<i>Flying Free</i> in paperback), outlining the founding of UKIP and his personal and political life so far. A second book, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Purple_Revolution:_The_Year_That_Changed_Everything" title="The Purple Revolution: The Year That Changed Everything">The Purple Revolution: The Year That Changed Everything</a></i>, was released by Biteback Publishing in 2015.</p><p>Farage is also a keen <a href="/wiki/Cricket" title="Cricket">cricket</a> fan and has appeared on <i><a href="/wiki/Test_Match_Special" title="Test Match Special">Test Match Special</a></i>. He appeared in an advertisement for the bookmaker <a href="/wiki/Paddy_Power" title="Paddy Power">Paddy Power</a> ahead of golf&apos;s <a href="/wiki/2014_Ryder_Cup" title="2014 Ryder Cup">2014 Ryder Cup</a>.
