These are often named after famous volcanoes where that type of behavior has been observed. Some volcanoes may exhibit only one characteristic type of eruption during a period of activity, while others may display an entire sequence of types all in one eruptive series.</p><p>There are three different types of eruptions. The most well-observed are <a href="#Magmatic_eruptions">magmatic eruptions</a>, which involve the decompression of gas within magma that propels it forward. <a href="/wiki/Phreatomagmatic_eruption" title="Phreatomagmatic eruption">Phreatomagmatic eruptions</a> are another type of volcanic eruption, driven by the compression of gas within magma, the direct opposite of the process powering magmatic activity. The third eruptive type is the <a href="/wiki/Phreatic_eruption" title="Phreatic eruption">phreatic eruption</a>, which is driven by the <a href="/wiki/Superheating" title="Superheating">superheating</a> of <a href="/wiki/Steam" title="Steam">steam</a> via contact with <a href="/wiki/Magma" title="Magma">magma</a>; these eruptive types often exhibit no magmatic release, instead causing the granulation of existing rock.</p><p>Within these wide-defining eruptive types are several subtypes. The weakest are <a href="/wiki/Hawaiian_eruption" title="Hawaiian eruption">Hawaiian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Submarine_eruption" title="Submarine eruption">submarine</a>, then <a href="/wiki/Strombolian_eruption" title="Strombolian eruption">Strombolian</a>, followed by <a href="/wiki/Vulcanian_eruption" title="Vulcanian eruption">Vulcanian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Surtseyan_eruption" title="Surtseyan eruption">Surtseyan</a>. The stronger eruptive types are <a href="/wiki/Pelean_eruption" class="mw-redirect" title="Pelean eruption">Pelean eruptions</a>, followed by <a href="/wiki/Plinian_eruption" title="Plinian eruption">Plinian eruptions</a>; the strongest eruptions are called &quot;<a href="/wiki/Ultra-Plinian" class="mw-redirect" title="Ultra-Plinian">Ultra-Plinian</a>.&quot; <a href="/wiki/Subglacial_eruption" title="Subglacial eruption">Subglacial</a> and phreatic eruptions are defined by their eruptive mechanism, and vary in strength. An important measure of eruptive strength is <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_Explosivity_Index" class="mw-redirect" title="Volcanic Explosivity Index">Volcanic Explosivity Index</a> (VEI), an <a href="/wiki/Order_of_magnitude" title="Order of magnitude">order of magnitude</a> scale ranging from 0 to 8 that often correlates to eruptive types.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Volcanic eruptions arise through three main mechanisms:</p><p>There are two types of eruptions in terms of activity, <a href="/wiki/Explosive_eruption" title="Explosive eruption">explosive eruptions</a> and <a href="/wiki/Effusive_eruption" title="Effusive eruption">effusive eruptions</a>. Explosive eruptions are characterized by gas-driven explosions that propels <a href="/wiki/Magma" title="Magma">magma</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tephra" title="Tephra">tephra</a>. Effusive eruptions, meanwhile, are characterized by the outpouring of <a href="/wiki/Lava" title="Lava">lava</a> without significant explosive eruption.</p><p>Volcanic eruptions vary widely in strength. On the one extreme there are effusive <a href="/wiki/Hawaiian_eruption" title="Hawaiian eruption">Hawaiian eruptions</a>, which are characterized by <a href="/wiki/Lava_fountain" class="mw-redirect" title="Lava fountain">lava fountains</a> and <a href="/wiki/Viscosity" title="Viscosity">fluid</a> <a href="/wiki/Lava" title="Lava">lava flows</a>, which are typically not very dangerous. On the other extreme, <a href="/wiki/Plinian_eruption" title="Plinian eruption">Plinian eruptions</a> are large, violent, and highly dangerous explosive events. Volcanoes are not bound to one eruptive style, and frequently display many different types, both passive and explosive, even the span of a single eruptive cycle. Volcanoes do not always erupt vertically from a single crater near their peak, either. Some volcanoes exhibit <a href="/wiki/Lateral_eruption" title="Lateral eruption">lateral</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fissure_vent" title="Fissure vent">fissure</a> eruptions. Notably, many <a href="/wiki/Hawaiian_eruption" title="Hawaiian eruption">Hawaiian eruptions</a> start from <a href="/wiki/Rift_zone" title="Rift zone">rift zones</a>, and some of the strongest <a href="/wiki/Surtseyan_eruption" title="Surtseyan eruption">Surtseyan eruptions</a> develop along <a href="/wiki/Fracture_zone" title="Fracture zone">fracture zones</a>. Scientists believed that pulses of magma mixed together in the chamber before climbing upward&#x2014;a process estimated to take several thousands of years. But Columbia University volcanologists found that the eruption of Costa Rica&#x2019;s <a href="/wiki/Iraz%C3%BA_Volcano" title="Iraz&#xFA; Volcano">Iraz&#xFA; Volcano</a> in 1963 was likely triggered by magma that took a nonstop route from the mantle over just a few months.</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_explosivity_index" title="Volcanic explosivity index">volcanic explosivity index</a> (commonly shortened to VEI) is a scale, from 0 to 8, for measuring the strength of eruptions. It is used by the <a href="/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution" title="Smithsonian Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Global_Volcanism_Program" title="Global Volcanism Program">Global Volcanism Program</a> in assessing the impact of historic and prehistoric lava flows. It operates in a way similar to the <a href="/wiki/Richter_scale" class="mw-redirect" title="Richter scale">Richter scale</a> for <a href="/wiki/Earthquake" title="Earthquake">earthquakes</a>, in that each interval in value represents a tenfold increasing in magnitude (it is <a href="/wiki/Logarithm" title="Logarithm">logarithmic</a>).

Hawaiian eruptions are the calmest types of volcanic events, characterized by the <a href="/wiki/Effusive_eruption" title="Effusive eruption">effusive eruption</a> of very <a href="/wiki/Viscosity" title="Viscosity">fluid</a> <a href="/wiki/Basalt" title="Basalt">basalt</a>-type <a href="/wiki/Lava" title="Lava">lavas</a> with low <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_gas" title="Volcanic gas">gaseous content</a>. The volume of ejected material from Hawaiian eruptions is less than half of that found in other eruptive types. Steady production of small amounts of lava builds up the large, broad form of a <a href="/wiki/Shield_volcano" title="Shield volcano">shield volcano</a>. Eruptions are not centralized at the main summit as with other volcanic types, and often occur at vents around the summit and from <a href="/wiki/Fissure_vent" title="Fissure vent">fissure vents</a> radiating out of the center.</p><p>Hawaiian eruptions often begin as a line of vent eruptions along a <a href="/wiki/Fissure_vent" title="Fissure vent">fissure vent</a>, a so-called &quot;curtain of fire.&quot; These die down as the lava begins to concentrate at a few of the vents. Central-vent eruptions, meanwhile, often take the form of large <a href="/wiki/Lava_fountain" class="mw-redirect" title="Lava fountain">lava fountains</a> (both continuous and sporadic), which can reach heights of hundreds of meters or more. The particles from lava fountains usually cool in the air before hitting the ground, resulting in the accumulation of cindery <a href="/wiki/Scoria" title="Scoria">scoria</a> fragments; however, when the air is especially thick with <a href="/wiki/Clast" class="mw-redirect" title="Clast">clasts</a>, they cannot cool off fast enough due to the surrounding heat, and hit the ground still hot, the accumulation of which forms <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_cone#Spatter_cone" title="Volcanic cone">spatter cones</a>. If eruptive rates are high enough, they may even form splatter-fed lava flows. Hawaiian eruptions are often extremely long lived; <a href="/wiki/Pu%CA%BBu_%CA%BB%C5%8C%CA%BB%C5%8D" title="Pu&#x2BB;u &#x2BB;&#x14C;&#x2BB;&#x14D;">Pu&#x2BB;u &#x2BB;&#x14C;&#x2BB;&#x14D;</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Cinder_cone" title="Cinder cone">cinder cone</a> of <a href="/wiki/Kilauea" class="mw-redirect" title="Kilauea">Kilauea</a>, has been erupting continuously since 1983. Another Hawaiian volcanic feature is the formation of active <a href="/wiki/Lava_lake" title="Lava lake">lava lakes</a>, self-maintaining pools of raw lava with a thin crust of semi-cooled rock; there are currently only 5 such lakes in the world, and the one at <a href="/wiki/K%C4%ABlauea" title="K&#x12B;lauea">K&#x12B;lauea</a>&apos;s Kupaianaha vent is one of them.</p><p>Flows from Hawaiian eruptions are basaltic, and can be divided into two types by their structural characteristics. <a href="/wiki/Pahoehoe" class="mw-redirect" title="Pahoehoe">Pahoehoe</a> lava is a relatively smooth lava flow that can be billowy or ropey. They can move as one sheet, by the advancement of &quot;toes,&quot; or as a snaking lava column. <a href="/wiki/A%27a" class="mw-redirect" title="A&apos;a">A&apos;a</a> lava flows are denser and more viscous then pahoehoe, and tend to move slower. Flows can measure 2 to 20&#xA0;m (7 to 66&#xA0;ft) thick. A&apos;a flows are so thick that the outside layers cools into a rubble-like mass, insulating the still-hot interior and preventing it from cooling. A&apos;a lava moves in a peculiar way&#x2014;the front of the flow steepens due to pressure from behind until it breaks off, after which the general mass behind it moves forward. Pahoehoe lava can sometimes become A&apos;a lava due to increasing <a href="/wiki/Viscosity" title="Viscosity">viscosity</a> or increasing rate of <a href="/wiki/Shear_(geology)" title="Shear (geology)">shear</a>, but A&apos;a lava never turns into pahoehoe flow.</p><p>Hawaiian eruptions are responsible for several unique volcanological objects. Small volcanic particles are carried and formed by the wind, chilling quickly into teardrop-shaped <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_glass" title="Volcanic glass">glassy</a> fragments known as <a href="/wiki/Pele%27s_tears" title="Pele&apos;s tears">Pele&apos;s tears</a> (after <a href="/wiki/Pele_(deity)" title="Pele (deity)">Pele</a>, the Hawaiian volcano deity). During especially high winds these chunks may even take the form of long drawn-out strands, known as <a href="/wiki/Pele%27s_hair" title="Pele&apos;s hair">Pele&apos;s hair</a>. Sometimes basalt aerates into <a href="/wiki/Reticulite" class="mw-redirect" title="Reticulite">reticulite</a>, the lowest density rock type on earth.</p><p>Although Hawaiian eruptions are named after the volcanoes of Hawaii, they are not necessarily restricted to them; the largest lava fountain ever recorded formed on the island of <a href="/wiki/Izu_%C5%8Cshima" title="Izu &#x14C;shima">Izu &#x14C;shima</a> (on <a href="/wiki/Mount_Mihara" title="Mount Mihara">Mount Mihara</a>) in 1986, a 1,600&#xA0;m (5,249&#xA0;ft) gusher that was more than twice as high as the mountain itself (which stands at 764&#xA0;m (2,507&#xA0;ft)).</p><p>Volcanoes known to have Hawaiian activity include:</p><p>Strombolian eruptions are a type of volcanic eruption, named after the volcano <a href="/wiki/Stromboli" title="Stromboli">Stromboli</a>, which has been erupting continuously for centuries. Strombolian eruptions are driven by the bursting of gas bubbles within the <a href="/wiki/Magma" title="Magma">magma</a>. These gas bubbles within the magma accumulate and coalesce into large bubbles, called <a href="/wiki/Gas_slug" title="Gas slug">gas slugs</a>. These grow large enough to rise through the lava column. Upon reaching the surface, the difference in <a href="/wiki/Air_pressure" class="mw-redirect" title="Air pressure">air pressure</a> causes the bubble to burst with a loud pop, throwing magma in the air in a way similar to a <a href="/wiki/Soap_bubble" title="Soap bubble">soap bubble</a>. Because of the high <a href="/wiki/Partial_pressure" title="Partial pressure">gas pressures</a> associated with the lavas, continued activity is generally in the form of episodic <a href="/wiki/Explosive_eruption" title="Explosive eruption">explosive eruptions</a> accompanied by the distinctive loud blasts. During eruptions, these blasts occur as often as every few minutes.</p><p>The term &quot;Strombolian&quot; has been used indiscriminately to describe a wide variety of volcanic eruptions, varying from small volcanic blasts to large <a href="/wiki/Eruption_column" title="Eruption column">eruptive columns</a>. In reality, true Strombolian eruptions are characterized by short-lived and explosive eruptions of lavas with intermediate <a href="/wiki/Viscosity" title="Viscosity">viscosity</a>, often ejected high into the air. Columns can measure hundreds of meters in height. The lavas formed by Strombolian eruptions are a form of relatively viscous <a href="/wiki/Basalt" title="Basalt">basaltic</a> lava, and its end product is mostly <a href="/wiki/Scoria" title="Scoria">scoria</a>. The relative passivity of Strombolian eruptions, and its non-damaging nature to its source vent allow Strombolian eruptions to continue unabated for thousands of years, and also makes it one of the least dangerous eruptive types.</p><p>Strombolian eruptions eject <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_bomb" title="Volcanic bomb">volcanic bombs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lapilli" title="Lapilli">lapilli</a> fragments that travel in parabolic paths before landing around their source vent. The steady accumulation of small fragments builds <a href="/wiki/Cinder_cone" title="Cinder cone">cinder cones</a> composed completely of basaltic <a href="/wiki/Pyroclast" class="mw-redirect" title="Pyroclast">pyroclasts</a>. This form of accumulation tends to result in well-ordered rings of <a href="/wiki/Tephra" title="Tephra">tephra</a>.</p><p>Strombolian eruptions are similar to <a href="/wiki/Hawaiian_eruption" title="Hawaiian eruption">Hawaiian eruptions</a>, but there are differences. Strombolian eruptions are noisier, produce no sustained <a href="/wiki/Eruption_column" title="Eruption column">eruptive columns</a>, do not produce some volcanic products associated with Hawaiian volcanism (specifically <a href="/wiki/Pele%27s_tears" title="Pele&apos;s tears">Pele&apos;s tears</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pele%27s_hair" title="Pele&apos;s hair">Pele&apos;s hair</a>), and produce fewer molten lava flows (although the eruptive material does tend to form small rivulets).</p><p>Volcanoes known to have Strombolian activity include:</p><p>Vulcanian eruptions are a type of volcanic eruption, named after the volcano <a href="/wiki/Vulcano" title="Vulcano">Vulcano</a>. It was named so following <a href="/wiki/Giuseppe_Mercalli" title="Giuseppe Mercalli">Giuseppe Mercalli</a>&apos;s observations of its 1888-1890 eruptions. In Vulcanian eruptions, highly <a href="/wiki/Viscosity" title="Viscosity">viscous</a> magma within the volcano make it difficult for <a href="/wiki/Vesicular_texture" title="Vesicular texture">vesiculate gases</a> to escape. Similar to Strombolian eruptions, this leads to the buildup of high <a href="/wiki/Gas_pressure" class="mw-redirect" title="Gas pressure">gas pressure</a>, eventually popping the cap holding the magma down and resulting in an explosive eruption. However, unlike Strombolian eruptions, ejected lava fragments are not aerodynamic; this is due to the higher viscosity of Vulcanian magma and the greater incorporation of <a href="/wiki/Crystalline" class="mw-redirect" title="Crystalline">crystalline</a> material broken off from the former cap. They are also more explosive than their Strombolian counterparts, with <a href="/wiki/Eruption_column" title="Eruption column">eruptive columns</a> often reaching between 5 and 10&#xA0;km (3 and 6&#xA0;mi) high. Lastly, Vulcanian deposits are <a href="/wiki/Andesitic" class="mw-redirect" title="Andesitic">andesitic</a> to <a href="/wiki/Dacitic" class="mw-redirect" title="Dacitic">dacitic</a> rather than <a href="/wiki/Basalt" title="Basalt">basaltic</a>.</p><p>Initial Vulcanian activity is characterized by a series of short-lived explosions, lasting a few minutes to a few hours and typified by the ejection of <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_bomb" title="Volcanic bomb">volcanic bombs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_block" title="Volcanic block">blocks</a>. These eruptions wear down the <a href="/wiki/Lava_dome" title="Lava dome">lava dome</a> holding the magma down, and it disintegrates, leading to much more quiet and continuous eruptions. Thus an early sign of future Vulcanian activity is lava dome growth, and its collapse generates an outpouring of <a href="/wiki/Pyroclast" class="mw-redirect" title="Pyroclast">pyroclastic</a> material down the volcano&apos;s slope.</p><p>Deposits near the source vent consist of large <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_block" title="Volcanic block">volcanic blocks</a> and <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_bomb" title="Volcanic bomb">bombs</a>, with so-called &quot;<a href="/wiki/Volcanic_bomb#Types_of_bombs" title="Volcanic bomb">bread-crust bombs</a>&quot; being especially common. These deeply cracked volcanic chunks form when the exterior of ejected lava cools quickly into a <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_glass" title="Volcanic glass">glassy</a> or <a href="/wiki/Particle_size_(grain_size)" class="mw-redirect" title="Particle size (grain size)">fine-grained</a> shell, but the inside continues to cool and <a href="/wiki/Vesicular_texture" title="Vesicular texture">vesiculate</a>. The center of the fragment expands, cracking the exterior. However the bulk of Vulcanian deposits are fine grained <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_ash" title="Volcanic ash">ash</a>. The ash is only moderately dispersed, and its abundance indicates a high degree of <a href="/wiki/Debris#Geological" title="Debris">fragmentation</a>, the result of high gas contents within the magma. In some cases these have been found to be the result of interaction with <a href="/wiki/Meteoric_water" title="Meteoric water">meteoric water</a>, suggesting that Vulcanian eruptions are partially <a href="/wiki/Phreatomagmatic_eruption" title="Phreatomagmatic eruption">hydrovolcanic</a>.</p><p>Volcanoes that have exhibited Vulcanian activity include:</p><p>Pel&#xE9;an eruptions (or <a href="/wiki/Pyroclastic_flow" title="Pyroclastic flow">nu&#xE9;e ardente</a>) are a type of volcanic eruption, named after the volcano <a href="/wiki/Mount_Pel%C3%A9e" title="Mount Pel&#xE9;e">Mount Pel&#xE9;e</a> in <a href="/wiki/Martinique" title="Martinique">Martinique</a>, the site of a massive Pel&#xE9;an eruption in 1902 that is one of the worst natural disasters in history. In Pel&#xE9;an eruptions, a large amount of gas, dust, ash, and lava fragments are blown out the volcano&apos;s central crater, driven by the collapse of <a href="/wiki/Rhyolite" title="Rhyolite">rhyolite</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dacite" title="Dacite">dacite</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Andesite" title="Andesite">andesite</a> <a href="/wiki/Lava_dome" title="Lava dome">lava dome</a> collapses that often create large <a href="/wiki/Eruption_column" title="Eruption column">eruptive columns</a>. An early sign of a coming eruption is the growth of a so-called Pel&#xE9;an or <a href="/wiki/Lava_spine" title="Lava spine">lava spine</a>, a bulge in the volcano&apos;s summit preempting its total collapse. The material collapses upon itself, forming a fast-moving <a href="/wiki/Pyroclastic_flow" title="Pyroclastic flow">pyroclastic flow</a> (known as a <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_block" title="Volcanic block">block</a>-and-<a href="/wiki/Volcanic_ash" title="Volcanic ash">ash</a> flow) that moves down the side of the mountain at tremendous speeds, often over 150&#xA0;km (93&#xA0;mi) per hour. These massive <a href="/wiki/Landslide" title="Landslide">landslides</a> make Pel&#xE9;an eruptions one of the most dangerous in the world, capable of tearing through populated areas and causing massive loss of life. The <a href="/wiki/Mount_Pel%C3%A9e#1902_eruption" title="Mount Pel&#xE9;e">1902 eruption of Mount Pel&#xE9;e</a> caused tremendous destruction, killing more than 30,000 people and competely destroying the town of <a href="/wiki/Saint-Pierre,_Martinique" title="Saint-Pierre, Martinique">St. Pierre</a>, the <a href="/wiki/List_of_natural_disasters_by_death_toll#Volcanic_eruptions" title="List of natural disasters by death toll">worst volcanic event in the 20th century</a>.</p><p>Pel&#xE9;an eruptions are characterized most prominently by the <a href="/wiki/Incandescence" title="Incandescence">incandescent</a> pyroclastic flows that they drive.

These bubbles agglutinate and once they reach a certain size (about 75% of the total volume of the magma conduit) they explode. The narrow confines of the conduit force the gases and associated magma up, forming an <a href="/wiki/Eruption_column" title="Eruption column">eruptive column</a>. Eruption velocity is controlled by the gas contents of the column, and low-strength surface rocks commonly crack under the pressure of the eruption, forming a flared outgoing structure that pushes the gases even faster.</p><p>These massive eruptive columns are the distinctive feature of a Plinian eruption, and reach up 2 to 45&#xA0;km (1 to 28&#xA0;mi) into the <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere" title="Atmosphere">atmosphere</a>.

They are also similar to Hawaiian <a href="/wiki/Lava_fountain" class="mw-redirect" title="Lava fountain">lava fountains</a> in that both eruptive types produce sustained eruption columns maintained by the growth of bubbles that move up at about the same speed as the magma surrounding them.</p><p>Regions affected by Plinian eruptions are subjected to heavy <a href="/wiki/Pumice" title="Pumice">pumice</a> airfall affecting an area 0.5 to 50&#xA0;km (0 to 12&#xA0;cu&#xA0;mi) in size.

The products of phreatomagmatic eruptions are believed to be more regular in shape and <a href="/wiki/Granularity" title="Granularity">finer</a> <a href="/wiki/Particle_size_(grain_size)" class="mw-redirect" title="Particle size (grain size)">grained</a> than the products of magmatic eruptions because of the differences in eruptive mechanisms.</p><p>There is debate about the exact nature of phreatomagmatic eruptions, and some scientists believe that <a href="/wiki/Fuel-coolant_interaction" class="mw-redirect" title="Fuel-coolant interaction">fuel-coolant reactions</a> may be more critical to the explosive nature than thermal contraction. Fuel coolant reactions may fragment the volcanic material by propagating <a href="/wiki/Compressive_stress" title="Compressive stress">stress waves</a>, widening cracks and increasing <a href="/wiki/Surface_area" title="Surface area">surface area</a> that ultimetly lead to rapid cooling and explosive contraction-driven eruptions.</p><p>A Surtseyan eruption (or hydrovolcanic) is a type of volcanic eruption caused by shallow-water interactions between water and lava, named so after its most famous example, the eruption and formation of the island of <a href="/wiki/Surtsey" title="Surtsey">Surtsey</a> off the coast of <a href="/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> in 1963. Surtseyan eruptions are the &quot;wet&quot; equivalent of ground-based <a href="/wiki/Strombolian_eruption" title="Strombolian eruption">Strombolian eruptions</a>, but because of where they are taking place they are much more explosive. This is because as water is heated by lava, it <a href="/wiki/Superheated_water" title="Superheated water">flashes</a> in <a href="/wiki/Steam" title="Steam">steam</a> and expands violently, fragmenting the magma it is in contact with into fine-grained <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_ash" title="Volcanic ash">ash</a>. Surtseyan eruptions are the hallmark of shallow-water <a href="/wiki/Seamount" title="Seamount">volcanic</a> <a href="/wiki/Oceanic_island" class="mw-redirect" title="Oceanic island">oceanic islands</a>, however they are not specifically confined to them. Surtseyan eruptions can happen on land as well, and are caused by <a href="/wiki/Magma_conduit" class="mw-redirect" title="Magma conduit">rising</a> <a href="/wiki/Magma" title="Magma">magma</a> that comes into contact with an <a href="/wiki/Aquifer" title="Aquifer">aquifer</a> (water-bearing rock formation) at shallow levels under the volcano. The products of Surtseyan eruptions are generally <a href="/wiki/Oxidized" class="mw-redirect" title="Oxidized">oxidized</a> <a href="/wiki/Palagonite" title="Palagonite">palagonite</a> <a href="/wiki/Basalt" title="Basalt">basalts</a> (though <a href="/wiki/Andesitic" class="mw-redirect" title="Andesitic">andesitic</a> eruptions do occur, albeit rarely), and like Strombolian eruptions Surtseyan eruptions are generally continuous or otherwise rhythmic.</p><p>A distinct defining feature of a Surtseyan eruption is the formation of a <a href="/wiki/Pyroclastic_surge" title="Pyroclastic surge">pyroclastic surge</a> (or <i>base surge</i>), a ground hugging radial cloud that develops along with the <a href="/wiki/Eruption_column" title="Eruption column">eruption column</a>. Base surges are caused by the gravitational collapse of a <a href="/wiki/Water_vapor" title="Water vapor">vaporous</a> eruptive column, one that is denser overall then a regular volcanic column. The densest part of the cloud is nearest to the vent, resulting a wedge shape. Associated with these laterally moving rings are <a href="/wiki/Sand_dune" class="mw-redirect" title="Sand dune">dune</a>-shaped depositions of rock left behind by the lateral movement. These are occasionally disrupted by <a href="/wiki/Bomb_sag" class="mw-redirect" title="Bomb sag">bomb sags</a>, rock that was flung out by the explosive eruption and followed a <a href="/wiki/Ballistics" title="Ballistics">ballistic</a> path to the ground. Accumulations of wet, spherical ash known as <a href="/wiki/Accretionary_lapilli" class="mw-redirect" title="Accretionary lapilli">accretionary lapilli</a> is another common surge indicator.</p><p>Over time Surtseyan eruptions tend to form <a href="/wiki/Maar" title="Maar">maars</a>, broad low-<a href="/wiki/Relief" title="Relief">relief</a> <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_crater" title="Volcanic crater">volcanic craters</a> dug into the ground, and <a href="/wiki/Tuff_ring" class="mw-redirect" title="Tuff ring">tuff rings</a>, circular structures built of rapidly quenched lava. These structures are associated with a single vent eruption, however if eruptions arise along <a href="/wiki/Fracture_zone" title="Fracture zone">fracture zones</a> a <a href="/wiki/Rift_zone" title="Rift zone">rift zone</a> may be dug out; these eruptions tend to be more violent then the ones forming a tuff ring or maars, an example being the <a href="/wiki/Mount_Tarawera#The_1886_eruption" title="Mount Tarawera">1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera</a>. Littoral cones are another hydrovolcanic feature, generated by the explosive deposition of basaltic tephra (although they are not truly volcanic vents). They form when lava accumulates within cracks in lava, superheats and explodes in a <a href="/wiki/Steam_explosion" title="Steam explosion">steam explosion</a>, breaking the rock apart and depositing it on the volcano&apos;s flank. Consecutive explosions of this type eventually generate the cone.</p><p>Volcanoes known to have Surtseyan activity include:</p><p>Submarine eruptions are a type of volcanic eruption that occurs underwater. An estimated 75% of the total volcanic eruptive volume is generated by submarine eruptions near <a href="/wiki/Mid_ocean_ridge" class="mw-redirect" title="Mid ocean ridge">mid ocean ridges</a> alone, however because of the problems associated with detecting <a href="/wiki/Deep_sea" title="Deep sea">deep sea</a> volcanics, they remained virtually unknown until advances in the 1990s made it possible to observe them.</p><p>Submarine eruptions may produce <a href="/wiki/Seamount" title="Seamount">seamounts</a> which may break the surface to form volcanic islands and island chains.</p><p>Submarine volcanism is driven by various processes. Volcanoes near <a href="/wiki/Divergent_boundary" title="Divergent boundary">plate boundaries</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mid-ocean_ridge" title="Mid-ocean ridge">mid-ocean ridges</a> are built by the <a href="/wiki/Igneous_rock#Decompression" title="Igneous rock">decompression melting</a> of mantle rock that rises on an upwelling portion of a convection cell to the crustal surface. Eruptions associated with <a href="/wiki/Subduction" title="Subduction">subducting zones</a>, meanwhile, are driven by subducting <a href="/wiki/Plate_tectonics" title="Plate tectonics">plates</a> that add <a href="/wiki/Volatiles" title="Volatiles">volatiles</a> to the rising plate, lowering its <a href="/wiki/Melting_point" title="Melting point">melting point</a>. Each process generates different rock; mid-ocean ridge volcanics are primarily <a href="/wiki/Basalt" title="Basalt">basaltic</a>, whereas subduction flows are mostly <a href="/wiki/Calc-alkaline" class="mw-redirect" title="Calc-alkaline">calc-alkaline</a>, and more explosive and <a href="/wiki/Viscous" class="mw-redirect" title="Viscous">viscous</a>.</p><p>Spreading rates along mid-ocean ridges vary widely, from 2&#xA0;cm (0.8&#xA0;in) per year at the <a href="/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_Ridge" title="Mid-Atlantic Ridge">Mid-Atlantic Ridge</a>, to up to 16&#xA0;cm (6&#xA0;in) along the <a href="/wiki/East_Pacific_Rise" title="East Pacific Rise">East Pacific Rise</a>. Higher spreading rates are a probably cause for higher levels of volcanism. The technology for studying seamount eruptions did not exist until advancements in <a href="/wiki/Hydrophone" title="Hydrophone">hydrophone</a> technology made it possible to &quot;listen&quot; to <a href="/wiki/Acoustic_wave" title="Acoustic wave">acoustic waves</a>, known as T-waves, released by <a href="/wiki/Submarine_earthquake" title="Submarine earthquake">submarine earthquakes</a> associated with submarine volcanic eruptions. The reason for this is that land-based <a href="/wiki/Seismometer" title="Seismometer">seismometers</a> cannot detect sea-based earthquakes below a <a href="/wiki/Richter_scale" class="mw-redirect" title="Richter scale">magnitude</a> of 4, but acoustic waves travel well in water and long periods of time. A system in the <a href="/wiki/North_Pacific" class="mw-redirect" title="North Pacific">North Pacific</a>, maintained by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy" title="United States Navy">United States Navy</a> and originally intended for the detection of <a href="/wiki/Submarine" title="Submarine">submarines</a>, has detected an event on average every 2 to 3 years.</p><p>The most common underwater flow is <a href="/wiki/Pillow_lava" title="Pillow lava">pillow lava</a>, a circular lava flow named after its unusual shape. Less common are <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_glass" title="Volcanic glass">glassy</a>, marginal sheet flows, indicative of larger-scale flows. <a href="/wiki/Pyroclastic_rock" title="Pyroclastic rock">Volcaniclastic</a> <a href="/wiki/Sedimentary_rock" title="Sedimentary rock">sedimentary rocks</a> are common in shallow-water environments. As plate movement starts to carry the volcanoes away from their eruptive source, eruption rates start to die down, and <a href="/wiki/Erosion#Water" title="Erosion">water erosion</a> grinds the volcano down. The final stages of eruption caps the seamount in <a href="/wiki/Alkalic" class="mw-redirect" title="Alkalic">alkalic</a> flows. There are about 100,000 deepwater volcanoes in the world, although most are beyond the active stage of their life. Some exemplary seamounts are <a href="/wiki/Loihi_Seamount" class="mw-redirect" title="Loihi Seamount">Loihi Seamount</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bowie_Seamount" title="Bowie Seamount">Bowie Seamount</a>, <a href="/wiki/Davidson_Seamount" title="Davidson Seamount">Davidson Seamount</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Axial_Seamount" title="Axial Seamount">Axial Seamount</a>.</p><p>Subglacial eruptions are a type of volcanic eruption characterized by interactions between lava and <a href="/wiki/Ice" title="Ice">ice</a>, often under a <a href="/wiki/Glacier" title="Glacier">glacier</a>. The nature of glaciovolcanism dictates that it occurs at areas of high <a href="/wiki/Latitude" title="Latitude">latitude</a> and high <a href="/wiki/Altitude" title="Altitude">altitude</a>. It has been suggested that subglacial volcanoes that are not actively erupting often dump <a href="/wiki/Heat" title="Heat">heat</a> into the ice covering them, producing <a href="/wiki/Meltwater" title="Meltwater">meltwater</a>. This meltwater mix means that subglacial eruptions often generate dangerous <a href="/wiki/J%C3%B6kulhlaup" title="J&#xF6;kulhlaup">j&#xF6;kulhlaups</a> (<a href="/wiki/Flood" title="Flood">floods</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Lahar" title="Lahar">lahars</a>.</p><p>The study of glaciovolcanism is still a relatively new field. Early accounts described the unusual flat-topped steep-sided volcanoes (called <a href="/wiki/Tuya" title="Tuya">tuyas</a>) in <a href="/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> that were suggested to have formed from eruptions below ice. The first English-language paper on the subject was published in 1947 by <a href="/wiki/William_Henry_Mathews" class="mw-redirect" title="William Henry Mathews">William Henry Mathews</a>, describing the <a href="/wiki/Tuya_Butte" title="Tuya Butte">Tuya Butte</a> field in northwest <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>. The eruptive process that builds these structures, originally inferred in the paper, begins with volcanic growth below the glacier. At first the eruptions resemble those that occur in the deep sea, forming piles of <a href="/wiki/Pillow_lava" title="Pillow lava">pillow lava</a> at the base of the volcanic structure. Some of the lava shatters when it comes in contact with the cold ice, forming a <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_glass" title="Volcanic glass">glassy</a> <a href="/wiki/Breccia" title="Breccia">breccia</a> called <a href="/wiki/Hyaloclastite" title="Hyaloclastite">hyaloclastite</a>. After a while the ice finally melts into a lake, and the more explosive eruptions of <a href="/wiki/Surtseyan_eruption" title="Surtseyan eruption">Surtseyan activity</a> begins, building up flanks made up of mostly hyaloclastite. Eventually the lake boils off from continued volcanism, and the lava flows become more <a href="/wiki/Effusive_eruption" title="Effusive eruption">effusive</a> and thicken as the lava cools much more slowly, often forming <a href="/wiki/Columnar_jointing" title="Columnar jointing">columnar jointing</a>. Well-preserved tuyas show all of these stages, for example <a href="/w/index.php?title=Hjorleifshofdi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Hjorleifshofdi (page does not exist)">Hjorleifshofdi</a> in Iceland.</p><p>Products of volcano-ice interactions stand as various structures, whose shape is dependent on complex eruptive and environmental interactions. Glacial volcanism is a good indicator of past ice distribution, making it an important climatic marker. Since they are imbedded in ice, as ice retracts worldwide there are concerns that <a href="/wiki/Tuya" title="Tuya">tuyas</a> and other structures may destabalize, resulting in mass <a href="/wiki/Landslide" title="Landslide">landslides</a>. Evidence of volcanic-glacial interactions are evident in <a href="/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> and parts of <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a>, and it is even possible that they play a role in <a href="/wiki/Ice_age" title="Ice age">deglaciation</a>.</p><p>Glaciovolcanic products have been identified in Iceland, the Canadian province of British Columbia, the U.S. states of <a href="/wiki/Hawaii" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> and <a href="/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Cascade_Range" title="Cascade Range">Cascade Range</a> of western North America, <a href="/wiki/South_America" title="South America">South America</a> and even on the planet <a href="/wiki/Mars" title="Mars">Mars</a>. Volcanoes known to have subglacial activity include:</p><p>Viable microbial communities have been found living in deep (-2800 m) geothermal groundwater at 349 K and pressures &gt;300 bar. Furthermore, microbes have been postulated to exist in basaltic rocks in rinds of altered volcanic glass. All of these conditions could exist in polar regions of Mars today where subglacial volcanism has occurred.</p><p>Phreatic eruptions (or steam-blast eruptions) are a type of eruption driven by the expansion of <a href="/wiki/Steam" title="Steam">steam</a>. When cold ground or surface water come into contact with hot rock or magma it <a href="/wiki/Superheat" title="Superheat">superheats</a> and <a href="/wiki/Steam_explosion" title="Steam explosion">explodes</a>, fracturing the surrounding rock and thrusting out a mixture of steam, <a href="/wiki/Water" title="Water">water</a>, <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_ash" title="Volcanic ash">ash</a>, <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_bomb" title="Volcanic bomb">volcanic bombs</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_block" title="Volcanic block">volcanic blocks</a>. The distinguishing feature of phreatic explosions is that they only blast out fragments of pre-existing solid rock from the volcanic conduit; no new magma is erupted. Because they are driven by the cracking of rock strata under pressure, phreatic activity does not always result in an eruption; if the rock face is strong enough to withstand the explosive force, outright eruptions may not occur, although cracks in the rock will probably develop and weaken it, furthering future eruptions.</p><p>Often a precursor of future volcanic activity, phreatic eruptions are generally weak, although there have been exceptions. Some phreatic events may be triggered by <a href="/wiki/Earthquake" title="Earthquake">earthquake</a> activity, another volcanic precursor, and they may also travel along <a href="/wiki/Dike_(geology)" title="Dike (geology)">dike</a> lines. Phreatic eruptions form <a href="/wiki/Base_surge" class="mw-redirect" title="Base surge">base surges</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lahar" title="Lahar">lahars</a>, <a href="/wiki/Avalanche" title="Avalanche">avalanches</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Volcanic_block" title="Volcanic block">volcanic block</a> &quot;rain.&quot; They may also release deadly <a href="/wiki/Toxic_gas" class="mw-redirect" title="Toxic gas">toxic gas</a> able to suffocate anyone in range of the eruption.</p><p>Volcanoes known to exhibit phreatic activity include:</p>
