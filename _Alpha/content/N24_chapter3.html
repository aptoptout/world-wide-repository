The organization had evolved from an economic union into a political union. The name change reflected this.</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Referendum_Party" title="Referendum Party">Referendum Party</a> was formed in 1994 by <a href="/wiki/Sir_James_Goldsmith" class="mw-redirect" title="Sir James Goldsmith">Sir James Goldsmith</a> to contest the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1997" title="United Kingdom general election, 1997">1997 general election</a> on a platform of providing a referendum on the UK&apos;s membership of the EU.

Soon afterwards the <a href="/wiki/European_Union_Referendum_Act_2015" title="European Union Referendum Act 2015">European Union Referendum Act 2015</a> was introduced into Parliament to enable the referendum. Despite being in favour of remaining in a reformed European Union himself, Cameron announced that Conservative Ministers and MPs were free to campaign in favour of remaining in the EU or leaving it, according to their conscience. This decision came after mounting pressure for a <a href="/wiki/Free_vote" class="mw-redirect" title="Free vote">free vote</a> for ministers. In an exception to the usual rule of <a href="/wiki/Cabinet_collective_responsibility" title="Cabinet collective responsibility">cabinet collective responsibility</a>, Cameron allowed cabinet ministers to publicly campaign for EU withdrawal.</p><p>In a speech to the House of Commons on 22 February 2016, Cameron announced a referendum date of 23 June 2016 and set out the legal framework for withdrawal from the European Union in circumstances where there was a referendum majority vote to leave, citing Article 50 of the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Lisbon" title="Treaty of Lisbon">Lisbon Treaty</a>. Cameron spoke of an intention to trigger the Article 50 process immediately following a leave vote and of the &quot;two-year time period to negotiate the arrangements for exit.&quot;</p><p>The official campaign group for leaving the EU was <a href="/wiki/Vote_Leave" title="Vote Leave">Vote Leave</a>.

An October 2015 analysis of polling suggested that younger voters tend to support remaining in the EU, whereas older voters tend to support leaving, but there is no gender split in attitudes.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Article_50" class="mw-redirect" title="Article 50">Article 50</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_on_European_Union" title="Treaty on European Union">Treaty on European Union</a> provides that: &quot;Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements.&quot; Article 50 was inserted by the <a href="/wiki/Lisbon_Treaty" class="mw-redirect" title="Lisbon Treaty">Lisbon Treaty</a> in 2007, before which the treaties were silent on the possibility of <a href="/wiki/Withdrawal_from_the_European_Union" title="Withdrawal from the European Union">withdrawal from the European Union</a>. Once a member state has notified the <a href="/wiki/European_Council" title="European Council">European Council</a> of its intent to leave the EU, a period begins during which a leaving agreement is negotiated setting out the arrangements for the withdrawal and outlining the country&apos;s future relationship with the Union. For the agreement to enter into force it needs to be approved by at least 72 percent of the continuing member states representing at least 65 percent of their population, and the consent of the European Parliament. The treaties cease to apply to the member state concerned on the entry into force of the leaving agreement, or in the absence of such an agreement, two years after the member state notified the European Council of its intent to leave, although this period can be extended by unanimous agreement of the European Council. <a href="/wiki/Article_50" class="mw-redirect" title="Article 50">Article 50</a> termination notice starts a two year period, known as a Sunset Period, when the details of a Withdrawal Agreement are negotiated. If the Sunset Period is not extended beyond the two year period or ratified by unanimous agreement of all Member EU States and if no Withdrawal Agreement is entered into within such two year period, then the UK will automatically cease to be a Member State of the EU after two years. Instead of going through the internal EU process, the UK could also unilaterally withdraw by repealing the enabling <a href="/wiki/European_Communities_Act_1972_(UK)" title="European Communities Act 1972 (UK)">European Communities Act 1972 (UK)</a>.</p><p>As was the case with the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_independence_referendum,_2014" title="Scottish independence referendum, 2014">Scottish independence referendum</a> two years earlier, the 2016 referendum did not directly require the government to do anything in particular. It does not require the government to initiate, or even schedule, the Article 50 procedure, although David Cameron stated during the campaign that he would invoke Article 50 straight away in the event of a leave victory.</p><p>There is no established, formal process for holding a second referendum to &quot;confirm&quot; the decision to leave following negotiations. Alan Renwick of the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_Unit" title="Constitution Unit">Constitution Unit</a> of University College London argues that Article 50 negotiations cannot be used to renegotiate the conditions of future membership and that Article 50 does not provide the legal basis of withdrawing a decision to leave. The UK government has stated that they would expect a leave vote to be followed by withdrawal, not by a second vote.</p><p>Following the referendum result, Cameron announced that he would resign before the Conservative party conference in October, and that it would be for the incoming Prime Minister to invoke Article 50 of the EU Treaty.</p><p>Now that the UK electorate has voted to leave the EU, its subsequent relationship with the remaining EU members could take several forms. A research paper presented to the UK Parliament proposed a number of alternatives to membership which would continue to allow access with the EU <a href="/wiki/Internal_market" title="Internal market">internal market</a>. These include remaining in the <a href="/wiki/European_Economic_Area" title="European Economic Area">European Economic Area</a> (EEA) as a <a href="/wiki/European_Free_Trade_Association" title="European Free Trade Association">European Free Trade Association</a> (EFTA) member, or seeking to negotiate bilateral terms along the <a href="/wiki/Switzerland%E2%80%93European_Union_relations" title="Switzerland&#x2013;European Union relations">Swiss model</a> with a series of interdependent sectoral agreements.</p><p>Were the UK to join the EEA as an EFTA member, it would have to sign up to EU internal market legislation without being able to participate in its development or vote on its content. However, the EU is required to conduct extensive consultations with non-EU members beforehand via its many committees and cooperative bodies. Some EU law originates from various international bodies on which non-EU EEA countries have a seat.</p><p>The EEA Agreement (EU and EFTA members except Switzerland) does not cover <a href="/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy" title="Common Agricultural Policy">Common Agriculture and Fisheries Policies</a>, <a href="/wiki/European_Union_Customs_Union" title="European Union Customs Union">Customs Union</a>, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Common_Commercial_Policy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Common Commercial Policy (page does not exist)">Common Trade Policy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Common_Foreign_and_Security_Policy" title="Common Foreign and Security Policy">Common Foreign and Security Policy</a>, direct and indirect taxation, and <a href="/wiki/Police_and_Judicial_Co-operation_in_Criminal_Matters" title="Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters">Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters</a>, leaving EFTA members free to set their own policies in these areas; however, EFTA countries are required to contribute to the <a href="/wiki/EU_Budget" class="mw-redirect" title="EU Budget">EU Budget</a> in exchange for access to the internal market.</p><p>The EEA Agreement and the agreement with Switzerland cover free movement of goods, and <a href="/wiki/Free_Movement_Directive" class="mw-redirect" title="Free Movement Directive">free movement of people</a>. Many supporters of Brexit want to restrict freedom of movement, however an EEA Agreement would include free movement for EU and EEA citizens, as passport systems allow EEA institutions to access markets in EU Member States, for the most part, without having to establish subsidiaries in each EU Member State and incur the costs of full authorisation in those jurisdiction. Others present ideas of a <a href="/wiki/Switzerland%E2%80%93European_Union_relations" title="Switzerland&#x2013;European Union relations">Swiss solution</a>, that is tailor-made agreements between the UK and the EU, but EU representatives have claimed they would not support such a solution.

On the one hand, a withdrawal could tip the EU towards protectionism, exacerbate existing divisions, or unleash centrifugal forces leading to the EU&apos;s unravelling. Alternatively, the EU could free itself of its most awkward member, making the EU easier to lead and more effective.&quot;</p><p>The Conservative <a href="/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament" title="Member of the European Parliament">MEP</a> representing South East England, <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Hannan" title="Daniel Hannan">Daniel Hannan</a>, predicted on BBC <i><a href="/wiki/Newsnight" title="Newsnight">Newsnight</a></i> that the level of immigration would remain high after Brexit: &quot;Frankly, if people watching think that they have voted and there is now going to be zero immigration from the EU, they are going to be disappointed. ... you will look in vain for anything that the Leave campaign said at any point that ever suggested there would ever be any kind of border closure or drawing up of the drawbridge.&quot;</p><p>The UK treasury have estimated that being in the EU has a strong positive effect on trade and as a result the UK&apos;s trade would be worse off if it left the EU.</p><p>Supporters of withdrawal from the EU have argued that by ceasing to make a net contribution to the EU would allow for some cuts to taxes and/or increases in government spending. However, Britain would still be required to make contributions to the EU budget if it opted to remain in the European Free Trade Area. The Institute for Fiscal Studies notes that most majority of forecasts of the impact of Brexit on the UK economy would leave the government with less money to spend even if it no longer had to pay into the EU.</p><p>Former <a href="/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer" title="Chancellor of the Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> <a href="/wiki/Norman_Lamont" title="Norman Lamont">Norman Lamont</a> argued that if Britain left the EU, the EU would not impose retaliatory tariffs on British products, pointing out that the EU needed a trade agreement with Britain as German car manufacturers wanted to sell their cars to the world&apos;s fifth biggest market. Lamont argued that the <a href="/wiki/EFTA" class="mw-redirect" title="EFTA">EFTA</a> option was irrelevant and that Britain and the EU would agree on a trade pact which tailored to Britain&apos;s needs.</p><p><a href="/wiki/James_Dyson" title="James Dyson">James Dyson</a> argued that it would be self-defeating for the EU to impose retaliatory <a href="/wiki/Tariff" title="Tariff">tariffs</a> on British products because if the EU imposed a tariff on Britain, Britain would impose a retaliatory tariff on the EU, claiming that Britain bought 100&#xA0;billion pounds worth of the EU&apos;s goods and sold 10&#xA0;billion pounds worth of Britain&apos;s goods. However, proportionally, the government responded that &quot;EU exports to the UK are worth 3% of EU GDP, while UK exports to the EU are worth 13% of UK GDP &#x2013; four times more.&quot;</p><p>On 15 June 2016, <a href="/wiki/Vote_Leave" title="Vote Leave">Vote Leave</a>, the official Leave campaign, presented its roadmap to lay out what would happen if Britain left the EU. The blueprint suggested that Parliament would pass laws: Finance Bill to scrap VAT on <a href="/wiki/Tampon" title="Tampon">tampons</a> and household energy bills; Asylum and Immigration Control Bill to end the automatic right of EU citizens to enter Britain; National Health Service (Funding Target) Bill to get an extra 100 million pounds a week; European Union Law (Emergency Provisions) Bill; Free Trade Bill to start to negotiate its own deals with non-EU countries; and European Communities Act 1972 (Repeal) Bill to end the <a href="/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice" title="European Court of Justice">European Court of Justice</a>&apos;s jurisdiction over Britain and stop making contribution to the EU budget.</p><p>Some nations and cities may gain economic benefits from Brexit. In the wake of the vote, several global banks quickly began the process of shifting some operations out of <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> and into other European financial centres, including <a href="/wiki/Frankfurt" title="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Dublin" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>, in order to establish new legal domiciles in Europe in case London headquarters are no longer legally sufficient to serve the rest of the continent. While other European financial centres may benefit, those gains would come at a cost to London&apos;s global financial importance, as it is presumed London would lose those financial services jobs. For example, the day following the vote, <a href="/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase" title="JPMorgan Chase">JP Morgan Chase</a> CEO <a href="/wiki/Jamie_Dimon" title="Jamie Dimon">Jamie Dimon</a> told employees that the company &#x201C;may need to make changes to our legal entity structure and the location of some roles.&#x201D; Brexit may also lead to increased real estate prices in New York.

The negative outlook reflects the risk to economic prospects, fiscal and external performance, and the role of sterling as a reserve currency&quot;. On the other hand, economic analysts have pointed out that the UK, as a fiscally and monetarily sovereign nation, retains the ability to service or retire, at any time, any part or all of the state debt that is denominated in the <a href="/wiki/National_currency" class="mw-redirect" title="National currency">national currency</a>, and, hence, there is no risk whatsoever of defaulting on that part of its debt.</p><p>On 27 June 2016, Chancellor of the Exchequer <a href="/wiki/George_Osborne" title="George Osborne">George Osborne</a> attempted to reassure financial markets that the UK economy was not in serious trouble. This came after media reports that a survey by the <a href="/wiki/Institute_of_Directors" title="Institute of Directors">Institute of Directors</a> suggested that two thirds of businesses believed that the outcome of the referendum would produce negative results as well as the dropping value of the sterling and the FTSE 100, which began on 24 June 2016. British businesses had also predicted that investment cuts, hiring freezes and redundancies would be necessary to cope with the results of the referendum. Osborne indicated that Britain was facing the future &quot;from a position of strength&quot; and there was no current need for an emergency Budget. &quot;No one should doubt our resolve to maintain the fiscal stability we have delivered for this country ....

Former Labour Scottish First Minister <a href="/wiki/Henry_McLeish" title="Henry McLeish">Henry McLeish</a> has said that he would support Scottish independence under such circumstances.

There must be no attempts to remain inside the EU ... and no second referendum. ... Brexit means Brexit.&quot;</p><p>The United Kingdom can invoke article 50 of the European Treaty, which is the formal article in the European Union Treaty which deals with an exit from the union. After a British invocation of article 50, a negotiation period begins, which has a maximum duration of two years (counted from the invoking date, not the referendum date). If the negotiations are not finished within two years, then current negotiations between the UK and other EU countries will cease unless all countries agree to an extension. New treaties between the UK and the EU-countries could become more complicated, as the UK will leave the EU regardless of the negotiations. It is the Prime Minister&apos;s decision when to announce the article 50 withdrawal.</p><p>After the vote to leave was confirmed David Cameron did not immediately invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which is necessary in order to begin the formal process of withdrawal.

The EU has no framework to exclude the UK&#x2014;or any member&#x2014;as long as article 50 is not invoked. This does not prevent informal negotiations from taking place, for example through the media. Such media statements began quickly. For example, on June 29th, European Council president Donald Tusk told the UK that they won&apos;t be allowed access to the <a href="/wiki/Internal_market" title="Internal market">European Single Market</a> unless they accept all &quot;<a href="/wiki/Four_Freedoms_(European_Union)" class="mw-redirect" title="Four Freedoms (European Union)">four freedoms</a>&quot;, which include the free movement of goods, capital, services, and people.</p><p>Cameron has made it clear that the next Prime Minister should activate article 50 and begin negotiations with the EU.
