<p><i><b>Harry Potter</b></i> is a series of <a href="/wiki/Fantasy_literature" title="Fantasy literature">fantasy novels</a> written by <a href="/wiki/British_people" title="British people">British</a> author <a href="/wiki/J._K._Rowling" title="J.

<p>Since the release of the first novel, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone" title="Harry Potter and the Philosopher&apos;s Stone">Harry Potter and the Philosopher&apos;s Stone</a></i>, on 30 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity, critical acclaim and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers, and are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature. The series has also had its share of criticism, including concern about the increasingly dark tone as the series progressed, as well as the often gruesome and graphic violence it depicts. As of July 2013, the books have sold more than 450 million copies worldwide, making them the <a href="/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books" title="List of best-selling books">best-selling book series in history</a>, and have been <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_in_translation" title="Harry Potter in translation">translated into seventy-three languages</a>. The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history, with the final installment selling roughly eleven million copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release.</p>
<p>The series was originally published in English by two major publishers, <a href="/wiki/Bloomsbury_Publishing" title="Bloomsbury Publishing">Bloomsbury</a> in the United Kingdom and <a href="/wiki/Scholastic_Corporation" title="Scholastic Corporation">Scholastic Press</a> in the United States. A play, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Cursed_Child#Publication" title="Harry Potter and the Cursed Child">Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</a></i>, based on a story by Rowling, is set to premiere in London on 30 July 2016 at the <a href="/wiki/Palace_Theatre,_London" title="Palace Theatre, London">Palace Theatre</a>, and its script will subsequently be published by <a href="/wiki/Little,_Brown_Book_Group" title="Little, Brown Book Group">Little, Brown</a> as the eighth book in the series. The original seven books were adapted into an eight-part <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_(film_series)" title="Harry Potter (film series)">film series</a> by <a href="/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros. Pictures</a>, which has become the second <a href="/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_franchises_and_film_series" class="mw-redirect" title="List of highest-grossing franchises and film series">highest-grossing film series</a> of all time as of August 2015. The franchise has also generated much <a href="/wiki/Tie-in" title="Tie-in">tie-in</a> merchandise, making the <i>Harry Potter</i> brand worth in excess of $15&#xA0;billion.</p>
<p>A series of many <a href="/wiki/Genre" title="Genre">genres</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Fantasy" title="Fantasy">fantasy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Drama" title="Drama">drama</a>, <a href="/wiki/Coming_of_age" title="Coming of age">coming of age</a> and the British <a href="/wiki/School_story" title="School story">school story</a> (which includes elements of <a href="/wiki/Mystery_(fiction)" class="mw-redirect" title="Mystery (fiction)">mystery</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thriller_(genre)" title="Thriller (genre)">thriller</a>, <a href="/wiki/Adventure_novel" class="mw-redirect" title="Adventure novel">adventure</a>, <a href="/wiki/Horror_and_terror" title="Horror and terror">horror</a> and <a href="/wiki/Romance_novel" title="Romance novel">romance</a>), the world of <i>Harry Potter</i> explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references. According to Rowling, the main <a href="/wiki/Theme_(literature)" class="mw-redirect" title="Theme (literature)">theme</a> is death. Other major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, and madness.</p>
<p>The success of the books and films has ensured that the <i>Harry Potter</i> franchise continues to expand, with numerous <a href="/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter-related_topics" title="List of Harry Potter-related topics">derivative works</a>, a travelling exhibition that premiered in Chicago in 2009, a studio tour in London that opened in 2012, <a href="/wiki/Pottermore" title="Pottermore">a digital platform</a> on which J.K.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>

<p>The central character in the series is <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_(character)" title="Harry Potter (character)">Harry Potter</a>, an English orphan who discovers, at the age of eleven, that he is a <a href="/wiki/Magician_(fantasy)" title="Magician (fantasy)">wizard</a>, though he lives in the ordinary world of non-magical people known as <a href="/wiki/Muggles" class="mw-redirect" title="Muggles">Muggles</a>. The wizarding world exists parallel to the Muggle world, albeit hidden and in secrecy. His magical ability is inborn, and children with such abilities are invited to attend exclusive magic schools that teach the necessary skills to succeed in the <a href="/wiki/Wizarding_world" class="mw-redirect" title="Wizarding world">wizarding world</a>. Harry becomes a student at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts" title="Hogwarts">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>, a wizarding academy in Scotland, and it is here where most of the events in the series take place. As Harry develops through his adolescence, he learns to overcome the problems that face him: magical, social and emotional, including ordinary teenage challenges such as friendships, infatuation, romantic relationships, schoolwork and exams, anxiety, depression, stress, and the greater test of preparing himself for the confrontation in the real world that lies ahead, in wizarding Britain&apos;s increasingly-violent second wizarding war.</p>
<p>Each novel chronicles one year in Harry&apos;s life during the period from 1991 to 1998. The books also contain many <a href="/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)" title="Flashback (narrative)">flashbacks</a>, which are frequently experienced by Harry viewing the memories of other characters in a device called a <a href="/wiki/Pensieve" class="mw-redirect" title="Pensieve">Pensieve</a>.</p>
<p>The environment Rowling created is intimately connected to reality. The British magical community of the Harry Potter books is inspired by 1990s British culture, European folklore, classical mythology and <a href="/wiki/Alchemy" title="Alchemy">alchemy</a>, incorporating objects and wildlife such as <a href="/wiki/Wand" title="Wand">magic wands</a>, magic plants, potions, and spells, flying <a href="/wiki/Broomstick" class="mw-redirect" title="Broomstick">broomsticks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Centaur" title="Centaur">centaurs</a> and other magical creatures, the <a href="/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Deathly_Hallows" title="Magical objects in Harry Potter">Deathly Hallows</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Philosopher%27s_Stone" class="mw-redirect" title="Philosopher&apos;s Stone">Philosopher&apos;s Stone</a>, beside others invented by Rowling. While the <a href="/wiki/Fantasy_world" title="Fantasy world">fantasy land</a> of <a href="/wiki/Narnia_(world)" title="Narnia (world)">Narnia</a> is an <a href="/wiki/Parallel_universe_(fiction)" title="Parallel universe (fiction)">alternate universe</a> and the <i><a href="/wiki/Lord_of_the_Rings" class="mw-redirect" title="Lord of the Rings">Lord of the Rings</a></i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">&apos;</span> <a href="/wiki/Middle-earth" title="Middle-earth">Middle-earth</a> a mythic past, the wizarding world of <i>Harry Potter</i> exists in parallel within the real world and contains magical versions of the ordinary elements of everyday life, with the action mostly set in Scotland (Hogwarts), the West Country, Devon, London and Surrey in southeast England. The world only accessible to wizards and magical beings comprises a fragmented collection of overlooked hidden streets, ancient pubs, lonely country manors and secluded castles invisible to the Muggle population.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_years">Early years</span></h3>
<p>When the first novel of the series, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone" title="Harry Potter and the Philosopher&apos;s Stone">Harry Potter and the Philosopher&apos;s Stone</a></i> (published in America and other countries as <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&apos;s Stone</i>) opens, it is apparent that some significant event has taken place in the wizarding world &#x2013; an event so very remarkable, even the Muggles (non-magical people) notice signs of it. The full background to this event and Harry Potter&apos;s past is revealed gradually through the series. After the introductory chapter, the book leaps forward to a time shortly before Harry Potter&apos;s eleventh birthday, and it is at this point that his magical background begins to be revealed.</p>
<p>Harry&apos;s first contact with the wizarding world is through a half-giant, <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Rubeus Hagrid</a>, keeper of grounds and keys at Hogwarts. Hagrid reveals some of Harry&apos;s history. Harry learns that, as a baby, he witnessed his parents&apos; murder by the power-obsessed Dark wizard <a href="/wiki/Lord_Voldemort" title="Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a>, who subsequently attempted to kill him as well. For reasons not revealed until the fifth book, the spell with which Voldemort tried to kill Harry rebounded. Harry survived with only a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead as a memento of the attack, and Voldemort disappeared afterwards. As its inadvertent saviour from Voldemort&apos;s reign of terror, Harry has become a living legend in the wizarding world. However, at the orders of the venerable and well-known wizard <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>, the orphaned Harry had been placed in the home of his unpleasant <a href="/wiki/Muggle" title="Muggle">Muggle</a> relatives, the Dursleys, who kept him safe but treated him poorly, having him live in a cupboard and do chores while doting on their spoiled son Dudley. Petunia Dursley was jealous of her sister&apos;s magical abilities as a child, and later came to believe that all wizards were freaks. Therefore, the Dursleys hated wizards, so they hid Harry&apos;s true heritage from him, saying his parents died in a car crash in the hope that he would grow up &quot;normal&quot;.</p>
<p>With Hagrid&apos;s help, Harry prepares for and undertakes his first year of study at Hogwarts. As Harry begins to explore the magical world, the reader is introduced to many of the primary locations used throughout the series. Harry meets most of the main characters and gains his two closest friends: <a href="/wiki/Ron_Weasley" title="Ron Weasley">Ron Weasley</a>, a fun-loving member of an ancient, large, happy, but poor wizarding family, and <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a>, a gifted and very hardworking witch of non-magical parentage. Harry also encounters the school&apos;s potions master, <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>, who displays a conspicuously deep and abiding dislike for him, and the <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" class="mw-redirect" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> teacher, <a href="/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell" class="mw-redirect" title="Quirinus Quirrell">Quirinus Quirrell</a>, who later turns out to be controlled by Lord Voldemort. The first book concludes with Harry&apos;s second confrontation with Lord Voldemort, who, in his quest for immortality, yearns to gain the power of the <a href="/wiki/Sorcerer%27s_Stone" class="mw-redirect" title="Sorcerer&apos;s Stone">Philosopher&apos;s Stone</a>, a substance that bestows everlasting life.</p>
<p>The series continues with <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</a></i>, describing Harry&apos;s second year at Hogwarts. He and his friends investigate a 50-year-old mystery that appears uncannily related to recent sinister events at the school. Ron&apos;s younger sister, <a href="/wiki/Ginny_Weasley" class="mw-redirect" title="Ginny Weasley">Ginny Weasley</a>, enrolls in her first year at Hogwarts, and finds an old notebook which turns out to be Voldemort&apos;s diary from his school days. Ginny becomes possessed by Voldemort through the diary and unconsciously opens the &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;, unleashing an ancient monster, later revealed to be a basilisk, which begins attacking students at Hogwarts. The novel delves into the history of Hogwarts and a legend revolving around the Chamber that soon frightened everyone in the school. The book also introduces a new <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" class="mw-redirect" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> teacher, <a href="/wiki/Gilderoy_Lockhart" class="mw-redirect" title="Gilderoy Lockhart">Gilderoy Lockhart</a>, a highly cheerful, self-conceited wizard who goes around as if he is the most wonderful person who ever existed, who knows absolutely every single thing there is to know about everything, who later turns out to be a fraud. Harry discovers that prejudice exists in the wizarding world, and learns that Voldemort&apos;s reign of terror was often directed at wizards who were descended from Muggles. Harry also learns that his ability to speak the snake language <a href="/wiki/Parseltongue" class="mw-redirect" title="Parseltongue">Parseltongue</a> is rare and often associated with the <a href="/wiki/Black_magic" title="Black magic">Dark Arts</a>. The novel ends after Harry saves Ginny&apos;s life by destroying the <a href="/wiki/Basilisk_(Harry_Potter)" class="mw-redirect" title="Basilisk (Harry Potter)">basilisk</a> and the enchanted diary which has been the source of the problems.</p>
<p>The third novel, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></i>, follows Harry in his third year of magical education. It is the only book in the series which does not feature Lord Voldemort. Instead, Harry must deal with the knowledge that he has been targeted by <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" class="mw-redirect" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>, his father&apos;s best friend, and, according to the Wizarding World, an escaped mass murderer who assisted in the deaths of Harry&apos;s parents. As Harry struggles with his reaction to the <a href="/wiki/Dementors" class="mw-redirect" title="Dementors">dementors</a> &#x2013; dark creatures with the power to devour a human soul, which feed on despair &#x2013; which are ostensibly protecting the school, he reaches out to <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" class="mw-redirect" title="Remus Lupin">Remus Lupin</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" class="mw-redirect" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> teacher who is eventually revealed to be a <a href="/wiki/Werewolf" title="Werewolf">werewolf</a>. Lupin teaches Harry defensive measures which are well above the level of magic generally executed by people his age. Harry came to know that both Lupin and Black were best friends of his father and that Black was framed by their fourth friend, <a href="/wiki/Scabers" class="mw-redirect" title="Scabers">Peter Pettigrew</a>. In this book, a recurring theme throughout the series is emphasised &#x2013; in every book there is a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, none of whom lasts more than one school year.</p>

</div>
<p>During Harry&apos;s fourth year of school (detailed in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire" title="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a></i>), Harry is unwillingly entered as a participant in the Triwizard Tournament, a dangerous contest where three &quot;champions&quot;, one from each participating school, must compete with each other in three tasks in order to win the triwizard cup. This year, Harry must compete against a witch and a wizard &quot;champion&quot; from visiting schools Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, as well as another Hogwarts student, causing Harry&apos;s friends to distance themselves from him. Harry is guided through the tournament by their new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, <a href="/wiki/Mad-Eye_Moody" class="mw-redirect" title="Mad-Eye Moody">Alastor &quot;Mad-Eye&quot; Moody</a>, who turns out to be an impostor &#x2013; one of Voldemort&apos;s supporters named <a href="/wiki/Barty_Crouch,_Jr" class="mw-redirect" title="Barty Crouch, Jr">Barty Crouch, Jr</a>. in disguise. The point at which the mystery is unravelled marks the series&apos; shift from foreboding and uncertainty into open conflict. Voldemort&apos;s plan to have Crouch use the tournament to bring Harry to Voldemort succeeds. Although Harry manages to escape, <a href="/wiki/Cedric_Diggory" class="mw-redirect" title="Cedric Diggory">Cedric Diggory</a>, the other Hogwarts champion in the tournament, is killed by Peter Pettigrew and Voldemort re-enters the wizarding world with a physical body.</p>
<p>In the fifth book, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a></i>, Harry must confront the newly resurfaced Voldemort. In response to Voldemort&apos;s reappearance, Dumbledore re-activates the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix_(organisation)" class="mw-redirect" title="Order of the Phoenix (organisation)">Order of the Phoenix</a>, a secret society which works from Sirius Black&apos;s dark family home to defeat Voldemort&apos;s minions and protect Voldemort&apos;s targets, especially Harry. Despite Harry&apos;s description of Voldemort&apos;s recent activities, the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic" title="Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> and many others in the magical world refuse to believe that Voldemort has returned. In an attempt to counter and eventually discredit Dumbledore, who along with Harry is the most prominent voice in the wizarding world attempting to warn of Voldemort&apos;s return, the Ministry appoints <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" class="mw-redirect" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a> as the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts and the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. She transforms the school into a dictatorial regime and refuses to allow the students to learn ways to defend themselves against dark magic.</p>
<p>With Ron and Hermione&apos;s suggestion, Harry forms &quot;<a href="/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army" title="Dumbledore&apos;s Army">Dumbledore&apos;s Army</a>&quot;, a secret study group aimed to teach his classmates the higher-level skills of Defence Against the Dark Arts that he has learned from his previous encounters with Dark wizards. An important prophecy concerning Harry and Lord Voldemort is revealed, and Harry discovers that he and Voldemort have a painful connection, allowing Harry to view some of Voldemort&apos;s actions telepathically. In the novel&apos;s climax, Harry and his friends face off against Voldemort&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" class="mw-redirect" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic" title="Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a>.

<p>In the sixth book, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></i>, Voldemort begins waging open warfare. Harry and his friends are relatively protected from that danger at Hogwarts. They are subject to all the difficulties of adolescence &#x2013; Harry eventually begins dating Ginny, Ron establishes a strong infatuation with fellow Hogwarts student <a href="/wiki/Lavender_Brown" class="mw-redirect" title="Lavender Brown">Lavender Brown</a>, and Hermione starts to develop romantic feelings toward Ron. Near the beginning of the novel, lacking his own book, Harry is given an old potions textbook filled with many annotations and recommendations signed by a mysterious writer; &quot;the Half-Blood Prince.&quot; This book is a source of scholastic success and great recognition from their new potions master, <a href="/wiki/Horace_Slughorn" class="mw-redirect" title="Horace Slughorn">Horace Slughorn</a>, but because of the potency of the spells that are written in it, becomes a source of concern. Harry takes private lessons with Dumbledore, who shows him various memories concerning the early life of Voldemort in a device called a <a href="/wiki/Pensieve" class="mw-redirect" title="Pensieve">Pensieve</a>. These reveal that in order to preserve his life, Voldemort has split his soul into pieces, creating a series of <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" class="mw-redirect" title="Horcrux">horcruxes</a> &#x2013; evil enchanted items hidden in various locations, one of which was the diary destroyed in the second book. Harry&apos;s snobbish adversary, Draco Malfoy, attempts to attack Dumbledore, and the book culminates in the killing of Dumbledore by <a href="/wiki/Professor_Snape" class="mw-redirect" title="Professor Snape">Professor Snape</a>, the titular Half-Blood Prince.</p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></i>, the last book in the series, begins directly after the events of the sixth book. Lord Voldemort has completed his ascension to power and gained control of the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron and Hermione drop out of school so that they can find and destroy Voldemort&apos;s remaining horcruxes. To ensure their own safety as well as that of their family and friends, they are forced to isolate themselves. As they search for the horcruxes, the trio learns details about Dumbledore&apos;s past, as well as Snape&apos;s true motives &#x2013; he had worked on Dumbledore&apos;s behalf since the murder of Harry&apos;s mother. Snape is killed by Voldemort out of paranoia.</p>
<p>The book culminates in the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry, Ron and Hermione, in conjunction with members of the Order of the Phoenix and many of the teachers and students, defend Hogwarts from Voldemort, his Death Eaters, and various dangerous <a href="/wiki/Magical_creatures_(Harry_Potter)" class="mw-redirect" title="Magical creatures (Harry Potter)">magical creatures</a>. Several major characters are killed in the first wave of the battle, including <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" class="mw-redirect" title="Remus Lupin">Remus Lupin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fred_Weasley" class="mw-redirect" title="Fred Weasley">Fred Weasley</a>. After learning that he himself is a horcrux, Harry surrenders himself to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest, who casts a killing curse (Avada Kedavra) at him. The defenders of Hogwarts do not surrender after learning of Harry&apos;s presumed death and continue to fight on. Harry awakens and faces Voldemort, whose horcruxes have all been destroyed. In the final battle, Voldemort&apos;s killing curse rebounds off Harry&apos;s defensive spell (Expelliarmus) killing Voldemort. Also, as most viewers saw coming, Harry Potter marries and has children with Ginny <a href="/wiki/Weasley" class="mw-redirect" title="Weasley">Weasley</a> and Hermione Granger marries and has children with Ronald Weasley.</p>
<p>An epilogue describes the lives of the surviving characters and the effects of Voldemort&apos;s death on the wizarding world. It also introduces the children of all the characters.</p>

<p>Rowling has expanded the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_universe" class="mw-redirect" title="Harry Potter universe">Harry Potter universe</a> with several short books produced for various charities. In 2001, she released <i><a href="/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them" title="Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</a></i> (a purported Hogwarts textbook) and <i><a href="/wiki/Quidditch_Through_the_Ages" title="Quidditch Through the Ages">Quidditch Through the Ages</a></i> (a book Harry reads for fun). Proceeds from the sale of these two books benefitted the charity <a href="/wiki/Comic_Relief" title="Comic Relief">Comic Relief</a>. In 2007, Rowling composed seven handwritten copies of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Tales_of_Beedle_the_Bard" title="The Tales of Beedle the Bard">The Tales of Beedle the Bard</a></i>, a collection of fairy tales that is featured in the final novel, one of which was auctioned to raise money for the Children&apos;s High Level Group, a fund for mentally disabled children in poor countries. The book was published internationally on 4 December 2008. Rowling also wrote an 800-word <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_prequel" title="Harry Potter prequel">prequel</a> in 2008 as part of a fundraiser organised by the bookseller <a href="/wiki/Waterstones" title="Waterstones">Waterstones</a>. All three of these books contain extra information about the wizarding world not included in the original novels.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Pottermore_website">Pottermore website</span></h4>
<p>In 2011, Rowling launched a new website announcing an upcoming project called <a href="/wiki/Pottermore" title="Pottermore">Pottermore</a>. Pottermore opened to the general public on 14 April 2012. Pottermore allows users to be sorted, be chosen by their wand and play various minigames. The main purpose of the website was to allow the user to journey though the story with access to content not revealed by JK Rowling previously, with over 18,000 words of additional content.</p>
<p>In September 2015 the website was completely overhauled and most of the features were removed. The site has been redesigned and it mainly focuses on the information already available, rather than exploration.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Structure_and_genre">Structure and genre</span></h2>
<p>The <i>Harry Potter</i> novels are mainly directed at a young adult audience as opposed to an audience of middle grade readers, children, or adults. The novels fall within the genre of <a href="/wiki/Fantasy_literature" title="Fantasy literature">fantasy literature</a>, and qualify as a unique type of fantasy called &quot;urban fantasy&quot;, &quot;contemporary fantasy&quot;, or &quot;low fantasy&quot;. They are mainly dramas, and maintain a fairly serious and dark tone throughout, though they do contain some notable instances of <a href="/wiki/Tragicomedy" title="Tragicomedy">tragicomedy</a> and black humour. In many respects, they are also examples of the <i><a href="/wiki/Bildungsroman" title="Bildungsroman">bildungsroman</a></i>, or <a href="/wiki/Coming_of_age" title="Coming of age">coming of age</a> novel, and contain elements of <a href="/wiki/Mystery_(fiction)" class="mw-redirect" title="Mystery (fiction)">mystery</a>, adventure, <a href="/wiki/Horror_fiction" title="Horror fiction">horror</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thriller_(genre)" title="Thriller (genre)">thriller</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Romance_novel" title="Romance novel">romance</a>. They can be considered part of the British children&apos;s <a href="/wiki/School_story" title="School story">boarding school genre</a>, which includes <a href="/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling" title="Rudyard Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Stalky_%26_Co." title="Stalky &amp; Co.">Stalky &amp; Co.</a>, <a href="/wiki/Enid_Blyton" title="Enid Blyton">Enid Blyton</a>&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/Malory_Towers" title="Malory Towers">Malory Towers</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/St._Clare%27s_series" class="mw-redirect" title="St. Clare&apos;s series">St. Clare&apos;s</a></i> and the <i><a href="/wiki/Naughtiest_Girl" class="mw-redirect" title="Naughtiest Girl">Naughtiest Girl</a></i> series, and <a href="/wiki/Charles_Hamilton_(writer)" title="Charles Hamilton (writer)">Frank Richards&apos;s</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Billy_Bunter" title="Billy Bunter">Billy Bunter</a></i> novels: the <i>Harry Potter</i> books are predominantly set in <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts" title="Hogwarts">Hogwarts</a>, a fictional British boarding school for wizards, where the curriculum includes the use of <a href="/wiki/Magic_(Harry_Potter)" class="mw-redirect" title="Magic (Harry Potter)">magic</a>. In this sense they are &quot;in a direct line of descent from <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Hughes" title="Thomas Hughes">Thomas Hughes</a>&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/Tom_Brown%27s_School_Days" title="Tom Brown&apos;s School Days">Tom Brown&apos;s School Days</a></i> and other Victorian and Edwardian novels of <a href="/wiki/Public_school_(UK)" class="mw-redirect" title="Public school (UK)">British public school</a> life&quot;, though they are, as many note, more contemporary, grittier, darker, and more mature than the typical boarding school novel, addressing serious themes of death, love, loss, prejudice, coming-of-age, and the loss of innocence in a 1990&apos;s British setting.</p>
<p>The books are also, in the words of <a href="/wiki/Stephen_King" title="Stephen King">Stephen King</a>, &quot;shrewd mystery tales&quot;, and each book is constructed in the manner of a <a href="/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes" title="Sherlock Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>-style <a href="/wiki/Mystery_fiction" title="Mystery fiction">mystery</a> adventure. The stories are told from a <a href="/wiki/Third_person_limited" class="mw-redirect" title="Third person limited">third person limited</a> point of view with very few exceptions (such as the opening chapters of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone" title="Harry Potter and the Philosopher&apos;s Stone">Philosopher&apos;s Stone</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire" title="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire">Goblet of Fire</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">Deathly Hallows</a></i> and the first two chapters of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Half-Blood Prince</a></i>).</p>
<p>In the middle of each book, Harry struggles with the problems he encounters, and dealing with them often involves the need to violate some school rules. If students are caught breaking rules, they are often disciplined by Hogwarts professors. However, the stories reach their climax in the <a href="/wiki/Summer_term" title="Summer term">summer term</a>, near or just after <a href="/wiki/Final_examination" title="Final examination">final exams</a>, when events escalate far beyond in-school squabbles and struggles, and Harry must confront either <a href="/wiki/Voldemort" class="mw-redirect" title="Voldemort">Voldemort</a> or one of his followers, the <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" class="mw-redirect" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a>, with the stakes a matter of life and death&#x2013;a point underlined, as the series progresses, by one or more characters being killed in each of the final four books. In the aftermath, he learns important lessons through exposition and discussions with head teacher and <a href="/wiki/Mentor" class="mw-redirect" title="Mentor">mentor</a> <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>. In the final novel, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></i>, Harry and his friends spend most of their time away from Hogwarts, and only return there to face Voldemort at the <i><a href="/wiki/D%C3%A9nouement" class="mw-redirect" title="D&#xE9;nouement">d&#xE9;nouement</a></i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Themes">Themes</span></h2>
<p>According to Rowling, a major theme in the series is death: &quot;My books are largely about death. They open with the death of Harry&apos;s parents. There is Voldemort&apos;s obsession with conquering death and his quest for <a href="/wiki/Immortality" title="Immortality">immortality</a> at any price, the goal of anyone with magic. I so understand why Voldemort wants to conquer death. We&apos;re all frightened of it.&quot;</p>
<p>Academics and journalists have developed many other interpretations of themes in the books, some more complex than others, and some including <a href="/wiki/Politics_of_Harry_Potter" title="Politics of Harry Potter">political subtexts</a>. Themes such as <a href="/wiki/Normality_(behavior)" title="Normality (behavior)">normality</a>, oppression, survival, and overcoming imposing odds have all been considered as prevalent throughout the series. Similarly, the theme of making one&apos;s way through adolescence and &quot;going over one&apos;s most harrowing ordeals &#x2013; and thus coming to terms with them&quot; has also been considered. Rowling has stated that the books comprise &quot;a prolonged argument for tolerance, a prolonged plea for an end to <a href="/wiki/Bigotry" title="Bigotry">bigotry</a>&quot; and that they also pass on a message to &quot;question authority and... not assume that the establishment or the press tells you all of the truth&quot;.</p>
<p>While the books could be said to comprise many other themes, such as power/abuse of power, violence and hatred, love, loss, prejudice, and free choice, they are, as Rowling states, &quot;deeply entrenched in the whole plot&quot;; the writer prefers to let themes &quot;grow organically&quot;, rather than sitting down and consciously attempting to impart such ideas to her readers. Along the same lines is the ever-present theme of adolescence, in whose depiction Rowling has been purposeful in acknowledging her characters&apos; sexualities and not leaving Harry, as she put it, &quot;stuck in a state of permanent pre-pubescence&quot;. Rowling has also been praised for her nuanced depiction of the ways in which death and violence affects youth, and humanity as a whole.</p>
<p>Rowling said that, to her, the moral significance of the tales seems &quot;blindingly obvious&quot;. The key for her was the choice between what is right and what is easy, &quot;because that &#x2026; is how tyranny is started, with people being <a href="/wiki/Apathetic" class="mw-redirect" title="Apathetic">apathetic</a> and taking the easy route and suddenly finding themselves in deep trouble.&quot;</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Origins">Origins</span></h2>

<p>In 1990, Rowling was on a crowded train from <a href="/wiki/Manchester" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> to London when the idea for Harry suddenly &quot;fell into her head&quot;. Rowling gives an account of the experience on her website saying:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>&quot;I had been writing almost continuously since the age of six but I had never been so excited about an idea before. I simply sat and thought, for four (delayed train) hours, and all the details bubbled up in my brain, and this scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who did not know he was a wizard became more and more real to me.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rowling completed <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher&apos;s Stone</i> in 1995 and the <a href="/wiki/Manuscript" title="Manuscript">manuscript</a> was sent off to several prospective <a href="/wiki/Literary_agent" title="Literary agent">agents</a>. The second agent she tried, Christopher Little, offered to represent her and sent the manuscript to Bloomsbury.</p>

<p>After eight other publishers had rejected <i>Philosopher&apos;s Stone</i>, Bloomsbury offered Rowling a &#xA3;2,500 advance for its publication. Despite Rowling&apos;s statement that she did not have any particular <a href="/wiki/Demographic_profile" title="Demographic profile">age group</a> in mind when beginning to write the <i>Harry Potter</i> books, the publishers initially targeted children aged nine to eleven. On the eve of publishing, Rowling was asked by her publishers to adopt a more <a href="/wiki/Epicenity" class="mw-redirect" title="Epicenity">gender-neutral</a> pen name in order to appeal to the male members of this age group, fearing that they would not be interested in reading a novel they knew to be written by a woman. She elected to use J. K. Rowling (Joanne Kathleen Rowling), using her grandmother&apos;s name as her second name because she has no <a href="/wiki/Middle_name" title="Middle name">middle name</a>.</p>
<p><i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher&apos;s Stone</i> was published by <a href="/wiki/Bloomsbury_Publishing" title="Bloomsbury Publishing">Bloomsbury</a>, the publisher of all <i>Harry Potter</i> books in the United Kingdom, on 30 June 1997. It was released in the United States on 1 September 1998 by <a href="/wiki/Scholastic_Press" class="mw-redirect" title="Scholastic Press">Scholastic</a> &#x2013; the American publisher of the books &#x2013; as <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&apos;s Stone</i>, after Rowling had received US$105,000 for the American rights &#x2013; an unprecedented amount for a children&apos;s book by a then-unknown author. Fearing that American readers would not associate the word &quot;philosopher&quot; with a magical theme (although the <a href="/wiki/Philosopher%27s_Stone" class="mw-redirect" title="Philosopher&apos;s Stone">Philosopher&apos;s Stone</a> is alchemy-related), Scholastic insisted that the book be given the title <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&apos;s Stone</i> for the American market.</p>
<p>The second book, <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i> was originally published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and in the US on 2 June 1999. <i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i> was then published a year later in the UK on 8 July 1999 and in the US on 8 September 1999. <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i> was published on 8 July 2000 at the same time by <a href="/wiki/Bloomsbury" title="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scholastic_Press" class="mw-redirect" title="Scholastic Press">Scholastic</a>. <i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</i> is the longest book in the series at 766 pages in the UK version and 870 pages in the US version. It was published worldwide in English on 21 June 2003. <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i> was published on 16 July 2005, and it sold 9 million copies in the first 24 hours of its worldwide release. The seventh and final novel, <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>, was published on 21 July 2007. The book sold 11 million copies in the first 24 hours of release, breaking down to 2.7 million copies in the UK and 8.3 million in the US.</p>

<p>In December 2005, Rowling stated on her web site, &quot;2006 will be the year when I write the final book in the <i>Harry Potter</i> series.&quot; Updates then followed in her <a href="/wiki/Online_diary" title="Online diary">online diary</a> chronicling the progress of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></i>, with the release date of 21 July 2007. The book itself was finished on 11 January 2007 in the <a href="/wiki/Balmoral_Hotel" title="Balmoral Hotel">Balmoral Hotel</a>, Edinburgh, where she scrawled a message on the back of a bust of <a href="/wiki/Hermes" title="Hermes">Hermes</a>. It read: &quot;J. K. Rowling finished writing <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i> in this room (552) on 11 January 2007.&quot;</p>
<p>Rowling herself has stated that the last chapter of the final book (in fact, the epilogue) was completed &quot;in something like 1990&quot;. In June 2006, Rowling, on an appearance on the British talk show <i><a href="/wiki/Richard_%26_Judy" title="Richard &amp; Judy">Richard &amp; Judy</a></i>, announced that the chapter had been modified as one character &quot;got a reprieve&quot; and two others who previously survived the story had in fact been killed. On 28 March 2007, the cover art for the Bloomsbury Adult and Child versions and the Scholastic version were released.</p>
<p>In September 2012, Rowling mentioned in an interview that she might go back to make a &quot;director&apos;s cut&quot; of two of the existing <i>Harry Potter</i> books.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cover_art">Cover art</span></h3>
<p>For cover art, Bloomsbury chose painted art in a classic style of design, with the first cover a watercolour and pencil drawing by illustrator <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Taylor_(artist)" title="Thomas Taylor (artist)">Thomas Taylor</a> showing Harry boarding the Hogwarts Express, and a title in the font <a href="/wiki/Cochin_(typeface)" title="Cochin (typeface)">Cochin Bold</a>. The first releases of the successive books in the series followed in the same style but somewhat more realistic, illustrating scenes from the books. These covers were created by first <a href="/wiki/Cliff_Wright" title="Cliff Wright">Cliff Wright</a> and then Jason Cockroft.</p>
<p>Due to the appeal of the books among an adult audience, Bloomsbury commissioned a second line of editions in an &apos;adult&apos; style. These initially used black-and-white photographic art for the covers showing objects from the books (including a very American Hogwarts Express) without depicting people, but later shifted to partial colourisation with a picture of Slytherin&apos;s locket on the cover of the final book.</p>
<p>International and later editions have been created by a range of designers, including <a href="/wiki/Mary_GrandPr%C3%A9" title="Mary GrandPr&#xE9;">Mary GrandPr&#xE9;</a> for U.S. audiences and <a href="/wiki/Mika_Launis" title="Mika Launis">Mika Launis</a> in Finland. For a later American release, <a href="/wiki/Kazu_Kibuishi" title="Kazu Kibuishi">Kazu Kibuishi</a> created covers in a somewhat anime-influenced style.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cultural_impact">Cultural impact</span></h3>

<p>Fans of the series were so eager for the latest instalment that bookstores around the world began holding events to coincide with the midnight release of the books, beginning with the 2000 publication of <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i>. The events, commonly featuring mock sorting, games, face painting, and other live entertainment have achieved popularity with Potter fans and have been highly successful in attracting fans and selling books with nearly nine million of the 10.8 million initial print copies of <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i> sold in the first 24 hours.</p>
<p>The final book in the series, <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i> became the fastest selling book in history, moving 11 million units in the first twenty-four hours of release. The series has also gathered adult fans, leading to the release of two editions of each <i>Harry Potter</i> book, identical in text but with one edition&apos;s cover artwork aimed at children and the other aimed at adults. Besides meeting online through blogs, <a href="/wiki/Podcast" title="Podcast">podcasts</a>, and fansites, <i>Harry Potter</i> super-fans can also meet at <i>Harry Potter</i> <a href="/wiki/Academic_conference" title="Academic conference">symposia</a>.</p>
<p>The word <i>Muggle</i> has spread beyond its <i>Harry Potter</i> origins, becoming one of few pop culture words to land in the <a href="/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary" title="Oxford English Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>. The Harry Potter fandom has embraced podcasts as a regular, often weekly, insight to the latest discussion in the fandom. Both <a href="/wiki/MuggleCast" class="mw-redirect" title="MuggleCast">MuggleCast</a> and <a href="/wiki/PotterCast" title="PotterCast">PotterCast</a> have reached the top spot of iTunes podcast rankings and have been polled one of the top 50 favourite podcasts.</p>
<p>Some lessons identified in the series include diversity, acceptance, political tolerance, and equality. Surveys of over 1,000 college students in the United States show that those who read the books were significantly different than those who had not. Readers of the series were found to be more tolerant, more opposed to violence and torture, less authoritarian, and less cynical. Although we cannot know if this is a cause-and-effect relationship, there is a clear correlation, and it seems that Harry Potter&apos;s cultural impact may be stronger than just a fandom bond.</p>

<p>The popularity of the <i>Harry Potter</i> series has translated into substantial financial success for Rowling, her publishers, and other <i>Harry Potter</i> related license holders. This success has made Rowling the first and thus far only billionaire author. The books have sold more than 400 million copies worldwide and have also given rise to the popular <a href="/wiki/Film_adaptation" title="Film adaptation">film adaptations</a> produced by <a href="/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films" title="List of highest-grossing films">all of which have been highly successful in their own right</a>. The films have in turn spawned eight video games and have led to the licensing of more than 400 additional Harry Potter products . The Harry Potter brand has been estimated to be worth as much as $15&#xA0;billion.</p>
<p>The great demand for Harry Potter books motivated the <i>New York Times</i> to create a separate best-seller list for children&apos;s literature in 2000, just before the release of <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i>. By 24 June 2000, Rowling&apos;s novels had been on the list for 79 straight weeks; the first three novels were each on the hardcover best-seller list. On 12 April 2007, <a href="/wiki/Barnes_%26_Noble" title="Barnes &amp; Noble">Barnes &amp; Noble</a> declared that <i>Deathly Hallows</i> had broken its <a href="/wiki/Pre-order" title="Pre-order">pre-order</a> record, with more than 500,000 copies pre-ordered through its site. For the release of <i>Goblet of Fire</i>, 9,000 <a href="/wiki/FedEx" title="FedEx">FedEx</a> trucks were used with no other purpose than to deliver the book. Together, Amazon.com and <a href="/wiki/Barnes_%26_Noble" title="Barnes &amp; Noble">Barnes &amp; Noble</a> pre-sold more than 700,000 copies of the book. In the United States, the book&apos;s initial printing run was 3.8&#xA0;million copies. This record statistic was broken by <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a></i>, with 8.5&#xA0;million, which was then shattered by <i>Half-Blood Prince</i> with 10.8&#xA0;million copies. 6.9&#xA0;million copies of <i>Prince</i> were sold in the U.S. within the first 24 hours of its release; in the United Kingdom more than two million copies were sold on the first day. The initial U.S. print run for <i>Deathly Hallows</i> was 12&#xA0;million copies, and more than a million were pre-ordered through Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Awards.2C_honours.2C_and_recognition">Awards, honours, and recognition</span></h3>
<p>The <i>Harry Potter</i> series has been recognised by a host of awards since the initial publication of <i>Philosopher&apos;s Stone</i> including four Whitaker Platinum Book Awards (all of which were awarded in 2001), three <a href="/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9_Smarties_Book_Prize" title="Nestl&#xE9; Smarties Book Prize">Nestl&#xE9; Smarties Book Prizes</a> (1997&#x2013;1999), two <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Arts_Council" title="Scottish Arts Council">Scottish Arts Council Book Awards</a> (1999 and 2001), the inaugural <a href="/wiki/Costa_Book_Awards" title="Costa Book Awards">Whitbread children&apos;s book of the year award</a> (1999), the <a href="/wiki/British_Book_Awards" class="mw-redirect" title="British Book Awards">WHSmith book of the year</a> (2006), among others. In 2000, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></i> was nominated for a <a href="/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Novel" title="Hugo Award for Best Novel">Hugo Award for Best Novel</a>, and in 2001, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire" title="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a></i> won said award. Honours include a commendation for the <a href="/wiki/Carnegie_Medal_(literary_award)" title="Carnegie Medal (literary award)">Carnegie Medal</a> (1997), a short listing for the <a href="/wiki/Guardian_Award" class="mw-redirect" title="Guardian Award">Guardian Children&apos;s Award</a> (1998), and numerous listings on the notable books, editors&apos; Choices, and best books lists of the <a href="/wiki/American_Library_Association" title="American Library Association">American Library Association</a>, <i>The New York Times</i>, <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Public_Library" title="Chicago Public Library">Chicago Public Library</a>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Publishers_Weekly" title="Publishers Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a></i>.</p>
<p>A 2004 study found that books in the series were commonly read aloud in elementary schools in <a href="/wiki/San_Diego_County,_California" title="San Diego County, California">San Diego County, California</a>. Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S. <a href="/wiki/National_Education_Association" title="National Education Association">National Education Association</a> listed the series in its &quot;Teachers&apos; Top 100 Books for Children&quot;. Three of the books placed among the &quot;Top 100 Chapter Books&quot; of all time, or children&apos;s novels, in a 2012 survey published by <i><a href="/wiki/School_Library_Journal" title="School Library Journal">School Library Journal</a></i>: <i>Sorcerer&apos;s Stone</i> ranked number three, <i>Prisoner of Azkaban</i> 12th, and <i>Goblet of Fire</i> 98th.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reception">Reception</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Literary_criticism">Literary criticism</span></h3>
<p>Early in its history, <i>Harry Potter</i> received positive reviews. On publication, the first book, <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher&apos;s Stone</i>, attracted attention from the Scottish newspapers, such as <i><a href="/wiki/The_Scotsman" title="The Scotsman">The Scotsman</a></i>, which said it had &quot;all the makings of a classic&quot;, and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Herald_(Glasgow)" title="The Herald (Glasgow)">The Glasgow Herald</a></i>, which called it &quot;Magic stuff&quot;. Soon the English newspapers joined in, with more than one comparing it to <a href="/wiki/Roald_Dahl" title="Roald Dahl">Roald Dahl</a>&apos;s work: <i><a href="/wiki/The_Mail_on_Sunday" title="The Mail on Sunday">The Mail on Sunday</a></i> rated it as &quot;the most imaginative debut since <a href="/wiki/Roald_Dahl" title="Roald Dahl">Roald Dahl</a>&quot;, a view echoed by <i><a href="/wiki/The_Sunday_Times" title="The Sunday Times">The Sunday Times</a></i> (&quot;comparisons to Dahl are, this time, justified&quot;), while <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> called it &quot;a richly textured novel given lift-off by an inventive wit&quot;.</p>
<p>By the time of the release of the fifth book, <i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,</i> the books began to receive strong criticism from a number of literary scholars. Yale professor, literary scholar, and critic <a href="/wiki/Harold_Bloom" title="Harold Bloom">Harold Bloom</a> raised criticisms of the books&apos; literary merits, saying, &quot;Rowling&apos;s mind is so governed by clich&#xE9;s and dead metaphors that she has no other style of writing.&quot; <a href="/wiki/A._S._Byatt" title="A. S. Byatt">A. S. Byatt</a> authored a <i>New York Times</i> op-ed article calling Rowling&apos;s universe a &quot;secondary secondary world, made up of intelligently patchworked derivative motifs from all sorts of children&apos;s literature&#xA0;... written for people whose imaginative lives are confined to TV cartoons, and the exaggerated (more exciting, not threatening) mirror-worlds of soaps, reality TV and celebrity gossip&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Michael_Rosen" title="Michael Rosen">Michael Rosen</a>, a novelist and poet, advocated the books were not suited for children, who would be unable to grasp the complex themes. Rosen also stated that &quot;J. K. Rowling is more of an adult writer.&quot; The critic <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Holden" title="Anthony Holden">Anthony Holden</a> wrote in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Observer" title="The Observer">The Observer</a></i> on his experience of judging <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></i> for the <a href="/wiki/1999_Whitbread_Awards" title="1999 Whitbread Awards">1999 Whitbread Awards</a>. His overall view of the series was negative &#x2013; &quot;the Potter saga was essentially patronising, conservative, highly derivative, dispiritingly nostalgic for a bygone Britain&quot;, and he speaks of &quot;a pedestrian, ungrammatical prose style&quot;. <a href="/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin" title="Ursula K. Le Guin">Ursula K. Le Guin</a> said, &quot;I have no great opinion of it. When so many adult critics were carrying on about the &apos;incredible originality&apos; of the first Harry Potter book, I read it to find out what the fuss was about, and remained somewhat puzzled; it seemed a lively kid&apos;s fantasy crossed with a &quot;school novel&quot;, good fare for its age group, but stylistically ordinary, imaginatively derivative, and ethically rather mean-spirited.&quot;</p>
<p>By contrast, author <a href="/wiki/Fay_Weldon" title="Fay Weldon">Fay Weldon</a>, while admitting that the series is &quot;not what the poets hoped for&quot;, nevertheless goes on to say, &quot;but this is not poetry, it is readable, saleable, everyday, useful prose&quot;. The literary critic A. N. Wilson praised the Harry Potter series in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Times" title="The Times">The Times</a></i>, stating: &quot;There are not many writers who have JK&apos;s Dickensian ability to make us turn the pages, to weep &#x2013; openly, with tears splashing &#x2013; and a few pages later to laugh, at invariably good jokes&#xA0;... We have lived through a decade in which we have followed the publication of the liveliest, funniest, scariest and most moving children&apos;s stories ever written&quot;. Charles Taylor of <a href="/wiki/Salon.com" class="mw-redirect" title="Salon.com">Salon.com</a>, who is primarily a movie critic, took issue with Byatt&apos;s criticisms in particular. While he conceded that she may have &quot;a valid cultural point &#x2013; a teeny one &#x2013; about the impulses that drive us to reassuring pop trash and away from the troubling complexities of art&quot;, he rejected her claims that the series is lacking in serious <a href="/wiki/Literary_merit" title="Literary merit">literary merit</a> and that it owes its success merely to the childhood reassurances it offers. Taylor stressed the progressively darker tone of the books, shown by the murder of a classmate and close friend and the psychological wounds and <a href="/wiki/Social_isolation" title="Social isolation">social isolation</a> each causes. Taylor also argued that <i>Philosopher&apos;s Stone</i>, said to be the most light-hearted of the seven published books, disrupts the childhood reassurances that Byatt claims spur the series&apos; success: the book opens with news of a <a href="/wiki/Double_murder" class="mw-redirect" title="Double murder">double murder</a>, for example.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Stephen_King" title="Stephen King">Stephen King</a> called the series &quot;a feat of which only a superior imagination is capable&quot;, and declared &quot;Rowling&apos;s punning, one-eyebrow-cocked sense of humor&quot; to be &quot;remarkable&quot;. However, he wrote that despite the story being &quot;a good one&quot;, he is &quot;a little tired of discovering Harry at home with his horrible aunt and uncle&quot;, the formulaic beginning of all seven books. King has also joked that &quot;Rowling&apos;s never met an adverb she did not like!&quot; He does however predict that Harry Potter &quot;will indeed stand time&apos;s test and wind up on a shelf where only the best are kept; I think Harry will take his place with <a href="/wiki/Alice_(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland)" title="Alice (Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland)">Alice</a>, <a href="/wiki/Huckleberry_Finn" title="Huckleberry Finn">Huck</a>, <a href="/wiki/Frodo_Baggins" title="Frodo Baggins">Frodo</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Dorothy_Gale" title="Dorothy Gale">Dorothy</a> and this is one series not just for the decade, but for the ages&quot;.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_impact">Social impact</span></h3>
<p>Although <a href="/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)"><i>Time</i> magazine</a> named Rowling as a runner-up for its 2007 <a href="/wiki/Time_Person_of_the_Year" title="Time Person of the Year">Person of the Year</a> award, noting the social, moral, and <a href="/wiki/Politics_of_Harry_Potter" title="Politics of Harry Potter">political inspiration</a> she has given <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_fandom" title="Harry Potter fandom">her fandom</a>, cultural comments on the series have been mixed. <i><a href="/wiki/Washington_Post" class="mw-redirect" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a></i> book critic Ron Charles opined in July 2007 that the large numbers of adults reading the <i>Potter</i> series but few other books may represent a &quot;bad case of cultural infantilism&quot;, and that the straightforward &quot;good vs. evil&quot; theme of the series is &quot;childish&quot;. He also argued &quot;through no fault of Rowling&apos;s&quot;, the cultural and marketing &quot;hysteria&quot; marked by the publication of the later books &quot;trains children and adults to expect the roar of the coliseum, a mass-media experience that no other novel can possibly provide&quot;.</p>
<p>Librarian Nancy Knapp pointed out the books&apos; potential to improve <a href="/wiki/Literacy" title="Literacy">literacy</a> by motivating children to read much more than they otherwise would. The seven-book series has a word count of 1,083,594 (US edition). Agreeing about the motivating effects, Diane Penrod also praised the books&apos; blending of simple entertainment with &quot;the qualities of highbrow literary fiction&quot;, but expressed concern about the distracting effect of the prolific <a href="/wiki/Merchandising" title="Merchandising">merchandising</a> that accompanies the book launches. However, the assumption that Harry Potter books have increased literacy among young people is &quot;largely a folk legend.&quot; Research by the <a href="/wiki/National_Endowment_for_the_Arts" title="National Endowment for the Arts">National Endowment for the Arts</a> (NEA) has found no increase in reading among children coinciding with the Harry Potter publishing phenomenon, nor has the broader downward trend in reading among Americans been arrested during the rise in the popularity of the Harry Potter books. The research also found that children who read Harry Potter books were not more likely to go on to read outside the fantasy and mystery genres. NEA chairman <a href="/wiki/Dana_Gioia" title="Dana Gioia">Dana Gioia</a> said the series, &quot;got millions of kids to read a long and reasonably complex series of books. The trouble is that one Harry Potter novel every few years is not enough to reverse the decline in reading.&quot;</p>
<p>Jennifer Conn used Snape&apos;s and Quidditch coach Madam Hooch&apos;s teaching methods as examples of what to avoid and what to emulate in clinical teaching, and Joyce Fields wrote that the books illustrate four of the five main topics in a typical first-year sociology class: &quot;sociological concepts including culture, society, and <a href="/wiki/Socialisation" class="mw-redirect" title="Socialisation">socialisation</a>; <a href="/wiki/Social_stratification" title="Social stratification">stratification</a> and <a href="/wiki/Social_inequality" title="Social inequality">social inequality</a>; <a href="/wiki/Social_institutions" class="mw-redirect" title="Social institutions">social institutions</a>; and <a href="/wiki/Social_theory" title="Social theory">social theory</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>Jenny Sawyer wrote in <i><a href="/wiki/Christian_Science_Monitor" class="mw-redirect" title="Christian Science Monitor">Christian Science Monitor</a></i> on 25 July 2007 that the books represent a &quot;disturbing trend in commercial storytelling and Western society&quot; in that stories &quot;moral center [sic] have all but vanished from much of today&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Popular_culture" title="Popular culture">pop culture</a>&#xA0;... after 10 years, 4,195 pages, and over 375 million copies, J. K. Rowling&apos;s towering achievement lacks the cornerstone of almost all great children&apos;s literature: the hero&apos;s moral journey&quot;. Harry Potter, Sawyer argues, neither faces a &quot;moral struggle&quot; nor undergoes any ethical growth, and is thus &quot;no guide in circumstances in which right and wrong are anything less than black and white&quot;. In contrast Emily Griesinger described Harry&apos;s first passage through to <a href="/wiki/Platform_9%C2%BE" class="mw-redirect" title="Platform 9&#xBE;">Platform 9&#xBE;</a> as an application of faith and hope, and his encounter with the Sorting Hat as the first of many in which Harry is shaped by the choices he makes. She also noted the &quot;deeper magic&quot; by which the self-sacrifice of Harry&apos;s mother protects the boy throughout the series, and which the power-hungry <a href="/wiki/Voldemort" class="mw-redirect" title="Voldemort">Voldemort</a> fails to understand.</p>
<p>In an 8 November 2002 <i><a href="/wiki/Slate_(magazine)" title="Slate (magazine)">Slate</a></i> article, Chris Suellentrop likened Potter to a &quot;trust-fund kid whose success at school is largely attributable to the gifts his friends and relatives lavish upon him&quot;. Noting that in Rowling&apos;s fiction, magical ability potential is &quot;something you are born to, not something you can achieve&quot;, Suellentrop wrote that Dumbledore&apos;s maxim that &quot;It is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities&quot; is hypocritical, as &quot;the school that Dumbledore runs values native gifts above all else&quot;. In a 12 August 2007 <i>New York Times</i> review of <i>Deathly Hallows</i>, however, <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens" title="Christopher Hitchens">Christopher Hitchens</a> praised Rowling for &quot;unmooring&quot; her &quot;English school story&quot; from literary precedents &quot;bound up with dreams of wealth and class and snobbery&quot;, arguing that she had instead created &quot;a world of youthful democracy and diversity&quot;.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Controversies">Controversies</span></h3>

<p>The books have been the subject of a number of <a href="/wiki/Lawsuit" title="Lawsuit">legal proceedings</a>, stemming from various conflicts over copyright and trademark infringements. The popularity and high <a href="/wiki/Market_value" title="Market value">market value</a> of the series has led Rowling, her publishers, and film distributor <a href="/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> to take legal measures to protect their copyright, which have included banning the sale of <i>Harry Potter</i> imitations, targeting the owners of websites over the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; <a href="/wiki/Domain_name" title="Domain name">domain name</a>, and suing author <a href="/wiki/Nancy_Stouffer" class="mw-redirect" title="Nancy Stouffer">Nancy Stouffer</a> to counter her accusations that Rowling had plagiarised her work. Various religious conservatives have claimed that the books promote witchcraft and religions such as <a href="/wiki/Wicca" title="Wicca">Wicca</a> and are therefore unsuitable for children, while a number of critics have criticised the books for promoting various political agendas.</p>
<p>The books also aroused controversies in the literary and publishing worlds. In 1997 to 1998, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone" title="Harry Potter and the Philosopher&apos;s Stone">Harry Potter and the Philosopher&apos;s Stone</a></i> won almost all the UK awards judged by children, but none of the children&apos;s book awards judged by adults, and Sandra Beckett suggested the reason was <a href="/wiki/Intellectual_snobbery" class="mw-redirect" title="Intellectual snobbery">intellectual snobbery</a> towards books that were popular among children. In 1999, the winner of the <a href="/wiki/Whitbread_Book_Award" class="mw-redirect" title="Whitbread Book Award">Whitbread Book of the Year award</a> children&apos;s division was entered for the first time on the shortlist for the main award, and one judge threatened to resign if <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></i> was declared the overall winner; it finished second, very close behind the winner of the poetry prize, <a href="/wiki/Seamus_Heaney" title="Seamus Heaney">Seamus Heaney</a>&apos;s translation of the <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Saxon" class="mw-redirect" title="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> <a href="/wiki/Epic_poetry" title="Epic poetry">epic</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Beowulf" title="Beowulf">Beowulf</a></i>.</p>
<p>In 2000, shortly before the publication of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire" title="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a></i>, the previous three <i>Harry Potter</i> books topped the <i>New York Times</i> fiction best-seller list and a third of the entries were children&apos;s books. The newspaper created a new children&apos;s section covering children&apos;s books, including both fiction and non-fiction, and initially counting only hardback sales. The move was supported by publishers and booksellers. In 2004, <i>The New York Times</i> further split the children&apos;s list, which was still dominated by <i>Harry Potter</i> books into sections for series and individual books, and removed the <i>Harry Potter</i> books from the section for individual books. The split in 2000 attracted condemnation, praise and some comments that presented both benefits and disadvantages of the move. <i>Time</i> suggested that, on the same principle, Billboard should have created a separate &quot;<a href="/wiki/Mop-top" class="mw-redirect" title="Mop-top">mop-tops</a>&quot; list in 1964 when the <a href="/wiki/Beatles" class="mw-redirect" title="Beatles">Beatles</a> held the top five places in its list, and <a href="/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research" title="Nielsen Media Research">Nielsen</a> should have created a separate game-show list when <i><a href="/wiki/Who_Wants_to_Be_a_Millionaire%3F" title="Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</a></i> dominated the <a href="/wiki/Nielsen_ratings" title="Nielsen ratings">ratings</a>.</p>

<p>In 1998, Rowling sold the film rights of the first four <i>Harry Potter</i> books to <a href="/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> for a reported &#xA3;1&#xA0;million ($1,982,900). Rowling demanded the principal cast be kept strictly British, nonetheless allowing for the inclusion of Irish actors such as the late <a href="/wiki/Richard_Harris_(actor)" class="mw-redirect" title="Richard Harris (actor)">Richard Harris</a> as Dumbledore, and for casting of French and Eastern European actors in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire" title="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a></i> where characters from the book are specified as such. After many directors including <a href="/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>, <a href="/wiki/Terry_Gilliam#Gilliam_and_Harry_Potter" title="Terry Gilliam">Terry Gilliam</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Demme" title="Jonathan Demme">Jonathan Demme</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Alan_Parker" title="Alan Parker">Alan Parker</a> were considered, <a href="/wiki/Chris_Columbus_(filmmaker)" title="Chris Columbus (filmmaker)">Chris Columbus</a> was appointed on 28 March 2000 as director for <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Philosopher&apos;s Stone (film)">Harry Potter and the Philosopher&apos;s Stone</a></i> (titled &quot;<i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&apos;s Stone</i>&quot; in the United States), with Warner Bros. citing his work on other family films such as <i><a href="/wiki/Home_Alone" title="Home Alone">Home Alone</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Mrs._Doubtfire" title="Mrs. Doubtfire">Mrs. Doubtfire</a></i> and proven experience with directing children as influences for their decision.</p>
<p>After <a href="/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_films_cast_members" class="mw-redirect" title="List of Harry Potter films cast members">extensive casting</a>, filming began in October 2000 at <a href="/wiki/Leavesden_Film_Studios" class="mw-redirect" title="Leavesden Film Studios">Leavesden Film Studios</a> and in London itself, with production ending in July 2001. <i>Philosopher&apos;s Stone</i> was released on 14 November 2001.

<p>In March 2008, Warner Bros. President and COO <a href="/wiki/Alan_F._Horn" title="Alan F. Horn">Alan F. Horn</a> announced that the final instalment in the series, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></i>, would be released in two cinematic parts: <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_%E2%80%93_Part_1" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows &#x2013; Part 1">Part 1</a></i> on 19 November 2010 and <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_%E2%80%93_Part_2" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows &#x2013; Part 2">Part 2</a></i> on 15 July 2011. <a href="/wiki/Production_of_Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows" title="Production of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">Production of both parts</a> started in February 2009, with the final day of principal photography taking place on 12 June 2010.</p>
<p>Rowling had creative control on the film series, observing the filmmaking process of <i>Philosopher&apos;s Stone</i> and serving as producer on the two-part <i>Deathly Hallows</i>, alongside <a href="/wiki/David_Heyman" title="David Heyman">David Heyman</a> and <a href="/wiki/David_Barron_(film_producer)" title="David Barron (film producer)">David Barron</a>. The <i>Harry Potter</i> films have been top-rank box office hits, with all eight releases on the <a href="/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films" title="List of highest-grossing films">list of highest-grossing films worldwide</a>. <i>Philosopher&apos;s Stone</i> was the highest-grossing <i>Harry Potter</i> film up until the release of the final instalment of the series, <i>Deathly Hallows</i>, while <i>Prisoner of Azkaban</i> grossed the least. As well as being a financial success, the film series has also been a success among film critics.</p>
<p>Opinions of the films are generally divided among fans, with one group preferring the more faithful approach of the first two films, and another group preferring the more stylised character-driven approach of the later films. Rowling has been constantly supportive of all the films and evaluated <i>Deathly Hallows</i> as her &quot;favourite one&quot; in the series. She wrote on her website of the changes in the book-to-film transition, &quot;It is simply impossible to incorporate every one of my storylines into a film that has to be kept under four hours long. Obviously films have restrictions novels do not have, constraints of time and budget; I can create dazzling effects relying on nothing but the interaction of my own and my readers&apos; imaginations&quot;.</p>
<p>At the <a href="/wiki/64th_British_Academy_Film_Awards" title="64th British Academy Film Awards">64th British Academy Film Awards</a> in February 2011, Rowling was joined by producers David Heyman and David Barron along with directors David Yates, Alfonso Cuar&#xF3;n and Mike Newell in collecting the <a href="/wiki/64th_British_Academy_Film_Awards#Michael_Balcon_Award_for_Outstanding_British_Contribution_to_Cinema" title="64th British Academy Film Awards">Michael Balcon Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema</a> on behalf of all the films in the series.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Spin-off_prequels">Spin-off prequels</span></h4>
<p>A new trilogy of films, beginning with <i><a href="/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them_(film)" title="Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</a></i>, will take place before the main series. The films will be released in November 2016, 2018 and 2020 respectively. Rowling wrote the screenplay for the first instalment, marking her first foray into screenwriting.</p>
