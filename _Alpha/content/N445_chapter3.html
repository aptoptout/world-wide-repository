<p><b>HTTPS</b> (also called <b>HTTP over <a href="/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</a></b>, <b>HTTP over SSL</b>, and <b>HTTP Secure</b>) is a <a href="/wiki/Communications_protocol" title="Communications protocol">protocol</a> for <a href="/wiki/Network_security" title="Network security">secure</a> communication over a <a href="/wiki/Computer_network" title="Computer network">computer network</a> which is widely used on the <a href="/wiki/Internet" title="Internet">Internet</a>. HTTPS consists of communication over <a href="/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">Hypertext Transfer Protocol</a> (HTTP) within a connection encrypted by <a href="/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" title="Transport Layer Security">Transport Layer Security or its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer</a>. The main motivation for HTTPS is <a href="/wiki/Authentication" title="Authentication">authentication</a> of the visited <a href="/wiki/Website" title="Website">website</a> and protection of the <a href="/wiki/Information_privacy" title="Information privacy">privacy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Data_integrity" title="Data integrity">integrity</a> of the exchanged data.</p>
<p>In its popular deployment on the internet, HTTPS provides authentication of the website and associated <a href="/wiki/Web_server" title="Web server">web server</a> with which one is communicating, which protects against <a href="/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack" title="Man-in-the-middle attack">man-in-the-middle attacks</a>. Additionally, it provides bidirectional <a href="/wiki/Encryption" title="Encryption">encryption</a> of communications between a client and server, which protects against <a href="/wiki/Eavesdropping" title="Eavesdropping">eavesdropping</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tamper-evident#Tampering" class="mw-redirect" title="Tamper-evident">tampering</a> with or forging the contents of the communication. In practice, this provides a reasonable guarantee that one is communicating with precisely the website that one intended to communicate with (as opposed to an impostor), as well as ensuring that the contents of communications between the user and site cannot be read or forged by any third party.</p>
<p>Historically, HTTPS connections were primarily used for payment transactions on the <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Web" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a>, e-mail and for sensitive transactions in corporate information systems. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, HTTPS began to see widespread use for protecting page authenticity on all types of websites, securing accounts and keeping user communications, identity and <a href="/wiki/Web_browsing" class="mw-redirect" title="Web browsing">web browsing</a> private.</p>

<p>The <i>HTTPS</i> <a href="/wiki/Uniform_resource_identifier" class="mw-redirect" title="Uniform resource identifier">uniform resource identifier</a> (URI) scheme has identical syntax to the standard HTTP scheme, aside from its scheme token. However, HTTPS signals the browser to use an added encryption layer of SSL/TLS to protect the traffic. SSL/TLS is especially suited for HTTP since it can provide some protection even if only one side of the communication is <a href="/wiki/Authentication" title="Authentication">authenticated</a>. This is the case with HTTP transactions over the Internet, where typically only the <a href="/wiki/Webserver" class="mw-redirect" title="Webserver">server</a> is authenticated (by the client examining the server&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Public_key_certificate" title="Public key certificate">certificate</a>).</p>
<p>HTTPS creates a secure channel over an insecure network. This ensures reasonable protection from <a href="/wiki/Eavesdropping" title="Eavesdropping">eavesdroppers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack" title="Man-in-the-middle attack">man-in-the-middle attacks</a>, provided that adequate <a href="/wiki/Cipher_suite" title="Cipher suite">cipher suites</a> are used and that the server certificate is verified and trusted.</p>
<p>Because HTTPS piggybacks HTTP entirely on top of TLS, the entirety of the underlying HTTP protocol can be encrypted. This includes the request URL (which particular web page was requested), query parameters, headers, and cookies (which often contain identity information about the user). However, because host (website) addresses and port numbers are necessarily part of the underlying <a href="/wiki/TCP/IP" class="mw-redirect" title="TCP/IP">TCP/IP</a> protocols, HTTPS cannot protect their disclosure. In practice this means that even on a correctly configured web server, eavesdroppers can infer the IP address and port number of the web server (sometimes even the domain name e.g. www.example.org, but not the rest of the URL) that one is communicating with as well as the amount (data transferred) and duration (length of session) of the communication, though not the content of the communication.</p>
<p>Web browsers know how to trust HTTPS websites based on <a href="/wiki/Certificate_authorities" class="mw-redirect" title="Certificate authorities">certificate authorities</a> that come pre-installed in their software. Certificate authorities (such as <a href="/wiki/Symantec" title="Symantec">Symantec</a>, <a href="/wiki/Comodo_Group" title="Comodo Group">Comodo</a>, <a href="/wiki/GoDaddy" title="GoDaddy">GoDaddy</a> and <a href="/wiki/GlobalSign" title="GlobalSign">GlobalSign</a>) are in this way being trusted by web browser creators to provide valid certificates. Therefore, a user should trust an HTTPS connection to a website <a href="/wiki/If_and_only_if" title="If and only if">if and only if</a> all of the following are true:</p>

<p>HTTPS is especially important over insecure networks (such as public WiFi access points), as anyone on the same local network can <a href="/wiki/Packet_analyzer" title="Packet analyzer">packet sniff</a> and discover sensitive information not protected by HTTPS. Additionally, many free to use and even paid for WLAN networks engage in <a href="/wiki/Packet_injection" title="Packet injection">packet injection</a> in order to serve their own ads on webpages. However, this can be exploited maliciously in many ways, such as injecting malware onto webpages and stealing users&apos; private information.</p>
<p>HTTPS is also very important for connections over the <a href="/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)" title="Tor (anonymity network)">Tor anonymity network</a>, as malicious Tor nodes can damage or alter the contents passing through them in an insecure fashion and inject malware into the connection. This is one reason why the <a href="/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation" title="Electronic Frontier Foundation">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> and the Tor project started the development of <a href="/wiki/HTTPS_Everywhere" title="HTTPS Everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a>, which is included in the Tor Browser Bundle.</p>
<p>As more information is revealed about global <a href="/wiki/Mass_surveillance" title="Mass surveillance">mass surveillance</a> and criminals stealing personal information, the use of HTTPS security on all websites is becoming increasingly important regardless of the type of Internet connection being used. While <a href="/wiki/Metadata" title="Metadata">metadata</a> about individual pages that a user visits is not sensitive, when combined together, they can reveal a lot about the user and compromise the user&apos;s privacy.</p>
<p>Deploying HTTPS also allows the use of <a href="/wiki/SPDY" title="SPDY">SPDY</a>/<a href="/wiki/HTTP/2" title="HTTP/2">HTTP/2</a>, that are new generations of HTTP, designed to reduce page load times and latency.</p>
<p>It is recommended to use <a href="/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security" title="HTTP Strict Transport Security">HTTP Strict Transport Security</a> (HSTS) with HTTPS to protect users from man-in-the-middle attacks, especially <a href="/wiki/Moxie_Marlinspike#SSL_stripping" title="Moxie Marlinspike">SSL stripping</a>.</p>
<p>HTTPS should not be confused with the little-used <a href="/wiki/Secure_Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" title="Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol">Secure HTTP</a> (S-HTTP) specified in <a class="external mw-magiclink-rfc" rel="nofollow" href="//tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2660">RFC 2660</a>.</p>

<p>Firefox uses HTTPS for Google searches as of version 14, to &quot;shield our users from network infrastructure that may be gathering data about the users or modifying/censoring their search results&quot;.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation" title="Electronic Frontier Foundation">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, opining that &quot;In an ideal world, every web request could be defaulted to HTTPS&quot;, has provided an add-on called <a href="/wiki/HTTPS_Everywhere" title="HTTPS Everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a> for <a href="/wiki/Mozilla_Firefox" class="mw-redirect" title="Mozilla Firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a> that enables HTTPS by default for hundreds of frequently used websites. A beta version of this plugin is also available for <a href="/wiki/Google_Chrome" title="Google Chrome">Google Chrome</a> and Chromium.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Security">Security</span></h2>

<p>The security of HTTPS is that of the underlying TLS, which typically uses long-term public and private keys to generate a short term session key which is then used to encrypt the data flow between client and server. <a href="/wiki/X.509" title="X.509">X.509</a> certificates are used to authenticate the server (and sometimes the client as well). As a consequence, <a href="/wiki/Certificate_authority" title="Certificate authority">certificate authorities</a> and <a href="/wiki/Public_key_certificate" title="Public key certificate">public key certificates</a> are necessary to verify the relation between the certificate and its owner, as well as to generate, sign, and administer the validity of certificates. While this can be more beneficial than verifying the identities via a <a href="/wiki/Web_of_trust" title="Web of trust">web of trust</a>, the <a href="/wiki/2013_mass_surveillance_disclosures" class="mw-redirect" title="2013 mass surveillance disclosures">2013 mass surveillance disclosures</a> drew attention to certificate authorities as a potential weak point allowing <a href="/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack" title="Man-in-the-middle attack">man-in-the-middle attacks</a>. An important property in this context is <a href="/wiki/Forward_secrecy" title="Forward secrecy">forward secrecy</a>, which ensures that encrypted communications recorded in the past cannot be retrieved and decrypted should long-term secret keys or passwords be compromised in the future. Not all web servers provide forward secrecy.</p>
<p>A site must be completely hosted over HTTPS, without having part of its contents loaded over HTTP - for example, having scripts loaded insecurely - or the user will be vulnerable to some attacks and surveillance. Also having only a certain page that contains sensitive information (such as a log-in page) of a website loaded over HTTPS, while having the rest of the website loaded over plain HTTP, will expose the user to attacks. On a site that has sensitive information somewhere on it, every time that site is accessed with HTTP instead of HTTPS, the user and the session will get exposed. Similarly, <a href="/wiki/HTTP_cookie" title="HTTP cookie">cookies</a> on a site served through HTTPS have to have the <a href="/wiki/Secure_cookie" class="mw-redirect" title="Secure cookie">secure attribute</a> enabled.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Technical">Technical</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Difference_from_HTTP">Difference from HTTP</span></h3>
<p>HTTPS URLs begin with &quot;https://&quot; and use <a href="/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers" title="List of TCP and UDP port numbers">port</a> 443 by default, whereas <a href="/wiki/HTTP" class="mw-redirect" title="HTTP">HTTP</a> <a href="/wiki/URL" class="mw-redirect" title="URL">URLs</a> begin with &quot;http://&quot; and use <a href="/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers" title="List of TCP and UDP port numbers">port</a> 80 by default.</p>
<p>HTTP is not encrypted and is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle and eavesdropping attacks, which can let attackers gain access to website accounts and sensitive information, and modify webpages to inject <a href="/wiki/Malware" title="Malware">malware</a> or advertisements. HTTPS is designed to withstand such attacks and is considered secure against them (with the exception of older, deprecated versions of SSL).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Network_layers">Network layers</span></h3>
<p>HTTP operates at the highest layer of the <a href="/wiki/TCP/IP_model" class="mw-redirect" title="TCP/IP model">TCP/IP model</a>, the Application layer; as does the TLS security protocol (operating as a lower sublayer of the same layer), which encrypts an HTTP message prior to transmission and decrypts a message upon arrival. Strictly speaking, HTTPS is not a separate protocol, but refers to use of ordinary <a href="/wiki/HTTP" class="mw-redirect" title="HTTP">HTTP</a> over an <a href="/wiki/Encryption" title="Encryption">encrypted</a> SSL/TLS connection.</p>
<p>Everything in the HTTPS message is encrypted, including the headers, and the request/response load. With the exception of the possible <a href="/wiki/Chosen-ciphertext_attack" title="Chosen-ciphertext attack">CCA</a> cryptographic attack described in the <a href="#Limitations">limitations</a> section below, the attacker can only know that a connection is taking place between the two parties and their domain names and IP addresses.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Server_setup">Server setup</span></h3>
<p>To prepare a web server to accept HTTPS connections, the administrator must create a <a href="/wiki/Public_key_certificate" title="Public key certificate">public key certificate</a> for the web server. This certificate must be signed by a trusted <a href="/wiki/Certificate_authority" title="Certificate authority">certificate authority</a> for the web browser to accept it without warning. The authority certifies that the certificate holder is the operator of the web server that presents it. Web browsers are generally distributed with a list of <a href="/wiki/Root_certificate" title="Root certificate">signing certificates of major certificate authorities</a> so that they can verify certificates signed by them.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Acquiring_certificates">Acquiring certificates</span></h4>
<p>Authoritatively signed certificates may be free or cost between <span class="nowrap">8 <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" title="United States dollar">USD</a></span> and <span class="nowrap">70 USD</span> per year (in 2012&#x2013;2014).</p>
<p>Organizations may also run their own certificate authority, particularly if they are responsible for setting up browsers to access their own sites (for example, sites on a company <a href="/wiki/Intranet" title="Intranet">intranet</a>, or major universities). They can easily add copies of their own signing certificate to the trusted certificates distributed with the browser.</p>
<p>There also exists a peer-to-peer certificate authority, <a href="/wiki/CACert" class="mw-redirect" title="CACert">CACert</a>. However, it is not included in the trusted root certificates of many popular browsers (e.g. Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer), which may cause warning messages to be displayed to end users.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Let%27s_Encrypt" title="Let&apos;s Encrypt">Let&apos;s Encrypt</a>, launched in April 2016, provides free and automated SSL/TLS certificates to websites. According to the <a href="/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation" title="Electronic Frontier Foundation">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, &quot;Let&apos;s Encrypt&quot; will make switching from HTTP to HTTPS &quot;as easy as issuing one command, or clicking one button.&quot;</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Use_as_access_control">Use as access control</span></h4>
<p>The system can also be used for client <a href="/wiki/Authentication" title="Authentication">authentication</a> in order to limit access to a web server to authorized users. To do this, the site administrator typically creates a certificate for each user, a certificate that is loaded into their browser. Normally, that contains the name and e-mail address of the authorized user and is automatically checked by the server on each reconnect to verify the user&apos;s identity, potentially without even entering a password.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="In_case_of_compromised_secret_.28private.29_key">In case of compromised secret (private) key</span></h4>
<p>An important property in this context is <a href="/wiki/Perfect_forward_secrecy" class="mw-redirect" title="Perfect forward secrecy">perfect forward secrecy</a> (PFS). Possessing one of the long-term asymmetric secret keys used to establish an HTTPS session should not make it easier to derive the short-term session key to then decrypt the conversation, even at a later time. <a href="/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange" title="Diffie&#x2013;Hellman key exchange">Diffie&#x2013;Hellman key exchange</a> (DHE) and <a href="/wiki/Elliptic_curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman" title="Elliptic curve Diffie&#x2013;Hellman">Elliptic curve Diffie&#x2013;Hellman</a> key exchange (ECDHE) are in 2013 the only ones known to have that property. Only 30% of Firefox, Opera, and Chromium Browser sessions use it, and nearly 0% of Apple&apos;s Safari and Microsoft Internet Explorer sessions. Among the larger internet providers, only Google supports PFS since 2011 (State of September 2013).</p>
<p>A certificate may be revoked before it expires, for example because the secrecy of the private key has been compromised. Newer versions of popular browsers such as <a href="/wiki/Firefox" title="Firefox">Firefox</a>, <a href="/wiki/Opera_(web_browser)" title="Opera (web browser)">Opera</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Internet_Explorer" title="Internet Explorer">Internet Explorer</a> on <a href="/wiki/Windows_Vista" title="Windows Vista">Windows Vista</a> implement the <a href="/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol" title="Online Certificate Status Protocol">Online Certificate Status Protocol</a> (OCSP) to verify that this is not the case. The browser sends the certificate&apos;s serial number to the certificate authority or its delegate via OCSP and the authority responds, telling the browser whether or not the certificate is still valid.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Limitations">Limitations</span></h3>
<p>SSL/TLS comes in two options, simple and mutual. The mutual version is more secure, but requires the user to install a personal <a href="/wiki/Client_certificate" title="Client certificate">client certificate</a> into their web browser in order to authenticate themselves.</p>
<p>Whatever strategy is used (simple or mutual), the level of protection strongly depends on the correctness of the <a href="/wiki/Implementation" title="Implementation">implementation</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Web_browser" title="Web browser">web browser</a> and the server software and the actual <a href="/wiki/Cipher" title="Cipher">cryptographic algorithms</a> supported.</p>
<p>SSL/TLS does not prevent the entire site from being indexed using a <a href="/wiki/Web_crawler" title="Web crawler">web crawler</a>, and in some cases the <a href="/wiki/Uniform_resource_identifier" class="mw-redirect" title="Uniform resource identifier">URI</a> of the encrypted resource can be inferred by knowing only the intercepted request/response size. This allows an attacker to have access to the <a href="/wiki/Plaintext" title="Plaintext">plaintext</a> (the publicly available static content), and the <a href="/wiki/Ciphertext" title="Ciphertext">encrypted text</a> (the encrypted version of the static content), permitting a <a href="/wiki/Chosen-ciphertext_attack" title="Chosen-ciphertext attack">cryptographic attack</a>.</p>
<p>Because <a href="/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</a> operates below HTTP and has no knowledge of higher-level protocols, TLS servers can only strictly present one certificate for a particular IP/port combination. This means that, in most cases, it is not feasible to use <a href="/wiki/Virtual_hosting#Name-based" title="Virtual hosting">name-based virtual hosting</a> with HTTPS. A solution called <a href="/wiki/Server_Name_Indication" title="Server Name Indication">Server Name Indication</a> (SNI) exists, which sends the hostname to the server before encrypting the connection, although many older browsers do not support this extension. Support for SNI is available since <a href="/wiki/Firefox" title="Firefox">Firefox</a> 2, <a href="/wiki/Opera_(web_browser)" title="Opera (web browser)">Opera</a> 8, Safari 2.1, Google Chrome 6, and <a href="/wiki/Internet_Explorer_7" title="Internet Explorer 7">Internet Explorer 7</a> on <a href="/wiki/Windows_Vista" title="Windows Vista">Windows Vista</a>.</p>
<p>From an architectural point of view:</p>
<ol>
<li>An SSL/TLS connection is managed by the first front machine that initiates the TLS connection. If, for any reasons (routing, traffic optimization, etc.), this front machine is not the application server and it has to decipher data, solutions have to be found to propagate user authentication information or certificate to the application server, which needs to know who is going to be connected.</li>
<li>For SSL/TLS with mutual authentication, the SSL/TLS session is managed by the first server that initiates the connection. In situations where encryption has to be propagated along chained servers, session timeOut management becomes extremely tricky to implement.</li>
<li>With mutual SSL/TLS, security is maximal, but on the client-side, there is no way to properly end the SSL/TLS connection and disconnect the user except by waiting for the server session to expire or closing all related client applications.</li>
</ol>
<p>A sophisticated type of <a href="/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack" title="Man-in-the-middle attack">man-in-the-middle attack</a> called SSL stripping was presented at the Blackhat Conference 2009. This type of attack defeats the security provided by HTTPS by changing the <tt>https:</tt> link into an <tt>http:</tt> link, taking advantage of the fact that few Internet users actually type &quot;https&quot; into their browser interface: they get to a secure site by clicking on a link, and thus are fooled into thinking that they are using HTTPS when in fact they are using HTTP. The attacker then communicates in clear with the client. This prompted the development of a countermeasure in HTTP called <a href="/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security" title="HTTP Strict Transport Security">HTTP Strict Transport Security</a>.</p>
<p>HTTPS has been shown vulnerable to a range of <a href="/wiki/Traffic_analysis" title="Traffic analysis">traffic analysis</a> attacks. Traffic analysis attacks are a type of <a href="/wiki/Side-channel_attack" title="Side-channel attack">side-channel attack</a> that relies on variations in the timing and size of traffic in order to infer properties about the encrypted traffic itself. Traffic analysis is possible because SSL/TLS encryption changes the contents of traffic, but has minimal impact on the size and timing of traffic. In May 2010, a research paper by researchers from <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Research" title="Microsoft Research">Microsoft Research</a> and <a href="/wiki/Indiana_University_Bloomington" title="Indiana University Bloomington">Indiana University</a> discovered that detailed sensitive user data can be inferred from side channels such as packet sizes. More specifically, the researchers found that an eavesdropper can infer the illnesses/medications/surgeries of the user, his/her family income and investment secrets, despite HTTPS protection in several high-profile, top-of-the-line web applications in healthcare, taxation, investment and web search. Although this work demonstrated vulnerability of HTTPS to traffic analysis, the approach presented by the authors required manual analysis and focused specifically on web applications protected by HTTPS.</p>
<p>In June 2014, a team of researchers at <a href="/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley" title="University of California, Berkeley">UC Berkeley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Intel" title="Intel">Intel</a> lead by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://bradmiller.io">Brad Miller</a> demonstrated a generalized approach to HTTPS traffic analysis based on <a href="/wiki/Machine_learning" title="Machine learning">machine learning</a>. The researchers demonstrated that the attack applied to a range of websites, including <a href="/wiki/Mayo_Clinic" title="Mayo Clinic">Mayo Clinic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Planned_Parenthood" title="Planned Parenthood">Planned Parenthood</a> and <a href="/wiki/Youtube" class="mw-redirect" title="Youtube">Youtube</a>. The attack assumes that the attacker is able to visit the same webpages as the victim to gather network traffic which serves as training data. The attacker is then able to identify similarities in the packet sizes and orderings between the victim traffic and the training data traffic which frequently allow the attacker to infer the exact page the victim is visiting. For example, this attack could be used to determine whether a user browsing the Planned Parenthood website is looking for information about preventative health screening or an abortion. Note that the attack can not be used to discover user specific values embedded in a webpage. For example, many banks offer web interfaces which allow users to view account balances. While the attacker would be able to discover that the user was viewing an account balance page, he would be unable to learn the users exact account balance or account number.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Netscape_Communications" class="mw-redirect" title="Netscape Communications">Netscape Communications</a> created HTTPS in 1994 for its <a href="/wiki/Netscape_Navigator" title="Netscape Navigator">Netscape Navigator</a> web browser. Originally, HTTPS was used with the <a href="/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer" class="mw-redirect" title="Secure Sockets Layer">SSL</a> protocol. As SSL evolved into <a href="/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" title="Transport Layer Security">Transport Layer Security</a> (TLS), the current version of HTTPS was formally specified by <a class="external mw-magiclink-rfc" rel="nofollow" href="//tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818">RFC 2818</a> in May 2000.</p>
