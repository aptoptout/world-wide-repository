<p>The human species&apos; use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The <a href="/wiki/Prehistory" title="Prehistory">prehistoric</a> discovery of <a href="/wiki/Control_of_fire_by_early_humans" title="Control of fire by early humans">how to control fire</a> and the later <a href="/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution" title="Neolithic Revolution">Neolithic Revolution</a> increased the available sources of food and the invention of the <a href="/wiki/Wheel" title="Wheel">wheel</a> helped humans to travel in and control their environment.

<p>Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced <a href="/wiki/Economy" title="Economy">economies</a> (including today&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Economic_globalization" title="Economic globalization">global economy</a>) and has allowed the rise of a <a href="/wiki/Conspicuous_leisure" title="Conspicuous leisure">leisure class</a>.

Various implementations of technology influence the <a href="/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)" class="mw-redirect" title="Value (personal and cultural)">values</a> of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of <a href="/wiki/Efficient_energy_use" title="Efficient energy use">efficiency</a> in terms of human <a href="/wiki/Productivity" title="Productivity">productivity</a>, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The use of the term &quot;technology&quot; has changed significantly over the last 200 years. Before the 20th century, the term was uncommon in English, and usually referred to the description or study of the <a href="/wiki/Useful_arts" class="mw-redirect" title="Useful arts">useful arts</a>. The term was often connected to technical education, as in the <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (chartered in 1861).</p>
<p>The term &quot;technology&quot; rose to prominence in the 20th century in connection with the <a href="/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution" title="Second Industrial Revolution">Second Industrial Revolution</a>. The term&apos;s meanings changed in the early 20th century when American social scientists, beginning with <a href="/wiki/Thorstein_Veblen" title="Thorstein Veblen">Thorstein Veblen</a>, translated ideas from the German concept of <i><a href="//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technik" class="extiw" title="de:Technik">Technik</a></i> into &quot;technology&quot;. In German and other European languages, a distinction exists between <i>technik</i> and <i>technologie</i> that is absent in English, which usually translates both terms as &quot;technology&quot;. By the 1930s, &quot;technology&quot; referred not only to the <i>study</i> of the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_arts" title="Industrial arts">industrial arts</a> but to the industrial arts themselves.</p>
<p>In 1937, the American sociologist Read Bain wrote that &quot;technology includes all tools, machines, utensils, weapons, instruments, housing, clothing, communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them.&quot; Bain&apos;s definition remains common among scholars today, especially social scientists. But equally prominent is the definition of technology as applied science, especially among scientists and engineers, although most social scientists who study technology reject this definition. More recently, scholars have borrowed from European philosophers of &quot;technique&quot; to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason, as in <a href="/wiki/Michel_Foucault" title="Michel Foucault">Foucault</a>&apos;s work on <a href="/wiki/Technologies_of_the_self" class="mw-redirect" title="Technologies of the self">technologies of the self</a> (<i>techniques de soi</i>).</p>
<p>Dictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions. The <i><a href="/wiki/Merriam-Webster" title="Merriam-Webster">Merriam-Webster</a> Dictionary</i> offers a definition of the term: &quot;the practical application of knowledge especially in a particular area&quot; and &quot;a capability given by the practical application of knowledge&quot;. <a href="/wiki/Ursula_Franklin" title="Ursula Franklin">Ursula Franklin</a>, in her 1989 &quot;Real World of Technology&quot; lecture, gave another definition of the concept; it is &quot;practice, the way we do things around here&quot;. The term is often used to imply a specific field of technology, or to refer to <a href="/wiki/High_technology" class="mw-redirect" title="High technology">high technology</a> or just <a href="/wiki/Consumer_electronics" title="Consumer electronics">consumer electronics</a>, rather than technology as a whole. <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Stiegler" title="Bernard Stiegler">Bernard Stiegler</a>, in <i><a href="/wiki/Technics_and_Time,_1" title="Technics and Time, 1">Technics and Time, 1</a></i>, defines technology in two ways: as &quot;the pursuit of life by means other than life&quot;, and as &quot;organized inorganic matter.&quot;</p>
<p>Technology can be most broadly defined as the entities, both material and immaterial, created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value. In this usage, technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real-world problems. It is a far-reaching term that may include simple tools, such as a <a href="/wiki/Crowbar_(tool)" title="Crowbar (tool)">crowbar</a> or wooden <a href="/wiki/Spoon" title="Spoon">spoon</a>, or more complex machines, such as a <a href="/wiki/Space_station" title="Space station">space station</a> or <a href="/wiki/Particle_accelerator" title="Particle accelerator">particle accelerator</a>. Tools and machines need not be material; <span id="Virtual_technology"></span>virtual technology, such as <a href="/wiki/Computer_software" class="mw-redirect" title="Computer software">computer software</a> and <a href="/wiki/Business_method" class="mw-redirect" title="Business method">business methods</a>, fall under this definition of technology. <a href="/wiki/W._Brian_Arthur" title="W. Brian Arthur">W. Brian Arthur</a> defines technology in a similarly broad way as &quot;a means to fulfill a human purpose&quot;.</p>
<p>The word &quot;technology&quot; can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques. In this context, it is the current state of humanity&apos;s knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products, to solve problems, fulfill needs, or satisfy wants; it includes technical methods, skills, processes, techniques, tools and raw materials. When combined with another term, such as &quot;medical technology&quot; or &quot;space technology&quot;, it refers to the state of the respective field&apos;s knowledge and tools. &quot;<a href="/wiki/State-of-the-art" class="mw-redirect" title="State-of-the-art">State-of-the-art</a> technology&quot; refers to the <a href="/wiki/High_technology" class="mw-redirect" title="High technology">high technology</a> available to humanity in any field.</p>

<p>Technology can be viewed as an activity that forms or changes culture. Additionally, technology is the application of math, science, and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known.

<p>The distinction between science, engineering and technology is not always clear. <a href="/wiki/Science" title="Science">Science</a> is the <a href="/wiki/Reasoned" class="mw-redirect" title="Reasoned">reasoned</a> investigation or study of natural phenomena, aimed at discovering enduring principles among elements of the <a href="/wiki/Phenomenal" class="mw-redirect" title="Phenomenal">phenomenal</a> world by employing <a href="/wiki/Formality" title="Formality">formal</a> techniques such as the <a href="/wiki/Scientific_method" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a>. Technologies are not usually exclusively products of science, because they have to satisfy requirements such as <a href="/wiki/Utility" title="Utility">utility</a>, <a href="/wiki/Usability" title="Usability">usability</a> and <a href="/wiki/Safety" title="Safety">safety</a>.</p>
<p>Engineering is the <a href="/wiki/Goal-oriented" class="mw-redirect" title="Goal-oriented">goal-oriented</a> process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means, often (but not always) using results and techniques from science. The development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge, including scientific, engineering, <a href="/wiki/Mathematics" title="Mathematics">mathematical</a>, <a href="/wiki/Language" title="Language">linguistic</a>, and <a href="/wiki/History" title="History">historical</a> knowledge, to achieve some practical result.</p>
<p>Technology is often a consequence of science and engineering&#xA0;&#x2014; although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields. For example, science might study the flow of <a href="/wiki/Electron" title="Electron">electrons</a> in <a href="/wiki/Electrical_conductor" title="Electrical conductor">electrical conductors</a>, by using already-existing tools and knowledge. This new-found knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines, such as <a href="/wiki/Semiconductor" title="Semiconductor">semiconductors</a>, <a href="/wiki/Computer" title="Computer">computers</a>, and other forms of advanced technology. In this sense, scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists; the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference.</p>
<p>The exact relations between science and technology in particular have been debated by scientists, historians, and policymakers in the late 20th century, in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science. In the immediate wake of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, for example, in the United States it was widely considered that technology was simply &quot;applied science&quot; and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time. An articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in <a href="/wiki/Vannevar_Bush" title="Vannevar Bush">Vannevar Bush</a>&apos;s treatise on postwar science policy, <i>Science&#x2014;The Endless Frontier</i>: &quot;New products, new industries, and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature&#xA0;... This essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research.&quot; In the late-1960s, however, this view came under direct attack, leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks (initiatives resisted by the scientific community). The issue remains contentious&#x2014;though most analysts resist the model that technology simply is a result of scientific research.</p>

<p>The discovery and utilization of fire, a simple <a href="/wiki/Energy" title="Energy">energy</a> source with many profound uses, was a turning point in the technological evolution of humankind. The exact date of its discovery is not known; evidence of burnt animal bones at the <a href="/wiki/Cradle_of_Humankind" title="Cradle of Humankind">Cradle of Humankind</a> suggests that the domestication of fire occurred before 1,000,000&#xA0;BC; scholarly consensus indicates that <i><a href="/wiki/Homo_erectus" title="Homo erectus">Homo erectus</a></i> had controlled fire by between 500,000&#xA0;BC and 400,000&#xA0;BC. Fire, fueled with <a href="/wiki/Wood" title="Wood">wood</a> and <a href="/wiki/Charcoal" title="Charcoal">charcoal</a>, allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility, improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten.</p>

<p>Other technological advances made during the Paleolithic era were <a href="/wiki/Clothing" title="Clothing">clothing</a> and shelter; the adoption of both technologies cannot be dated exactly, but they were a key to humanity&apos;s progress. As the Paleolithic era progressed, dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate; as early as 380,000&#xA0;BC, humans were constructing temporary wood huts. Clothing, adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals, helped humanity expand into colder regions; humans began to <a href="/wiki/Historical_migration" class="mw-redirect" title="Historical migration">migrate</a> out of Africa by 200,000&#xA0;BC and into other continents, such as <a href="/wiki/Eurasia" title="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>.</p>

An array of Neolithic artifacts, including bracelets, axe heads, chisels, and polishing tools</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Man&apos;s technological ascent began in earnest in what is known as the <a href="/wiki/Neolithic" title="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> period (&quot;New stone age&quot;). The invention of polished <a href="/wiki/Stone_axe" class="mw-redirect" title="Stone axe">stone axes</a> was a major advance that allowed <a href="/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">forest clearance</a> on a large scale to create farms. <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">Agriculture</a> fed larger populations, and the transition to <a href="/wiki/Sedentism" title="Sedentism">sedentism</a> allowed simultaneously raising more children, as infants no longer needed to be carried, as <a href="/wiki/Nomad" title="Nomad">nomadic</a> ones must. Additionally, children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could to the <a href="/wiki/Hunter-gatherer" title="Hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a> economy.</p>
<p>With this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in <a href="/wiki/Labor_specialization" class="mw-redirect" title="Labor specialization">labor specialization</a>. What triggered the progression from early Neolithic villages to the first cities, such as <a href="/wiki/Uruk" title="Uruk">Uruk</a>, and the first civilizations, such as <a href="/wiki/Sumer" title="Sumer">Sumer</a>, is not specifically known; however, the emergence of increasingly <a href="/wiki/Hierarchy" title="Hierarchy">hierarchical</a> social structures and specialized labor, of trade and war amongst adjacent cultures, and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as <a href="/wiki/Irrigation" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a>, are all thought to have played a role.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Metal_tools">Metal tools</span></h4>
<p>Continuing improvements led to the <a href="/wiki/Furnace" title="Furnace">furnace</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bellows" title="Bellows">bellows</a> and provided the ability to <a href="/wiki/Smelting" title="Smelting">smelt</a> and <a href="/wiki/Forge" title="Forge">forge</a> native metals (naturally occurring in relatively pure form). <a href="/wiki/Gold" title="Gold">Gold</a>, <a href="/wiki/Copper" title="Copper">copper</a>, <a href="/wiki/Silver" title="Silver">silver</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Lead" title="Lead">lead</a>, were such early metals. The advantages of copper tools over stone, bone, and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans, and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of <a href="/wiki/Neolithic" title="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> times (about 8000 BC). Native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts, but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires. Eventually, the working of metals led to the discovery of <a href="/wiki/Alloys" class="mw-redirect" title="Alloys">alloys</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Bronze" title="Bronze">bronze</a> and <a href="/wiki/Brass" title="Brass">brass</a> (about 4000 BC).

The <a href="/wiki/Wheel" title="Wheel">wheel</a> was invented circa 4000 BC.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile, humans were learning to harness other forms of energy. The earliest known use of wind power is the sailboat. The earliest record of a ship under sail is shown on an Egyptian pot dating back to 3200 BC. From prehistoric times, Egyptians probably used the power of the annual <a href="/wiki/Flooding_of_the_Nile" title="Flooding of the Nile">flooding of the Nile</a> to irrigate their lands, gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely built irrigation channels and &apos;catch&apos; basins. Similarly, the early peoples of Mesopotamia, the Sumerians, learned to use the Tigris and Euphrates rivers for much the same purposes. But more extensive use of wind and water (and even human) power required another invention.</p>
<p>According to archaeologists, the <a href="/wiki/Wheel" title="Wheel">wheel</a> was invented around 4000 B.C. probably independently and nearly simultaneously in Mesopotamia (in present-day <a href="/wiki/Iraq" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>), the Northern Caucasus (<a href="/wiki/Maykop_culture" title="Maykop culture">Maykop culture</a>) and Central Europe. Estimates on when this may have occurred range from 5500 to 3000 B.C., with most experts putting it closer to 4000 B.C. The oldest artifacts with drawings that depict wheeled carts date from about 3000 B.C.; however, the wheel may have been in use for millennia before these drawings were made. There is also evidence from the same period for the use of the <a href="/wiki/Potter%27s_wheel" title="Potter&apos;s wheel">potter&apos;s wheel</a>. More recently, the oldest-known wooden wheel in the world was found in the Ljubljana marshes of Slovenia.</p>
<p>The invention of the wheel revolutionized trade and war. It did not take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads. Fast (rotary) potters&apos; wheels enabled early <a href="/wiki/Mass_production" title="Mass production">mass production</a> of pottery. But it was the use of the wheel as a transformer of energy (through <a href="/wiki/Water_wheel" title="Water wheel">water wheels</a>, windmills, and even treadmills) that revolutionized the application of nonhuman power sources.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Technicism">Technicism</span></h3>
<p>Generally, <a href="/wiki/Technicism" title="Technicism">technicism</a> is a reliance or confidence in technology as a benefactor of society. Taken to extreme, technicism is the belief that humanity will ultimately be able to control the entirety of existence using technology. In other words, human beings will someday be able to master all problems and possibly even control the future using technology. Some, such as <a href="/w/index.php?title=Stephen_V._Monsma&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Stephen V. Monsma (page does not exist)">Stephen V.

<p>On the somewhat skeptical side are certain philosophers like <a href="/wiki/Herbert_Marcuse" title="Herbert Marcuse">Herbert Marcuse</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Zerzan" title="John Zerzan">John Zerzan</a>, who believe that technological societies are inherently flawed. They suggest that the inevitable result of such a society is to become evermore technological at the cost of freedom and psychological health.</p>
<p>Many, such as the <a href="/wiki/Luddites" class="mw-redirect" title="Luddites">Luddites</a> and prominent philosopher <a href="/wiki/Martin_Heidegger" title="Martin Heidegger">Martin Heidegger</a>, hold serious, although not entirely deterministic reservations, about technology (see &quot;<a href="/wiki/The_Question_Concerning_Technology" title="The Question Concerning Technology">The Question Concerning Technology</a>&quot;). According to Heidegger scholars <a href="/wiki/Hubert_Dreyfus" title="Hubert Dreyfus">Hubert Dreyfus</a> and Charles Spinosa, &quot;Heidegger does not oppose technology. He hopes to reveal the essence of technology in a way that &apos;in no way confines us to a stultified compulsion to push on blindly with technology or, what comes to the same thing, to rebel helplessly against it.&apos; Indeed, he promises that &apos;when we once open ourselves expressly to the essence of technology, we find ourselves unexpectedly taken into a freeing claim.&apos;&quot; What this entails is a more complex relationship to technology than either techno-optimists or techno-pessimists tend to allow.</p>
<p>Some of the most poignant criticisms of technology are found in what are now considered to be dystopian literary classics, for example <a href="/wiki/Aldous_Huxley" title="Aldous Huxley">Aldous Huxley</a>&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/Brave_New_World" title="Brave New World">Brave New World</a></i> and other writings, <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Burgess" title="Anthony Burgess">Anthony Burgess</a>&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/A_Clockwork_Orange" title="A Clockwork Orange">A Clockwork Orange</a></i>, and <a href="/wiki/George_Orwell" title="George Orwell">George Orwell</a>&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four" title="Nineteen Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a></i>. And, in <i><a href="/wiki/Faust" title="Faust">Faust</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Goethe" class="mw-redirect" title="Goethe">Goethe</a>, Faust&apos;s selling his soul to the devil in return for power over the physical world, is also often interpreted as a metaphor for the adoption of industrial technology. More recently, modern works of science fiction, such as those by <a href="/wiki/Philip_K._Dick" title="Philip K. Dick">Philip K. Dick</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_Gibson" title="William Gibson">William Gibson</a>, and films (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Blade_Runner" title="Blade Runner">Blade Runner</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell" title="Ghost in the Shell">Ghost in the Shell</a>) project highly ambivalent or cautionary attitudes toward technology&apos;s impact on human society and identity.</p>
<p>The late cultural critic <a href="/wiki/Neil_Postman" title="Neil Postman">Neil Postman</a> distinguished tool-using societies from technological societies and, finally, what he called &quot;technopolies,&quot; that is, societies that are dominated by the ideology of technological and scientific progress, to the exclusion or harm of other cultural practices, values and world-views.</p>
<p>Darin Barney has written about technology&apos;s impact on practices of <a href="/wiki/Citizenship" title="Citizenship">citizenship</a> and democratic culture, suggesting that technology can be construed as (1) an object of political debate, (2) a means or medium of discussion, and (3) a setting for democratic deliberation and citizenship. As a setting for democratic culture, Barney suggests that technology tends to make <a href="/wiki/Ethics" title="Ethics">ethical</a> questions, including the question of what a good life consists in, nearly impossible, because they already give an answer to the question: a good life is one that includes the use of more and more technology.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Nikolas_Kompridis" title="Nikolas Kompridis">Nikolas Kompridis</a> has also <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia08/parrhesia08_kompridis.pdf">written</a> about the dangers of new technology, such as <a href="/wiki/Genetic_engineering" title="Genetic engineering">genetic engineering</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nanotechnology" title="Nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Synthetic_biology" title="Synthetic biology">synthetic biology</a> and <a href="/wiki/Robotics" title="Robotics">robotics</a>. He warns that these technologies introduce unprecedented new challenges to human beings, including the possibility of the permanent alteration of our biological nature. These concerns are shared by other philosophers, scientists and public intellectuals who have written about similar issues (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Francis_Fukuyama" title="Francis Fukuyama">Francis Fukuyama</a>, <a href="/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas" title="J&#xFC;rgen Habermas">J&#xFC;rgen Habermas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bill_Joy" title="Bill Joy">William Joy</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Michael_Sandel" class="mw-redirect" title="Michael Sandel">Michael Sandel</a>).</p>
<p>Another prominent critic of technology is <a href="/wiki/Hubert_Dreyfus" title="Hubert Dreyfus">Hubert Dreyfus</a>, who has published books <i>On the Internet</i> and <i>What Computers Still Can&apos;t Do</i>.</p>

His thesis appears to be a third way between Optimism and Skepticism. Basically, he stands for a neutral approach of the linkage between technology and American issues concerning <a href="/wiki/Unemployment" title="Unemployment">unemployment</a> and eroding wages.</p>
<p>He uses two main arguments to defend his point. First of all, because of recent technological advances, an increasing number of workers are losing their jobs. Yet, scientific evidence fails to clearly demonstrate that technology has displaced so many workers that it has created more problems than it has solved. Indeed, <a href="/wiki/Automation" title="Automation">automation</a> threatens repetitive jobs but higher-end jobs are still necessary because they complement technology and manual jobs that &quot;requires flexibility judgment and common sense&quot; remain hard to be replaced by <a href="/wiki/Machine" title="Machine">machines</a>.Second, studies have not defined clear links between recent technology advances and the wage trends of the last decades.</p>
<p>Therefore, according to <a href="/wiki/Jared_Bernstein" title="Jared Bernstein">Jared Bernstein</a>, instead of focusing on technology and its hypothetical influences on current American increasing unemployment and eroding wages, one needs to worry more about &quot;bad policy that fails to offset the imbalances in demand, trade, income and opportunity.&quot;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Complex_Technological_Systems">Complex Technological Systems</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Thomas_P._Hughes" title="Thomas P. Hughes">Thomas P. Hughes</a> pointed out that because technology has been considered as a key way to solve problems, we need to be aware of its complex and varied characters to use it more efficiently. What is the difference between a <a href="/wiki/Wheel" title="Wheel">wheel</a> or a <a href="/wiki/Compass" title="Compass">compass</a> and cooking machines such as an <a href="/wiki/Oven" title="Oven">oven</a> or a <a href="/wiki/Gas_stove" title="Gas stove">gas stove</a>? Can we consider all of them, only a part of them or none of them as technologies?</p>
<p>Technology is often considered too narrowly: according to <a href="/wiki/Thomas_P._Hughes" title="Thomas P. Hughes">Thomas P. Hughes</a> &quot;Technology is a creative process involving human ingenuity&#x201D;. This definition emphasizing on creativity avoids unbounded definition that may mistakenly include cooking &#x201C;technologies&#x201D;. But it also highlights the prominent role of humans and therefore their responsibilities for the use of complex technological systems.</p>
<p>Yet, because technology is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies, Hughes argued that <a href="/wiki/Engineer" title="Engineer">engineers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Scientist" title="Scientist">scientists</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Management" title="Management">managers</a> often have believed that they can use technology to shape the world as they want. They have often supposed that technology is easily controllable and this assumption has to be thoroughly questioned. For instance, <a href="/wiki/Evgeny_Morozov" title="Evgeny Morozov">Evgeny Morozov</a> particularly challenges two concepts: &#x201C;Internet-centrism&#x201D; and &#x201C;solutionism&#x201D;. Internet-centrism refers to the idea that our society is convinced that the Internet is one of the most stable and coherent forces. Solutionism is the ideology that every social issue can be solved thanks to technology and especially thanks to the internet. In fact, technology intrinsically contains uncertainties and limitations. According to <a href="/wiki/Alexis_Madrigal" title="Alexis Madrigal">Alexis Madrigal</a>&apos;s critique of Morozov&apos;s theory, to ignore it will lead to &#x201C;unexpected consequences that could eventually cause more damage than the problems they seek to address&#x201D;. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://es.lafayette.edu/people/benjamin-r-cohen/">Benjamin Cohen</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.drexel.edu/histpol/contact/facultyDirectory/GwenOttinger/">Gwen Ottinger</a> precisely discussed the multivalent effects of technology.</p>
<p>Therefore, recognition of the limitations of technology and more broadly scientific knowledge is needed &#x2014; especially in cases dealing with <a href="/wiki/Environmental_justice" title="Environmental justice">environmental justice</a> and health issues. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.drexel.edu/histpol/contact/facultyDirectory/GwenOttinger/">Gwen Ottinger</a> continues this reasoning and argues that the ongoing recognition of the limitations of scientific knowledge goes hand in hand with scientists and engineers&#x2019; new comprehension of their role. Such an approach of technology and science &quot;[require] technical professionals to conceive of their roles in the process differently. [They have to consider themselves as] collaborators in research and problem solving rather than simply providers of information and technical solutions&quot;.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Competitiveness">Competitiveness</span></h2>
<p>Technology is properly defined as any application of science to accomplish a function. The science can be leading edge or well established and the function can have high visibility or be significantly more mundane but it is all technology, and its exploitation is the foundation of all competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Technology-based planning is what was used to build the US industrial giants before WWII (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Dow_Chemical_Company" title="Dow Chemical Company">Dow</a>, <a href="/wiki/DuPont" title="DuPont">DuPont</a>, <a href="/wiki/General_Motors" title="General Motors">GM</a>) and it what was used to transform the US into a <a href="/wiki/Superpower" title="Superpower">superpower</a>. It was not economic-based planning.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Project_Socrates">Project Socrates</span></h3>

<p>In 1983 <a href="/wiki/Project_Socrates" title="Project Socrates">Project Socrates</a> was initiated in the <a href="/wiki/US_intelligence_community" class="mw-redirect" title="US intelligence community">US intelligence community</a> to determine the source of declining US economic and military competitiveness. Project Socrates concluded that technology exploitation is the foundation of all <a href="/wiki/Competitive_advantage" title="Competitive advantage">competitive advantage</a> and that declining US competitiveness was from decision-making in the private and public sectors switching from technology exploitation (technology-based planning) to money exploitation (economic-based planning) at the end of World War II.</p>
<p>Project Socrates determined that to rebuild US competitiveness, decision making throughout the US had to readopt technology-based planning. Project Socrates also determined that countries like China and India had continued executing technology-based (while the US took its detour into economic-based) planning, and as a result had considerably advanced the process and were using it to build themselves into superpowers. To rebuild US competitiveness the US decision-makers needed to adopt a form of technology-based planning that was far more advanced than that used by China and India.</p>
<p>Project Socrates determined that technology-based planning makes an evolutionary leap forward every few hundred years and the next evolutionary leap, the Automated Innovation Revolution, was poised to occur. In the Automated Innovation Revolution the process for determining how to acquire and utilize technology for a competitive advantage (which includes R&amp;D) is automated so that it can be executed with unprecedented speed, efficiency and agility.</p>
<p>Project Socrates developed the means for automated innovation so that the US could lead the Automated Innovation Revolution in order to rebuild and maintain the country&apos;s economic competitiveness for many generations.</p>

<p>The use of basic technology is also a feature of other animal species apart from humans. These include primates such as <a href="/wiki/Chimpanzee" title="Chimpanzee">chimpanzees</a>, some <a href="/wiki/Dolphin" title="Dolphin">dolphin</a> communities, and <a href="/wiki/Crow" title="Crow">crows</a>. Considering a more generic perspective of technology as ethology of active environmental conditioning and control, we can also refer to animal examples such as beavers and their dams, or bees and their honeycombs.</p>
<p>The ability to make and use tools was once considered a defining characteristic of the genus <a href="/wiki/Homo_(genus)" class="mw-redirect" title="Homo (genus)">Homo</a>. However, the discovery of tool construction among chimpanzees and related primates has discarded the notion of the use of technology as unique to humans. For example, researchers have observed wild chimpanzees utilising tools for foraging: some of the tools used include leaf sponges, termite fishing probes, <a href="/wiki/Pestle" class="mw-redirect" title="Pestle">pestles</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lever" title="Lever">levers</a>. <a href="/wiki/West_African_chimpanzee" class="mw-redirect" title="West African chimpanzee">West African chimpanzees</a> also use stone hammers and anvils for cracking nuts, as do <a href="/wiki/Capuchin_monkey" title="Capuchin monkey">capuchin monkeys</a> of <a href="/wiki/Boa_Vista,_Roraima" title="Boa Vista, Roraima">Boa Vista</a>, Brazil.</p>
