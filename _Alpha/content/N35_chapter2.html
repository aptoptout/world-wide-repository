<p>Kanye Omari West was born on June 8, 1977 in <a href="/wiki/Atlanta" title="Atlanta">Atlanta, Georgia</a>. His parents divorced when he was three years old. After the divorce, he and his mother moved to <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago, Illinois</a>. His father, Ray West, is a former <a href="/wiki/Black_Panther_Party" title="Black Panther Party">Black Panther</a> and was one of the first black photojournalists at <i><a href="/wiki/The_Atlanta_Journal-Constitution" title="The Atlanta Journal-Constitution">The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a></i>. Ray West was later a Christian counselor, and in 2006, opened the Good Water Store and Caf&#xE9; in <a href="/wiki/Lexington_Park,_Maryland" title="Lexington Park, Maryland">Lexington Park, Maryland</a> with startup capital from his son. West&apos;s mother, Dr. Donda C. (Williams) West, was a professor of English at <a href="/wiki/Clark_Atlanta_University" title="Clark Atlanta University">Clark Atlanta University</a>, and the Chair of the English Department at <a href="/wiki/Chicago_State_University" title="Chicago State University">Chicago State University</a> before retiring to serve as his manager. West was raised in a middle-class background, attending Polaris High School in suburban <a href="/wiki/Oak_Lawn,_Illinois" title="Oak Lawn, Illinois">Oak Lawn, Illinois</a> after living in Chicago.</p>
<p>At the age of 10, West moved with his mother to <a href="/wiki/Nanjing" title="Nanjing">Nanjing</a>, China, where she was teaching at <a href="/wiki/Nanjing_University" title="Nanjing University">Nanjing University</a> as part of an exchange program. According to his mother, West was the only foreigner in his class, but settled in well and quickly picked up the language, although he has since forgotten most of it. When asked about his grades in high school, West replied, &quot;I got A&apos;s and B&apos;s. And I&apos;m not even frontin&apos;.&quot;</p>
<p>West demonstrated an affinity for the arts at an early age; he began writing poetry when he was five years old. His mother recalled that she first took notice of West&apos;s passion for drawing and music when he was in the third grade. Growing up in Chicago, West became deeply involved in its hip hop scene. He started rapping in the third grade and began making musical compositions in the seventh grade, eventually selling them to other artists. At age thirteen, West wrote a rap song called &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; and began to persuade his mother to pay $25 an hour for time in a recording studio. It was a small, crude basement studio where a microphone hung from the ceiling by a wire clothes hanger. Although this wasn&apos;t what West&apos;s mother wanted, she nonetheless supported him. West crossed paths with producer/DJ <a href="/wiki/No_I.D." title="No I.D.">No I.D.</a>, with whom he quickly formed a close friendship. No I.D. soon became West&apos;s mentor, and it was from him that West learned how to sample and program beats after he received his first <a href="/wiki/Sampler_(musical_instrument)" title="Sampler (musical instrument)">sampler</a> at age 15.</p>
<p>After graduating from high school, West received a <a href="/wiki/Scholarship" title="Scholarship">scholarship</a> to attend Chicago&apos;s <a href="/wiki/American_Academy_of_Art" title="American Academy of Art">American Academy of Art</a> in 1997 and began taking painting classes, but shortly after transferred to <a href="/wiki/Chicago_State_University" title="Chicago State University">Chicago State University</a> to study English. He soon realized that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his musical work, and at 20 he dropped out of college to pursue his musical dreams. This action greatly displeased his mother, who was also a professor at the university. She later commented, &quot;It was drummed into my head that college is the ticket to a good life... but some career goals don&apos;t require college. For Kanye to make an album called <i>College Dropout</i> it was more about having the guts to embrace who you are, rather than following the path society has carved out for you.&quot;</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1996.E2.80.932002:_Early_work_and_Roc-A-Fella_Records">1996&#x2013;2002: Early work and Roc-A-Fella Records</span></h3>
<p>Kanye West began his early production career in the mid-1990s, making beats primarily for burgeoning local artists, eventually developing a style that involved speeding up vocal samples from classic <a href="/wiki/Soul_music" title="Soul music">soul</a> records. His first official production credits came at the age of nineteen when he produced eight tracks on <i>Down to Earth</i>, the 1996 debut album of a Chicago rapper named Grav. For a time, West acted as a ghost producer for <a href="/wiki/D-Dot" title="D-Dot">Deric &quot;D-Dot&quot; Angelettie</a>. Because of his association with D-Dot, West wasn&apos;t able to release a solo album, so he formed and became a member and producer of the Go-Getters, a late-1990s Chicago rap group composed of him, <a href="/wiki/GLC_(rapper)" title="GLC (rapper)">GLC</a>, Timmy G, <a href="/wiki/Really_Doe" title="Really Doe">Really Doe</a>, and Arrowstar. His group was managed by <a href="/wiki/John_Monopoly" title="John Monopoly">John &quot;Monopoly&quot; Johnson</a>, Don Crowley, and Happy Lewis under the management firm Hustle Period. After attending a series of promotional <a href="/wiki/Photo_shoot" title="Photo shoot">photo shoots</a> and making some radio appearances, The Go-Getters released their first and only studio album <i>World Record Holders</i> in 1999. The album featured other Chicago-based rappers such as <a href="/wiki/Rhymefest" title="Rhymefest">Rhymefest</a>, Mikkey Halsted, Miss Criss, and Shayla G. Meanwhile, the production was handled by West, Arrowstar, Boogz, and Brian &quot;All Day&quot; Miller.</p>
<p>West spent much of the late-1990s producing records for a number of well-known artists and music groups. The third song on <a href="/wiki/Foxy_Brown_(rapper)" title="Foxy Brown (rapper)">Foxy Brown</a>&apos;s second studio album <i><a href="/wiki/Chyna_Doll_(album)" title="Chyna Doll (album)">Chyna Doll</a></i> was produced by West. Her second effort subsequently became the very first hip-hop album by a female rapper to debut at the top of the U.S. <a href="/wiki/Billboard_200" title="Billboard 200"><i>Billboard</i> 200</a> chart in its first week of release. West produced three of the tracks on <a href="/wiki/Harlem_World_(group)" title="Harlem World (group)">Harlem World</a>&apos;s first and only album <i><a href="/wiki/The_Movement_(Harlem_World_album)" title="The Movement (Harlem World album)">The Movement</a></i> alongside <a href="/wiki/Jermaine_Dupri" title="Jermaine Dupri">Jermaine Dupri</a> and the production duo <a href="/wiki/Trackmasters" title="Trackmasters">Trackmasters</a>. His songs featured rappers <a href="/wiki/Nas" title="Nas">Nas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Drag-On" title="Drag-On">Drag-On</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Contemporary_R%26B" title="Contemporary R&amp;B">R&amp;B</a> singer <a href="/wiki/Carl_Thomas_(singer)" title="Carl Thomas (singer)">Carl Thomas</a>. The ninth track from <i><a href="/wiki/World_Party_(album)" title="World Party (album)">World Party</a></i>, the last <a href="/wiki/Goodie_Mob" title="Goodie Mob">Goodie Mob</a> album to feature the rap group&apos;s four founding members prior to their break-up, was co-produced by West with his manager Deric &quot;D-Dot&quot; Angelettie. At the close of the millennium, West ended up producing six songs for <i><a href="/wiki/Tell_%27Em_Why_U_Madd" title="Tell &apos;Em Why U Madd">Tell &apos;Em Why U Madd</a></i>, an album that was released by D-Dot under the alias of The Madd Rapper; a fictional character he created for a <a href="/wiki/Hip_hop_skit" title="Hip hop skit">skit</a> on <a href="/wiki/The_Notorious_B.I.G." title="The Notorious B.I.G.">The Notorious B.I.G.</a>&apos;s second and final studio album <i><a href="/wiki/Life_After_Death" title="Life After Death">Life After Death</a></i>.

<div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/File:Jay-Z_Kanye_Watch_the_Throne_Staples_Center_9_(cropped).jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>
West received early acclaim for his production work on <a href="/wiki/Jay-Z" class="mw-redirect" title="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a>&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Blueprint" title="The Blueprint">The Blueprint</a></i>; the two are pictured here in 2011.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>West got his big break in the year 2000, when he began to produce for artists on <a href="/wiki/Roc-A-Fella_Records" title="Roc-A-Fella Records">Roc-A-Fella Records</a>. West came to achieve recognition and is often credited with revitalizing Jay-Z&apos;s career with his contributions to the rap mogul&apos;s influential 2001 album <i><a href="/wiki/The_Blueprint" title="The Blueprint">The Blueprint</a></i>. <i>The Blueprint</i> is consistently ranked among the greatest hip-hop albums, and the critical and financial success of the album generated substantial interest in West as a producer. Serving as an in-house producer for Roc-A-Fella Records, West produced records for other artists from the label, including <a href="/wiki/Beanie_Sigel" title="Beanie Sigel">Beanie Sigel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Freeway_(rapper)" title="Freeway (rapper)">Freeway</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Cam%27ron" title="Cam&apos;ron">Cam&apos;ron</a>. He also crafted hit songs for <a href="/wiki/Ludacris" title="Ludacris">Ludacris</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alicia_Keys" title="Alicia Keys">Alicia Keys</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Janet_Jackson" title="Janet Jackson">Janet Jackson</a>.</p>
<p>Despite his success as a producer, West&apos;s true aspiration was to be a rapper. Though he had developed his rapping long before he began producing, it was often a challenge for West to be accepted as a rapper, and he struggled to attain a record deal. Multiple record companies ignored him because he did not portray the &apos;gangsta image&apos; prominent in mainstream hip hop at the time. After a series of meetings with <a href="/wiki/Capitol_Records" title="Capitol Records">Capitol Records</a>, West was ultimately denied an artist deal.</p>
<p>According to Capitol Record&apos;s A&amp;R, Joe Weinberger, he was approached by West and almost signed a deal with him, but another person in the company convinced Capitol&apos;s president not to. Desperate to keep West from defecting to another label, then-label head <a href="/wiki/Damon_Dash" title="Damon Dash">Damon Dash</a> reluctantly signed West to Roc-A-Fella Records. Jay-Z later admitted that Roc-A-Fella was initially reluctant to support West as a rapper, claiming that many saw him as a producer first and foremost, and that his background contrasted with that of his labelmates.</p>
<p>West&apos;s breakthrough came a year later on October 23, 2002, when, while driving home from a <a href="/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> recording studio after working late, he fell asleep at the wheel and was involved in a near-fatal car crash. The crash left him with a shattered jaw, which had to be wired shut in reconstructive surgery. The accident inspired West; two weeks after being admitted to the hospital, he recorded a song at the <a href="/wiki/Record_Plant_Studios" class="mw-redirect" title="Record Plant Studios">Record Plant Studios</a> with his jaw still wired shut. The composition, &quot;<a href="/wiki/Through_The_Wire" class="mw-redirect" title="Through The Wire">Through The Wire</a>&quot;, expressed West&apos;s experience after the accident, and helped lay the foundation for his debut album, as according to West &quot;all the better artists have expressed what they were going through&quot;. West added that &quot;the album was my medicine&quot;, as working on the record distracted him from the pain. &quot;Through The Wire&quot; was first available on West&apos;s <i>Get Well Soon...</i> <a href="/wiki/Mixtape" title="Mixtape">mixtape</a>, released December 2002. At the same time, West announced that he was working on an album called <i>The College Dropout</i>, whose overall theme was to &quot;make your own decisions. Don&apos;t let society tell you, &apos;This is what you have to do.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>West delivers the goods with a disarming mix of confessional honesty and sarcastic humor, earnest idealism and big-pimping materialism. In a scene still dominated by authenticity battles and gangsta posturing, he&apos;s a middle-class, politically conscious, post-thug, bourgeois rapper &#x2014; and that&apos;s nothing to be ashamed of.</p>

<p>Carrying a <a href="/wiki/Louis_Vuitton" title="Louis Vuitton">Louis Vuitton</a> backpack filled with old disks and demos to the studio and back, West crafted much of his production for his debut album in less than fifteen minutes at a time. He recorded the remainder of the album in Los Angeles while recovering from the car accident. Once he had completed the album, it was leaked months before its release date. However, West decided to use the opportunity to review the album, and <i>The College Dropout</i> was significantly remixed, remastered, and revised before being released. As a result, certain tracks originally destined for the album were subsequently retracted, among them &quot;Keep the Receipt&quot; with <a href="/wiki/Ol%27_Dirty_Bastard" title="Ol&apos; Dirty Bastard">Ol&apos; Dirty Bastard</a> and &quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&quot; with Consequence. West meticulously refined the production, adding <a href="/wiki/String_section" title="String section">string arrangements</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gospel_choir" class="mw-redirect" title="Gospel choir">gospel choirs</a>, improved <a href="/wiki/Drum" title="Drum">drum</a> <a href="/wiki/Programming_(music)" title="Programming (music)">programming</a> and new verses. West&apos;s perfectionism led <i>The College Dropout</i> to have its release postponed three times from its initial date in August 2003.</p>
<p><i>The College Dropout</i> was eventually issued by Roc-A-Fella in February 2004, shooting to number two on the <a href="/wiki/Billboard_200" title="Billboard 200"><i>Billboard</i> 200</a> as his debut single, &quot;<a href="/wiki/Through_the_Wire" title="Through the Wire">Through the Wire</a>&quot; peaked at number fifteen on the <a href="/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100" title="Billboard Hot 100"><i>Billboard</i> Hot 100</a> chart for five weeks. &quot;<a href="/wiki/Slow_Jamz" title="Slow Jamz">Slow Jamz</a>&quot;, his second single featuring <a href="/wiki/Twista" title="Twista">Twista</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jamie_Foxx" title="Jamie Foxx">Jamie Foxx</a>, became an even bigger success: it became the three musicians&apos; first number one hit. <i>The College Dropout</i> received near-universal critical acclaim from contemporary music critics, was voted the top album of the year by two major music publications, and has consistently been ranked among the great hip-hop works and debut albums by artists. &quot;<a href="/wiki/Jesus_Walks" title="Jesus Walks">Jesus Walks</a>&quot;, the album&apos;s fourth single, perhaps exposed West to a wider audience; the song&apos;s subject matter concerns faith and <a href="/wiki/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>. The song nevertheless reached the top 20 of the <i>Billboard</i> pop charts, despite industry executives&apos; predictions that a song containing such blatant declarations of faith would never make it to radio. <i>The College Dropout</i> would eventually be certified <a href="/wiki/RIAA_certification" title="RIAA certification">triple platinum</a> in the US, and garnered West 10 Grammy nominations, including <a href="/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Album_of_the_Year" title="Grammy Award for Album of the Year">Album of the Year</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Rap_Album" title="Grammy Award for Best Rap Album">Best Rap Album</a> (which it received). During this period, West also founded <a href="/wiki/GOOD_Music" title="GOOD Music">GOOD Music</a>, a record label and management company that would go on to house affiliate artists and producers, such as <a href="/wiki/No_I.D." title="No I.D.">No I.D.</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Legend" title="John Legend">John Legend</a>. At the time, the focal point of West&apos;s production style was the use of sped-up vocal samples from <a href="/wiki/Soul_music" title="Soul music">soul</a> records. However, partly because of the acclaim of <i>The College Dropout</i>, such sampling had been much copied by others; with that overuse, and also because West felt he had become too dependent on the technique, he decided to find a new sound.</p>

<p>Beginning his second effort that fall, West would invest two million dollars and take over a year to craft his second album. West was significantly inspired by <i><a href="/wiki/Roseland_NYC_Live" title="Roseland NYC Live">Roseland NYC Live</a></i>, a 1998 live album by English <a href="/wiki/Trip_hop" title="Trip hop">trip hop</a> group <a href="/wiki/Portishead_(band)" title="Portishead (band)">Portishead</a>, produced with the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Philharmonic_Orchestra" class="mw-redirect" title="New York Philharmonic Orchestra">New York Philharmonic Orchestra</a>. Early in his career, the live album had inspired him to incorporate <a href="/wiki/String_arrangement" class="mw-redirect" title="String arrangement">string arrangements</a> into his hip-hop production. Though West had not been able to afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album, the money from his commercial success enabled him to hire a <a href="/wiki/String_orchestra" title="String orchestra">string orchestra</a> for his second album <i><a href="/wiki/Late_Registration" title="Late Registration">Late Registration</a></i>. West collaborated with American <a href="/wiki/Film_score" title="Film score">film score</a> composer <a href="/wiki/Jon_Brion" title="Jon Brion">Jon Brion</a>, who served as the album&apos;s co-executive producer for several tracks. Although Brion had no prior experience in creating hip-hop records, he and West found that they could productively work together after their first afternoon in the studio where they discovered that neither confined his musical knowledge and vision to one specific genre. <i>Late Registration</i> sold over 2.3&#xA0;million units in the United States alone by the end of 2005 and was considered by industry observers as the only successful major album release of the fall season, which had been plagued by steadily declining CD sales.</p>
<p>While West had encountered controversy a year prior when he stormed out of the <a href="/wiki/American_Music_Awards_of_2004" title="American Music Awards of 2004">American Music Awards of 2004</a> after losing Best New Artist, the rapper&apos;s first large-scale controversy came just days following <i>Late Registration</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">&apos;s</span> release, during a benefit concert for <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> victims. In September 2005, <a href="/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a> broadcast <a href="/wiki/A_Concert_for_Hurricane_Relief" title="A Concert for Hurricane Relief">A Concert for Hurricane Relief</a>, and West was a featured speaker. When West was presenting alongside actor <a href="/wiki/Mike_Myers" title="Mike Myers">Mike Myers</a>, he deviated from the prepared script. Myers spoke next and continued to read the script. Once it was West&apos;s turn to speak again, he said, &quot;<a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" title="George W. Bush">George Bush</a> doesn&apos;t care about black people.&quot; West&apos;s comment reached much of the United States, leading to mixed reactions; President Bush would later call it one of the most &quot;disgusting moments&quot; of his presidency. West raised further controversy in January 2006 when he posed on the cover of <i><a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone_(magazine)" class="mw-redirect" title="Rolling Stone (magazine)">Rolling Stone</a></i> wearing a crown of thorns.</p>

<p>Fresh off spending the previous year touring the world with <a href="/wiki/U2" title="U2">U2</a> on their <a href="/wiki/Vertigo_Tour" title="Vertigo Tour">Vertigo Tour</a>, West felt inspired to compose anthemic rap songs that could operate more efficiently in large arenas.

<p>West&apos;s third studio album, <i><a href="/wiki/Graduation_(album)" title="Graduation (album)">Graduation</a></i>, garnered major publicity when its release date pitted West in a sales competition against rapper <a href="/wiki/50_Cent" title="50 Cent">50 Cent</a>&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/Curtis_(50_Cent_album)" title="Curtis (50 Cent album)">Curtis</a></i>. Upon their September 2007 releases, <i>Graduation</i> outsold <i>Curtis</i> by a large margin, debuting at number one on the U.S. <a href="/wiki/Billboard_200" title="Billboard 200"><i>Billboard</i> 200</a> chart and selling 957,000 copies in its first week. <i>Graduation</i> once again continued the string of critical and commercial successes by West, and the album&apos;s lead single, &quot;<a href="/wiki/Stronger_(Kanye_West_song)" title="Stronger (Kanye West song)">Stronger</a>&quot;, garnered the rapper his third number-one hit. &quot;Stronger&quot;, which samples French house duo <a href="/wiki/Daft_Punk" title="Daft Punk">Daft Punk</a>, has been accredited to not only encouraging other hip-hop artists to incorporate <a href="/wiki/House_(music)" class="mw-redirect" title="House (music)">house</a> and <a href="/wiki/Electronica" title="Electronica">electronica</a> elements into their music, but also for playing a part in the revival of <a href="/wiki/Disco" title="Disco">disco</a> and <a href="/wiki/Electro_music" class="mw-redirect" title="Electro music">electro</a>-infused music in the late 2000s. Ben Detrick of <i><a href="/wiki/XXL_(magazine)" title="XXL (magazine)">XXL</a></i> cited the outcome of the sales competition between 50 Cent&apos;s <i>Curtis</i> and West&apos;s <i>Graduation</i> as being responsible for altering the direction of hip-hop and paving the way for new rappers who didn&apos;t follow the <a href="/wiki/Hardcore_hip_hop" title="Hardcore hip hop">hardcore</a>-<a href="/wiki/Gangsta_rap" title="Gangsta rap">gangster</a> mold, writing, &quot;If there was ever a <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/watershed" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:watershed">watershed</a> moment to indicate hip-hop&apos;s changing direction, it may have come when 50 Cent competed with Kanye in 2007 to see whose album would claim superior sales.&quot;</p>
<p>West&apos;s life took a different direction when his mother, Donda West, died of complications from cosmetic surgery involving <a href="/wiki/Abdominoplasty" title="Abdominoplasty">abdominoplasty</a> and breast reduction in November 2007. Months later, West and fianc&#xE9;e Alexis Phifer ended their engagement and their long-term intermittent relationship, which had begun in 2002. The events profoundly affected West, who set off for his 2008 <a href="/wiki/Glow_in_the_Dark_Tour" title="Glow in the Dark Tour">Glow in the Dark Tour</a> shortly thereafter. Purportedly because his emotions could not be conveyed through rapping, West decided to sing using the voice audio processor <a href="/wiki/Auto-Tune" title="Auto-Tune">Auto-Tune</a>, which would become a central part of his next effort. West had previously experimented with the technology on his debut album <i><a href="/wiki/The_College_Dropout" title="The College Dropout">The College Dropout</a></i> for the background vocals of &quot;<a href="/wiki/Jesus_Walks_(Kanye_West_song)" class="mw-redirect" title="Jesus Walks (Kanye West song)">Jesus Walks</a>&quot; and &quot;Never Let Me Down.&quot; Recorded mostly in <a href="/wiki/Honolulu,_Hawaii" class="mw-redirect" title="Honolulu, Hawaii">Honolulu, Hawaii</a> in three weeks, West announced his fourth album, <i><a href="/wiki/808s_%26_Heartbreak" title="808s &amp; Heartbreak">808s &amp; Heartbreak</a></i>, at the <a href="/wiki/2008_MTV_Video_Music_Awards" title="2008 MTV Video Music Awards">2008 MTV Video Music Awards</a>, where he performed its lead single, &quot;<a href="/wiki/Love_Lockdown" title="Love Lockdown">Love Lockdown</a>&quot;. Music audiences were taken aback by the uncharacteristic production style and the presence of Auto-Tune, which typified the pre-release response to the record.</p>

<p><i>808s &amp; Heartbreak</i>, which features extensive use of the eponymous <a href="/wiki/Roland_TR-808" title="Roland TR-808">Roland TR-808</a> drum machine and contains themes of love, loneliness, and heartache, was released by <a href="/wiki/Island_Def_Jam" class="mw-redirect" title="Island Def Jam">Island Def Jam</a> to capitalize on <a href="/wiki/Thanksgiving" title="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> weekend in November 2008. Reviews were positive, though slightly more mixed than his previous efforts. Despite this, the record&apos;s singles demonstrated outstanding chart performances. Upon its release, the lead single &quot;<a href="/wiki/Love_Lockdown" title="Love Lockdown">Love Lockdown</a>&quot; debuted at number three on the <a href="/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100" title="Billboard Hot 100"><i>Billboard</i> Hot 100</a> and became a &quot;Hot Shot Debut&quot;, while follow-up single &quot;<a href="/wiki/Heartless_(Kanye_West_song)" title="Heartless (Kanye West song)">Heartless</a>&quot; performed similarly and became his second consecutive &quot;Hot Shot Debut&quot; by debuting at number four on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. While it was criticized prior to release, <i>808s &amp; Heartbreak</i> had a significant effect on hip-hop music, encouraging other rappers to take more creative risks with their productions.</p>
<p>In 2012, <i><a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a></i> journalist Matthew Trammell asserted that the record was ahead of its time and wrote, &quot;Now that popular music has finally caught up to it, <i>808s &amp; Heartbreak</i> has revealed itself to be Kanye&apos;s most vulnerable work, and perhaps his most brilliant.&quot;</p>

During the ceremony, West crashed the stage and grabbed the microphone from winner <a href="/wiki/Taylor_Swift" title="Taylor Swift">Taylor Swift</a> in order to proclaim that, instead, <a href="/wiki/Beyonc%C3%A9" title="Beyonc&#xE9;">Beyonc&#xE9;</a>&apos;s video for &quot;<a href="/wiki/Single_Ladies_(Put_a_Ring_on_It)" title="Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)">Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)</a>&quot;, nominated for the same award, was &quot;one of the best videos of all time&quot;. He was subsequently withdrawn from the remainder of the show for his actions. West&apos;s tour with <a href="/wiki/Lady_Gaga" title="Lady Gaga">Lady Gaga</a> was cancelled in response to the controversy, and it was suggested that the incident was partially responsible for <i>808s &amp; Heartbreak</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">&apos;s</span> lack of nominations at the <a href="/wiki/52nd_Grammy_Awards" class="mw-redirect" title="52nd Grammy Awards">52nd Grammy Awards</a>.</p>

<p>[West is] the pop star for our morally implicated times; an instinctive consumer with a mouthful of diamonds and furtive bad conscience, a performer who lives the <a href="/wiki/American_dream" class="mw-redirect" title="American dream">American dream</a> to its fullest with a creeping sense of the spiritual void at its heart.

<p>Following the highly publicized incident, West took a brief break from music and threw himself into fashion, only to hole up in Hawaii for the next few months writing and recording his next album. Importing his favorite producers and artists to work on and inspire his recording, West kept engineers behind the boards 24 hours a day and slept only in increments. Noah Callahan-Bever, a writer for <i><a href="/wiki/Complex_(magazine)" title="Complex (magazine)">Complex</a></i>, was present during the sessions and described the &quot;communal&quot; atmosphere as thus: &quot;With the right songs and the right album, he can overcome any and all controversy, and we are here to contribute, challenge, and inspire.&quot; A variety of artists contributed to the project, including close friends Jay-Z, <a href="/wiki/Kid_Cudi" title="Kid Cudi">Kid Cudi</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pusha_T" title="Pusha T">Pusha T</a>, as well as off-the-wall collaborations, such as with <a href="/wiki/Justin_Vernon" title="Justin Vernon">Justin Vernon</a> of <a href="/wiki/Bon_Iver" title="Bon Iver">Bon Iver</a>.</p>

In stark contrast to his previous effort, which featured a minimalist sound, <i>Dark Fantasy</i> adopts a maximalist philosophy and deals with themes of celebrity and excess. The record included the international hit &quot;<a href="/wiki/All_of_the_Lights" title="All of the Lights">All of the Lights</a>&quot;, and <i>Billboard</i> hits &quot;<a href="/wiki/Power_(Kanye_West_song)" title="Power (Kanye West song)">Power</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="/wiki/Monster_(Kanye_West_song)" title="Monster (Kanye West song)">Monster</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a href="/wiki/Runaway_(Kanye_West_song)" title="Runaway (Kanye West song)">Runaway</a>&quot;, the latter of which accompanied a <a href="/wiki/Runaway_(2010_film)" title="Runaway (2010 film)">35-minute film of the same name</a>. During this time, West initiated the free music program <a href="/wiki/GOOD_Fridays" title="GOOD Fridays">GOOD Fridays</a> through his website, offering a free download of previously unreleased songs each Friday, a portion of which were included on the album. This promotion ran from August 20 - December 17, 2010. <i>Dark Fantasy</i> went on to go platinum in the United States, but its omission as a contender for <a href="/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Album_of_the_Year" title="Grammy Award for Album of the Year">Album of the Year</a> at the <a href="/wiki/54th_Grammy_Awards" class="mw-redirect" title="54th Grammy Awards">54th Grammy Awards</a> was viewed as a &quot;snub&quot; by several media outlets.</p>

<p>Sessions for West&apos;s sixth solo effort begin to take shape in early 2013 in his own personal loft&apos;s living room at a Paris hotel.

Initial promotion of his sixth album included worldwide video projections of the album&apos;s music and live television performances. <i><a href="/wiki/Yeezus" title="Yeezus">Yeezus</a></i>, West&apos;s sixth album, was released June 18, 2013 to rave reviews from critics.

<p>Having initially announced a new album entitled <i>So Help Me God</i> slated for a 2014 release, in March 2015 West announced that the album would instead be tentatively called <i>SWISH</i>.

The next month, West headlined at the <a href="/wiki/Glastonbury_Festival" title="Glastonbury Festival">Glastonbury Festival</a> in the UK, despite a petition signed by almost 135,000 people against his appearance. Toward the end of the set, West proclaimed himself: &quot;the greatest living rock star on the planet.&quot; Media outlets, including social media sites such as Twitter, were divided on his performance. <i><a href="/wiki/NME" title="NME">NME</a></i> stated, &quot;The decision to book West for the slot has proved controversial since its announcement, and the show itself appeared to polarise both Glastonbury goers and those who tuned in to watch on their TVs.&quot; The publication added that &quot;he&apos;s letting his music speak for and prove itself.&quot; <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> said that &quot;his set has a potent ferocity &#x2013; but there are gaps and stutters, and he cuts a strangely lone figure in front of the vast crowd.&quot; In December 2015, West released a song titled &quot;<a href="/wiki/Facts_(song)" class="mw-redirect" title="Facts (song)">Facts</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>West announced in January 2016 that <i>SWISH</i> would be released on February 11, and that month released new songs &quot;Real Friends&quot; and a snippet of &quot;No More Parties in L.A.&quot; with <a href="/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar" title="Kendrick Lamar">Kendrick Lamar</a>.

Although a statement by West around <i>Life of Pablo</i>&apos;s initial release indicated that the album would be a permanent exclusive to Tidal, the album was released through several other competing services starting in April.</p>

<p>West&apos;s musical career has been defined by frequent stylistic shifts, and has seen him develop and explore a variety of different musical approaches and genres.

Early in his career, West pioneered a style of production dubbed &quot;chipmunk soul&quot; which utilized <a href="/wiki/Pitch_(music)" title="Pitch (music)">pitched-up</a> vocal samples, usually from <a href="/wiki/Soul_music" title="Soul music">soul</a> and <a href="/wiki/R%26B" class="mw-redirect" title="R&amp;B">R&amp;B</a> songs, along with his own drums and instrumentation.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Middle_period">Middle period</span></h3>
<p>With his third album, <i><a href="/wiki/Graduation_(album)" title="Graduation (album)">Graduation</a></i> (2007), West moved away from the soulful sound of his previous releases and towards a more atmospheric, <a href="/wiki/Rock_music" title="Rock music">rock</a>-tinged, <a href="/wiki/Electronic_music" title="Electronic music">electronic</a>-influenced soundscape. Under the belief that <i>Late Registration</i> had been too indulgent and poorly arranged, he fashioned <i>Graduation</i> to contain less ornate production, made the album completely devoid of <a href="/wiki/Hip_hop_skit" title="Hip hop skit">skits</a>, and attempted to <a href="/wiki/Music_sequencer" title="Music sequencer">sequence</a> it as a tighter, more cohesive package.

<p>Conceived in the wake of several distressing personal events, West&apos;s fourth studio album, <i><a href="/wiki/808s_%26_Heartbreak" title="808s &amp; Heartbreak">808s &amp; Heartbreak</a></i> (2008), marked a radical departure from his previous releases, largely abandoning <a href="/wiki/Rap_music" class="mw-redirect" title="Rap music">rap</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hip_hop" title="Hip hop">hip hop</a> stylings in favor of a stark <a href="/wiki/Electropop" title="Electropop">electropop</a> sound composed utilizing the <a href="/wiki/Roland_TR-808" title="Roland TR-808">Roland TR-808</a> <a href="/wiki/Drum_machine" title="Drum machine">drum machine</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Auto-Tune" title="Auto-Tune">Auto-Tune</a> vocal processor, and <a href="/wiki/Software_synthesizer" title="Software synthesizer">virtual synthesis</a> technology. The album&apos;s music features austere production and elements such as droning synthesizers, dense drums, lengthy <a href="/wiki/String_instrument" title="String instrument">strings</a>, and somber piano, and drew comparisons to the work of 1980s <a href="/wiki/Post-punk" title="Post-punk">post-punk</a> and <a href="/wiki/New_wave" class="mw-redirect" title="New wave">new wave</a> groups; West would confess an affinity with artists such as <a href="/wiki/Joy_Division" title="Joy Division">Joy Division</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gary_Numan" title="Gary Numan">Gary Numan</a>, <a href="/wiki/TJ_Swan" class="mw-redirect" title="TJ Swan">TJ Swan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Boy_George" title="Boy George">Boy George</a>, and later described <i>808s</i> as &quot;the first black new wave album.&quot; Maintaining a &quot;<a href="/wiki/Minimalism" title="Minimalism">minimal</a> but functional&quot; approach towards the album&apos;s studio production, West explored the electronic feel produced by his explicitly Auto-Tuned vocals and manipulated the sounds created by the 808, modulating its <a href="/wiki/Pitch_(music)" title="Pitch (music)">pitch</a> to produce a distorted, electronic sound; he then sought to juxtapose mechanical sounds with the traditional sounds of <a href="/wiki/Taiko_drum" class="mw-redirect" title="Taiko drum">taiko drums</a> and <a href="/wiki/Choir_monk" title="Choir monk">choir monks</a>. <i><a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a></i> journalist Matthew Trammell asserted that the record was ahead of its time and wrote in a 2012 article, &quot;Now that popular music has finally caught up to it, <i>808s &amp; Heartbreak</i> has revealed itself to be Kanye&apos;s most vulnerable work, and perhaps his most brilliant.&quot;</p>
<p>West recorded his fifth album, <i><a href="/wiki/My_Beautiful_Dark_Twisted_Fantasy" title="My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</a></i> (2010), with a wide range of collaborators. It has been noted by writers for its <a href="/wiki/Maximalism" title="Maximalism">maximalist</a> aesthetic and its incorporation of elements from West&apos;s previous four albums. <i><a href="/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" title="Entertainment Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a></i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">&apos;</span>s Simon Vozick-Levinson noted that such elements &quot;all recur at various points&quot;, namely &quot;the luxurious <a href="/wiki/Soul_music" title="Soul music">soul</a> of 2004&apos;s <i>The College Dropout</i>, the symphonic pomp of <i>Late Registration</i>, the gloss of 2007&apos;s <i>Graduation</i>, and the emotionally exhausted <a href="/wiki/Electro_music" class="mw-redirect" title="Electro music">electro</a> of 2008&apos;s <i>808s &amp; Heartbreak</i>.&quot; <a href="/wiki/AllMusic" title="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>&apos;s Andy Kellman views it as the &quot;culmination&quot; of those albums, while noting that &quot;it does not merely draw characteristics from each one of them. The 13 tracks ... sometimes fuse them together simultaneously. Consequently, the sonic and emotional layers are often difficult to pry apart and enumerate&quot;. Kellman emphasized the track &quot;<a href="/wiki/All_of_the_Lights" title="All of the Lights">All of the Lights</a>&quot; as most representative of the album&apos;s &quot;contrasting elements and maniacal extravagance.&quot; Robert Christgau, writing for <i><a href="/wiki/MSN_Music" title="MSN Music">MSN Music</a></i>, commented that the music eschews the &quot;grace&quot; of <i>The College Dropout</i> and <i>Late Registration</i> for &quot;grandiosity&quot; and &quot;sonic luxuries.&quot;</p>

Music critic <a href="/wiki/Greg_Kot" title="Greg Kot">Greg Kot</a> described it as &quot;a hostile, abrasive and intentionally off-putting&quot; album that combines &quot;the worlds of&quot; 1980s <a href="/wiki/Acid_house" title="Acid house">acid-house</a> and contemporary <a href="/wiki/Drill_(music_genre)" title="Drill (music genre)">Chicago drill music</a>, 1990s <a href="/wiki/Industrial_music" title="Industrial music">industrial music</a>, and the &quot;<a href="/wiki/Experimental_hip_hop" title="Experimental hip hop">avant-rap</a>&quot; of <a href="/wiki/Saul_Williams" title="Saul Williams">Saul Williams</a>, <a href="/wiki/Death_Grips" title="Death Grips">Death Grips</a> and <a href="/wiki/Odd_Future" title="Odd Future">Odd Future</a>.

It also continues West&apos;s practice of eclectic samples: he employs a sample of Nina Simone&apos;s &quot;<a href="/wiki/Strange_Fruit" title="Strange Fruit">Strange Fruit</a>,&quot; an obscure <a href="/wiki/Hindi" title="Hindi">Hindi</a> sample on &quot;<a href="/wiki/I_Am_a_God" title="I Am a God">I Am a God</a>&quot;, and a sample of 1970s <a href="/wiki/Hungarian_rock" title="Hungarian rock">Hungarian rock</a> group <a href="/wiki/Omega_(band)" title="Omega (band)">Omega</a> on &quot;New Slaves&quot;. &quot;On Sight&quot; interpolates a melody from &quot;Sermon (He&apos;ll Give Us What We Really Need)&quot; by the Holy Name of Mary Choral Family. <i><a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a></i> called the album a &quot;brilliant, obsessive-compulsive career auto-correct&quot;.</p>
<p>Released in 2016 after several years of delays, West&apos;s seventh album <i><a href="/wiki/The_Life_of_Pablo" title="The Life of Pablo">The Life of Pablo</a></i> was noted for its &quot;raw, occasionally even intentionally messy, composition&quot; in distinction to West&apos;s previous albums. <i>Rolling Stone</i> wrote that &quot;this is a messy album that feels like it was made that way on purpose, after the laser-sharp intensity of <i>Yeezus</i>,&quot; stating that &quot;It&apos;s designed to sound like a work in progress.&quot; Carl Wilson of <i><a href="/wiki/Slate_(magazine)" title="Slate (magazine)">Slate</a></i> characterized the album as creating &quot;strange links between Kanye&apos;s many iterations&#x2014;<a href="/wiki/Soul_music" title="Soul music">soul</a>-sample enthusiast, heartbroken <a href="/wiki/Auto-Tune" title="Auto-Tune">Auto-Tune</a> crooner, hedonistic avant-pop composer, <a href="/wiki/Industrial_rap" class="mw-redirect" title="Industrial rap">industrial-rap</a> shit-talker,&quot; suggesting that &quot;the point is that in the context of all this sonic landscaping, in West&apos;s kamikaze, mood-swinging way, <i>Pablo</i> now seems undeniably (not half-assedly, as I&apos;d been about to conclude) like an album of struggle.&quot; He also noted the album&apos;s use of <a href="/wiki/Auto-tune" class="mw-redirect" title="Auto-tune">auto-tune</a>, <a href="/wiki/A_cappella" title="A cappella">a cappella</a>, as well as bass and percussion lines &quot;that are only the tail-end decay of some lost starting place, some vanished rhythmic Eden.&quot; West initially characterized the release as &quot;a gospel album.&quot; <a href="/wiki/Greg_Kot" title="Greg Kot">Greg Kot</a> of the <i><a href="/wiki/Chicago_Tribune" title="Chicago Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a></i> wrote in his review of <i>The Life of Pablo</i>, &quot;West&apos;s version of gospel touches on some of those sonic cues &#x2014; heavy organ, soaring choirs &#x2014; but seems more preoccupied with gospel text and the notion of redemption.&quot;</p>

<p>Early in his career, West made clear his interest in fashion and desire to work in the clothing design industry. In September 2005, West announced that he would release his Pastelle Clothing line in spring 2006, claiming &quot;Now that I have a Grammy under my belt and <i>Late Registration</i> is finished, I am ready to launch my clothing line next spring.&quot; The line was developed over the following four years &#x2013; with multiple pieces teased by West himself &#x2013; before the line was ultimately cancelled in 2009. In 2009, West collaborated with <a href="/wiki/Nike,_Inc." title="Nike, Inc.">Nike</a> to release his own shoe, the <a href="/wiki/Nike_Air_Yeezy" title="Nike Air Yeezy">Air Yeezys</a>, with a second version released in 2012. In January 2009, West introduced his first shoe line designed for <a href="/wiki/Louis_Vuitton" title="Louis Vuitton">Louis Vuitton</a> during Paris Fashion Week.

<p>On October 1, 2011, Kanye West premiered his women&apos;s fashion label, DW Kanye West at Paris Fashion Week. He received support from DSquared2 duo Dean and Dan Caten, Olivier Theyskens, Jeremy Scott, Azzedine Ala&#xEF;a, and the Olsen twins, who were also in attendance during his show. His debut fashion show received mixed-to-negative reviews, ranging from reserved observations by Style.com to excoriating commentary by <a href="/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal" title="The Wall Street Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a>, the <a href="/wiki/International_Herald_Tribune" class="mw-redirect" title="International Herald Tribune">International Herald Tribune</a>, Elleuk.com, <a href="/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph" title="The Daily Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>, <a href="/wiki/Harper%27s_Bazaar" title="Harper&apos;s Bazaar">Harper&apos;s Bazaar</a> and many others.

<p>On January 5, 2012, West announced his establishment of the creative content company <a href="/wiki/DONDA" title="DONDA">DONDA</a>, named after his late mother Donda West. In his announcement, West proclaimed that the company would &quot;pick up where <a href="/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="Steve Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> left off&quot;; DONDA would operate as &quot;a design company which will galvanize amazing thinkers in a creative space to bounce their dreams and ideas&quot; with the &quot;goal to make products and experiences that people want and can afford.&quot; West is notoriously secretive about the company&apos;s operations, maintaining neither an official website nor a social media presence. In stating DONDA&apos;s creative philosophy, West articulated the need to &quot;put creatives in a room together with like minds&quot; in order to &quot;simplify and aesthetically improve everything we see, taste, touch, and feel.&quot;. Contemporary critics have noted the consistent <a href="/wiki/Minimalism" title="Minimalism">minimalistic</a> aesthetic exhibited throughout DONDA creative projects.</p>
<p>On March 30, 2015, it was announced that West is a co-owner, with various other music artists, in the <a href="/wiki/Music_streaming" class="mw-redirect" title="Music streaming">music streaming</a> service <a href="/wiki/Tidal_(service)" title="Tidal (service)">Tidal</a>. The service specialises in <a href="/wiki/Lossless_compression" title="Lossless compression">lossless</a> audio and high definition music videos. <a href="/wiki/Jay_Z" title="Jay Z">Jay Z</a> acquired the parent company of Tidal, <a href="/wiki/Aspiro" title="Aspiro">Aspiro</a>, in the first quarter of 2015. Including Beyonc&#xE9; and Jay-Z, sixteen artist stakeholders (such as <a href="/wiki/Rihanna" title="Rihanna">Rihanna</a>, <a href="/wiki/Beyonc%C3%A9" title="Beyonc&#xE9;">Beyonc&#xE9;</a>, <a href="/wiki/Madonna_(entertainer)" title="Madonna (entertainer)">Madonna</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chris_Martin" title="Chris Martin">Chris Martin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nicki_Minaj" title="Nicki Minaj">Nicki Minaj</a> and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake. The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry, and to rival other streaming services such as <a href="/wiki/Spotify" title="Spotify">Spotify</a>, which have been criticised for their low payout of <a href="/wiki/Royalties#Music_royalties" class="mw-redirect" title="Royalties">royalties</a>. &quot;The challenge is to get everyone to respect music again, to recognize its value&quot;, stated Jay-Z on the release of Tidal.</p>
<p>On June 6, 2016, West announced the Yeezy Season 2 Zine and the Adidas Yeezy Boost 750 will be released to retailers on June 11. They are <a href="/wiki/High-top" title="High-top">high-top</a> shoes with a glow in the dark sole.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Philanthropy">Philanthropy</span></h3>
<p>West, alongside his mother, founded the &quot;Kanye West Foundation&quot; in Chicago in 2003, tasked with a mission to battle dropout and illiteracy rates, while partnering with community organizations to provide underprivileged youth access to music education. In 2007, the West and the Foundation partnered with <a href="/wiki/Strong_American_Schools" title="Strong American Schools">Strong American Schools</a> as part of their &quot;Ed in &apos;08&quot; campaign. As spokesman for the campaign, West appeared in a series of PSAs for the organization, and hosted an inaugural benefit concert in August of that year.</p>
<p>In 2008, following the death of West&apos;s mother, the foundation was rechristened &quot;The Dr. Donda West Foundation.&quot;  The foundation ceased operations in 2011.</p>
<p>Kanye West and friend, <a href="/wiki/Rhymefest" title="Rhymefest">Rhymefest</a>, also founded &quot;Donda&apos;s House, Inc&quot;. Got Bars is the Donda&apos;s House signature music/lyric composition and performance program. Participants are selected through an application and audition process. Got Bars is a free music writing program with the goal of helping at-risk Chicago youth. It is aimed at students between 15 and 24, and includes lessons on how to write and record music. Their curriculum is based on the teaching philosophy and pedagogy of Dr. Donda West with a focus on collaborative and experiential learning.</p>
<p>West has additionally appeared and participated in many fundraisers, benefit concerts, and has done community work for <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> relief, the Kanye West Foundation, the <a href="/wiki/Millions_More_Movement" title="Millions More Movement">Millions More Movement</a>, <a href="/wiki/100_Black_Men_of_America" title="100 Black Men of America">100 Black Men of America</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Live_Earth" title="Live Earth">Live Earth</a> concert benefit, <a href="/wiki/World_Water_Day" title="World Water Day">World Water Day</a> rally and march, <a href="/wiki/Nike,_Inc." title="Nike, Inc.">Nike</a> runs, and a MTV special helping young <a href="/wiki/Iraq_War" title="Iraq War">Iraq War</a> veterans who struggle through debt and <a href="/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder" title="Posttraumatic stress disorder">PTSD</a> a second chance after returning home.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Controversies">Controversies</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="General_media">General media</span></h3>
<p>West has been an outspoken and controversial celebrity throughout his career, receiving both criticism and praise from many, including the mainstream media, other artists and entertainers, and two U.S. presidents. On September 2, 2005, during a benefit concert for <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> relief on NBC, <i><a href="/wiki/A_Concert_for_Hurricane_Relief" title="A Concert for Hurricane Relief">A Concert for Hurricane Relief</a></i>, West (a featured speaker) accused President <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> of not &quot;car[ing] about black people&quot;. When West was presenting alongside actor <a href="/wiki/Mike_Myers" title="Mike Myers">Mike Myers</a>, he deviated from the prepared script to criticize the media&apos;s portrayal of hurricane victims, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hate the way they portray us in the media. You see a black family, it says, &apos;They&apos;re looting.&apos; You see a white family, it says, &apos;They&apos;re looking for food.&apos; And, you know, it&apos;s been five days [waiting for federal help] because most of the people are black. And even for me to complain about it, I would be a hypocrite because I&apos;ve tried to turn away from the TV because it&apos;s too hard to watch. I&apos;ve even been shopping before even giving a donation, so now I&apos;m calling my business manager right now to see what is the biggest amount I can give, and just to imagine if I was down there, and those are my people down there. So anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can help&#x2014;with the way America is set up to help the poor, the black people, the less well-off, as slow as possible. I mean, the Red Cross is doing everything they can. We already realize a lot of people that could help are at war right now, fighting another way&#x2014;and they&apos;ve given them permission to go down and shoot us!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Myers spoke next and continued to read the script. Once it was West&apos;s turn to speak again, he said, &quot;George Bush doesn&apos;t care about black people.&quot; At this point, telethon producer Rick Kaplan cut off the microphone and then cut away to <a href="/wiki/Chris_Tucker" title="Chris Tucker">Chris Tucker</a>, who was unaware of the cut for a few seconds. Still, West&apos;s comment reached much of the United States.</p>
<p>Bush stated in an interview that the comment was &quot;one of the most disgusting moments&quot; of his presidency. In November 2010, in a taped interview with <a href="/wiki/Matt_Lauer" title="Matt Lauer">Matt Lauer</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Today_(NBC_program)" class="mw-redirect" title="Today (NBC program)"><i>Today</i> show</a>, West expressed regret for his criticism of Bush. &quot;I would tell George Bush in my moment of frustration, I didn&apos;t have the grounds to call him a racist&quot;, he told Lauer. &quot;I believe that in a situation of high emotion like that we as human beings don&apos;t always choose the right words.&quot; The following day, Bush reacted to the apology in a live interview with Lauer saying he appreciated the rapper&apos;s remorse. &quot;I&apos;m not a hater&quot;, Bush said. &quot;I don&apos;t hate Kanye West. I was talking about an environment in which people were willing to say things that hurt. Nobody wants to be called a racist if in your heart you believe in equality of races.&quot; Reactions were mixed, but some felt that West had no need to apologize. &quot;It was not the particulars of your words that mattered, it was the essence of a feeling of the insensitivity towards our communities that many of us have felt for far too long&quot;, argued <a href="/wiki/Def_Jam_Recordings" title="Def Jam Recordings">Def Jam</a> co-founder <a href="/wiki/Russell_Simmons" title="Russell Simmons">Russell Simmons</a>. Bush himself was receptive to the apology, saying, &quot;I appreciate that. It wasn&apos;t just Kanye West who was talking like that during Katrina, I cited him as an example, I cited others as an example as well. You know, I appreciate that.&quot;</p>
<p>In September 2013, West was widely rebuked by human rights groups for performing in <a href="/wiki/Kazakhstan" title="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a> at the wedding of authoritarian President <a href="/wiki/Nursultan_Nazarbayev" title="Nursultan Nazarbayev">Nursultan Nazarbayev</a>&apos;s grandson. He traveled to Kazakhstan, which has one of the <a href="/wiki/Human_rights_in_Kazakhstan" title="Human rights in Kazakhstan">poorest human rights records in the world</a>, as a personal guest of Nazarbayev. Other notable Western performers, including <a href="/wiki/Sting_(musician)" title="Sting (musician)">Sting</a>, have previously cancelled performances in the country over human rights concerns. West was reportedly paid US$3 million for his performance. West had previously participated in cultural boycotts, joining <a href="/wiki/Shakira" title="Shakira">Shakira</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rage_Against_The_Machine" class="mw-redirect" title="Rage Against The Machine">Rage Against The Machine</a> in refusing to perform in <a href="/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> after the 2010 implementation of stop and search laws directed against potential illegal aliens.</p>
<p>Later in 2013, West launched a tirade on <a href="/wiki/Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> directed at talk show host <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel" title="Jimmy Kimmel">Jimmy Kimmel</a> after his <a href="/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> program <i><a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel_Live!" title="Jimmy Kimmel Live!">Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a></i> ran a sketch on September 25 involving two children re-enacting West&apos;s recent interview with <a href="/wiki/Zane_Lowe" title="Zane Lowe">Zane Lowe</a> for <a href="/wiki/BBC_Radio_1" title="BBC Radio 1">BBC Radio 1</a> in which he calls himself the biggest rock star on the planet. Kimmel reveals the following night that West called him to demand an apology shortly before taping.</p>
<p>During a November 26, 2013 radio interview, West explained why he believed that President Obama had problems pushing policies in Washington: &quot;Man, let me tell you something about George Bush and oil money and Obama and no money. People want to say Obama can&apos;t make these moves or he&apos;s not executing. That&apos;s because he ain&apos;t got those connections. Black people don&apos;t have the same level of connections as Jewish people...We ain&apos;t Jewish. We don&apos;t got family that got money like that.&quot; In response to his comments, the <a href="/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League" title="Anti-Defamation League">Anti-Defamation League</a> stated: &quot;There it goes again, the age-old canard that Jews are all-powerful and control the levers of power in government.&quot; On December 21, 2013, West backed off of the original comment and told a Chicago radio station that &quot;I thought I was giving a compliment, but if anything it came off more ignorant. I don&apos;t know how being told you have money is an insult.&quot;</p>
<p>In February 2016, West again became embroiled in controversy when he posted a tweet seemingly asserting <a href="/wiki/Bill_Cosby" title="Bill Cosby">Bill Cosby</a>&apos;s innocence in <a href="/wiki/Bill_Cosby_sexual_assault_allegations" title="Bill Cosby sexual assault allegations">the wake of over 50 women making allegations of sexual assault directed at Cosby.</a> That same month, West became embroiled in a short-lived social media altercation with rapper <a href="/wiki/Wiz_Khalifa" title="Wiz Khalifa">Wiz Khalifa</a> on <a href="/wiki/Twitter" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> that eventually involved their mutual ex-partner, <a href="/wiki/Amber_Rose" title="Amber Rose">Amber Rose</a>, who protested to West&apos;s mention of her and Khalifa&apos;s child. The feud involved allegations by Rose concerning her sexual relationship with West, and received significant media attention. As of February 2, 2016, West and Khalifa had reconciled.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Award_shows">Award shows</span></h3>
<p>In 2004, West had his first of a number of public incidents during his attendance at music award events. At the <a href="/wiki/American_Music_Awards_of_2004" title="American Music Awards of 2004">American Music Awards of 2004</a>, West stormed out of the auditorium after losing Best New Artist to country singer <a href="/wiki/Gretchen_Wilson" title="Gretchen Wilson">Gretchen Wilson</a>. He later commented, &quot;I felt like I was definitely robbed [...] I was the best new artist this year.&quot; After the 2006 Grammy nominations were released, West said he would &quot;really have a problem&quot; if he did not win the Album of the Year, saying, &quot;I don&apos;t care what I do, I don&apos;t care how much I stunt &#x2013; you can never take away from the amount of work I put into it. I don&apos;t want to hear all of that <a href="/wiki/Political_correctness" title="Political correctness">politically correct</a> stuff.&quot; On November 2, 2006, when his &quot;Touch the Sky&quot; failed to win Best Video at the <a href="/wiki/MTV_Europe_Music_Awards" title="MTV Europe Music Awards">MTV Europe Music Awards</a>, West went onto the stage as the award was being presented to <a href="/wiki/Justice_(band)" title="Justice (band)">Justice</a> and <a href="/wiki/Simian_(band)" title="Simian (band)">Simian</a> for &quot;<a href="/wiki/We_Are_Your_Friends_(song)" title="We Are Your Friends (song)">We Are Your Friends</a>&quot; and argued that he should have won the award instead. Hundreds of news outlets worldwide criticized the outburst. On November 7, 2006, West apologized for this outburst publicly during his performance as support act for <a href="/wiki/U2" title="U2">U2</a> for their Vertigo concert in <a href="/wiki/Brisbane" title="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>. He later spoofed the incident on the 33rd season premiere of <i><a href="/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live" title="Saturday Night Live">Saturday Night Live</a></i> in September 2007.</p>
<p>On September 9, 2007, West suggested that his <a href="/wiki/Race_(classification_of_human_beings)" class="mw-redirect" title="Race (classification of human beings)">race</a> had something to do with his being overlooked for opening the <a href="/wiki/2007_MTV_Video_Music_Awards" title="2007 MTV Video Music Awards">2007 MTV Video Music Awards</a> (VMAs) in favor of <a href="/wiki/Britney_Spears" title="Britney Spears">Britney Spears</a>; he claimed, &quot;Maybe my skin&apos;s not right.&quot; West was performing at the event; that night, he lost all five awards that he was nominated for, including Best Male Artist and Video of the Year. After the show, he was visibly upset that he had lost at the VMAs two years in a row, stating that he would not come back to MTV ever again. He also appeared on several radio stations saying that when he made the song &quot;Stronger&quot; that it was his dream to open the VMAs with it. He has also stated that Spears has not had a hit in a long period of time and that MTV exploited her for ratings.</p>

<p>On September 13, 2009, during the <a href="/wiki/2009_MTV_Video_Music_Awards" title="2009 MTV Video Music Awards">2009 MTV Video Music Awards</a> while <a href="/wiki/Taylor_Swift" title="Taylor Swift">Taylor Swift</a> was accepting her award for Best Female Video for &quot;<a href="/wiki/You_Belong_with_Me" title="You Belong with Me">You Belong with Me</a>&quot;, West <a href="/wiki/Kanye_West_MTV_Video_Music_Awards_controversy" class="mw-redirect" title="Kanye West MTV Video Music Awards controversy">went on stage and grabbed the microphone</a> to proclaim that <a href="/wiki/Beyonc%C3%A9_Knowles" class="mw-redirect" title="Beyonc&#xE9; Knowles">Beyonc&#xE9;</a>&apos;s video for &quot;<a href="/wiki/Single_Ladies_(Put_a_Ring_on_It)" title="Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)">Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)</a>&quot;, nominated for the same award, was &quot;one of the best videos of all time&quot;. He was subsequently removed from the remainder of the show for his actions. When Beyonc&#xE9; later won the award for Best Video of the Year for &quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)&quot;, she called Swift up on stage so that she could finish her acceptance speech. West was criticized by various celebrities for the outburst, and by President <a href="/wiki/Barack_Obama" title="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a>, who called West a &quot;jackass&quot;. In addition, West&apos;s VMA disruption sparked a large influx of Internet photo <a href="/wiki/Meme" title="Meme">memes</a> with blogs, forums and &quot;tweets&quot; with the &quot;Let you finish&quot; photo-jokes. He posted a Tweet soon after the event where he stated, &quot;Everybody wanna booooo me but I&apos;m a fan of real pop culture... I&apos;m not crazy y&apos;all, I&apos;m just real.&quot; He then posted two apologies for the outburst on his personal blog; one on the night of the incident, and the other the following day, when he also apologized during an appearance on <i><a href="/wiki/The_Jay_Leno_Show" title="The Jay Leno Show">The Jay Leno Show</a></i>. After Swift appeared on <i><a href="/wiki/The_View_(U.S._TV_series)" title="The View (U.S. TV series)">The View</a></i> two days after the outburst, partly to discuss the matter, West called her to apologize personally. Swift said she accepted his apology.</p>
<p>In September 2010, West wrote a series of apologetic <a href="/wiki/Twitter" title="Twitter">tweets</a> addressed to Swift including &quot;Beyonce didn&apos;t need that. MTV didn&apos;t need that and Taylor and her family friends and fans definitely didn&apos;t want or need that&quot; and concluding with &quot;I&apos;m sorry Taylor.&quot; He also revealed he had written a song for Swift and if she did not accept the song, he would perform it himself. However, on November 8, 2010, in an interview with a Minnesota radio station, he seemed to recant his past apologies by attempting to describe the act at the 2009 awards show as &quot;selfless&quot; and downgrade the perception of disrespect it created. In <i>&quot;</i>Famous,&quot; a track from his 2016 album <i>The Life of Pablo</i>, West implies that this incident led to Swift&apos;s stardom, rapping, &quot;I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex/ Why? I made that bitch famous.&quot; After some media backlash about the reference, West posted on Twitter &quot;I did not diss Taylor Swift and I&apos;ve never dissed her...First thing is I&apos;m an artist and as an artist I will express how I feel with no censorship.&quot; He continued by adding that he had asked both Swift and his wife, Kim Kardashian, for permission to publish the line.</p>
<p>On February 8, 2015, at the <a href="/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Album_of_the_Year" title="Grammy Award for Album of the Year">57th Annual Grammy Awards</a>, West walked on stage as <a href="/wiki/Beck" title="Beck">Beck</a> was accepting his award for <a href="/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Album_of_the_Year" title="Grammy Award for Album of the Year">Album of the Year</a> and then walked off stage, leaving the audience to think he was joking . After the awards show, West stated in an interview that he was not joking and that &quot;Beck needs to respect artistry, he should have given his award to Beyonc&#xE9;&quot;. On February 26, 2015, he publicly apologized to Beck on Twitter.</p>
<p>On August 30, 2015, West was presented with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the <a href="/wiki/MTV_Video_Music_Award" title="MTV Video Music Award">MTV Video Music Awards</a>. In his acceptance speech, he stated, &quot;Y&apos;all might be thinking right now, &apos;I wonder did he smoke something before he came out here?&apos; And the answer is: &apos;Yes, I rolled up a little something. I knocked the edge off.&apos;&quot; At the end of his speech, he announced, &quot;I have decided in 2020 to run for president.&quot;</p>

<p>Music fans have turned to <a href="/wiki/Change.org" title="Change.org">Change.org</a> around the globe to try and block West&apos;s participation at various events. The largest unsuccessful petition has been to the <a href="/wiki/Glastonbury_Festival_2015" title="Glastonbury Festival 2015">Glastonbury Festival 2015</a> with 133,000+ voters stating they would prefer a rock band to headline.

In his Pan American Games Closing Ceremony performance, close to the end of his performance, West closed the show by tossing his faulty microphone in the air and walked off stage.</p>

<p>Adams sent condolences to Donda West&apos;s family but declined to publicly discuss the procedure, citing <a href="/wiki/Medical_confidentiality" class="mw-redirect" title="Medical confidentiality">confidentiality</a>. West&apos;s family, through celebrity attorney Ed McPherson, filed complaints with the Medical Board against Adams and Aboolian for violating patient confidentiality following her death.

Knievel took issue with a &quot;sexually charged video&quot; in which West takes on the persona of &quot;Evel Kanyevel&quot; and attempts flying a rocket over a canyon. The suit claimed infringement on Knievel&apos;s trademarked name and likeness. Knievel also claimed that the &quot;vulgar and offensive&quot; images depicted in the video damaged his reputation. The suit sought monetary damages and an injunction to stop distribution of the video. West&apos;s attorneys argued that the music video amounted to satire and therefore was covered under the <a href="/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="First Amendment to the United States Constitution">First Amendment</a>. Just days before his death in November 2007, Knievel amicably settled the suit after being paid a visit from West, saying, &quot;I thought he was a wonderful guy and quite a gentleman.&quot;</p>
<p>On September 11, 2008, West and his road manager/bodyguard Don &quot;Don C.&quot; Crowley were arrested at <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_International_Airport" title="Los Angeles International Airport">Los Angeles International Airport</a> and booked on charges of felony vandalism after an altercation with the <a href="/wiki/Paparazzi" title="Paparazzi">paparazzi</a> in which West and Crowley broke the photographers&apos; cameras.

West&apos;s and Crowley&apos;s arraignment was delayed from an original date of April 14, 2009.</p>
<p>West was arrested again on November 14, 2008 at the Hilton hotel near <a href="/wiki/Gateshead" title="Gateshead">Gateshead</a> after another scuffle involving a photographer outside the famous Tup Tup Palace nightclub in <a href="/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne" title="Newcastle upon Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a>.

<p>On July 19, 2013, West was leaving LAX as he was surrounded by dozens of <a href="/wiki/Paparazzi" title="Paparazzi">paparazzi</a>. West became increasingly agitated as a photographer, Daniel Ramos, continued to ask him why people were not allowed to speak in his presence. West then says, &quot;I told you don&apos;t talk to me, right? You trying to get me in trouble so I steal off on you and have to pay you like $250,000 and shit.&quot; Then he allegedly charged the man and grabbed him and his camera. The incident captured by <a href="/wiki/TMZ" title="TMZ">TMZ</a>, took place for a few seconds before a female voice can be heard telling West to stop. West then released the man, and his camera, and drove away from the scene. Medics were later called to the scene on behalf of the photographer who was grabbed. It was reported West could be charged with felony attempted robbery behind the matter. However, the charges were reduced to misdemeanor criminal battery and attempted grand theft. In March 2014, West was sentenced to serve two years&apos; probation for the misdemeanor battery conviction and required to attend 24 anger management sessions, perform 250 hours of community service and pay restitution to Ramos.</p>

<p>West is among the most critically acclaimed artists of the twenty-first century, receiving praise from music critics, fans, fellow musicians, artists, and wider cultural figures for his work. <a href="/wiki/AllMusic" title="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> editor Jason Birchmeier writes of his impact, &quot;As his career progressed throughout the early 21st century, West shattered certain stereotypes about rappers, becoming a superstar on his own terms without adapting his appearance, his rhetoric, or his music to fit any one musical mold.&quot; Jon Caramanica of <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> said that West has been &quot;a frequent lightning rod for controversy, a bombastic figure who can count rankling two presidents among his achievements.&quot; <a href="/wiki/Village_Voice_Media" title="Village Voice Media">Village Voice Media</a> senior editor Ben Westhoff dubbed him the greatest hip hop artist of all time, writing that &quot;he&apos;s made the best albums and changed the game the most, and his music is the most likely to endure,&quot; while <i><a href="/wiki/Complex_(magazine)" title="Complex (magazine)">Complex</a></i> called him the 21st century&apos;s &quot;most important artist of any art form, of any genre.&quot; In 2016, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> compared West to the late <a href="/wiki/David_Bowie" title="David Bowie">David Bowie</a> within the &quot;modern mainstream&quot;, arguing that &quot;there is nobody else who can sell as many records as West does [...] while remaining so resolutely experimental and capable of stirring things up culturally and politically.&quot;</p>
<p>West&apos;s middle-class background, flamboyant fashion sense and outspokenness have set him apart from other rappers. <i>Rolling Stone</i> credited West with transforming hip hop&apos;s mainstream, &quot;establishing a style of introspective yet glossy rap [...]&quot;, and called him &quot;as interesting and complicated a pop star as the 2000s produced&#x2014;a rapper who mastered, upped and moved beyond the hip-hop game, a producer who created a signature sound and then abandoned it to his imitators, a flashy, free-spending sybarite with insightful things to say about college, <a href="/wiki/Culture" title="Culture">culture</a> and <a href="/wiki/Economics" title="Economics">economics</a>, an egomaniac with more than enough artistic firepower to back it up.&quot; Early in his career, he was among the first rappers to publicly criticize the preponderance of <a href="/wiki/Homophobia" title="Homophobia">homophobia</a> in <a href="/wiki/Hip_hop" title="Hip hop">hip hop</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Graduation_(album)#Release_and_promotion" title="Graduation (album)">sales competition</a> between rapper 50 Cent&apos;s <i>Curtis</i> and West&apos;s <i>Graduation</i> altered the direction of hip hop and helped pave the way for new rappers who did not follow the <a href="/wiki/Hardcore_hip_hop" title="Hardcore hip hop">hardcore</a>-<a href="/wiki/Gangsta_rap" title="Gangsta rap">gangster</a> mold. Rosie Swash of <i>The Guardian</i> viewed the sales competition as a historical moment in hip-hop, because it &quot;highlighted the diverging facets of hip-hop in the last decade; the former was gangsta rap for the noughties, while West was the thinking man&apos;s alternative.&quot; His 2008 album <i>808s &amp; Heartbreak</i> polarized both listeners and critics upon its release, but was commercially successful and impacted hip hop and pop stylistically, as it laid the groundwork for a new wave of artists who generally eschewed typical rap braggadocio for intimate subject matter and introspection, including <a href="/wiki/Frank_Ocean" title="Frank Ocean">Frank Ocean</a>, <a href="/wiki/The_Weeknd" title="The Weeknd">The Weeknd</a>, <a href="/wiki/Drake_(rapper)" class="mw-redirect" title="Drake (rapper)">Drake</a>, <a href="/wiki/Future_(rapper)" title="Future (rapper)">Future</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kid_Cudi" title="Kid Cudi">Kid Cudi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Donald_Glover" title="Donald Glover">Childish Gambino</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lil_Durk" title="Lil Durk">Lil Durk</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chief_Keef" title="Chief Keef">Chief Keef</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Soulja_Boy" title="Soulja Boy">Soulja Boy</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Kanye West would be the first person to tell you he belongs on this list. The dude doesn&apos;t believe in false modesty, and he shouldn&apos;t [...] He fought for his place in the cultural pantheon with a purpose. In his debut album, over a decade ago, Kanye issued what amounted to a social critique and a call to arms (with a beat): &quot;We rappers is role models: we rap, we don&apos;t think.&quot; But Kanye does think. Constantly. About everything. And he wants everybody else to do the same: to engage, question, push boundaries. Now that he&apos;s a pop-culture juggernaut, he has the platform to achieve just that. He&apos;s not afraid of being judged or ridiculed in the process. Kanye&apos;s been playing the long game all along, and we&apos;re only just beginning to see why.&quot;</p>
