</div>

<p>A typical <a href="/wiki/Jews" title="Jews">Jew</a> in Jesus&apos; time <a href="/wiki/Jewish_name" title="Jewish name">had only one name</a>, sometimes <a href="/wiki/Patronymic" title="Patronymic">supplemented with the father&apos;s name</a> or the individual&apos;s hometown. Thus, in the New Testament, Jesus is commonly referred to as &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (e.g., <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Mark#10:47" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark">Mark 10:47</a>). Jesus&apos; neighbors in Nazareth refer to him as &quot;the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon&quot; (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Mark#6:3" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark">Mark 6:3</a>), &quot;the carpenter&apos;s son&quot; (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#13:55" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew">Matthew 13:55</a>), or &quot;Joseph&apos;s son&quot; (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#4:22" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke">Luke 4:22</a>). In John, the disciple Philip refers to him as &quot;Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth&quot; (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/John#1:45" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/John">John 1:45</a>).</p>
<p>The name <i>Jesus</i> is derived from the Latin <i>Iesus</i>, a <a href="/wiki/Transliteration" title="Transliteration">transliteration</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a> <span lang="grc">&#x1F38;&#x3B7;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x1FE6;&#x3C2;</span> (<i><span lang="grc-Latn">Iesous</span></i>).

The name <i>Yeshua</i> appears to have been in use in Judea at the time of the birth of Jesus. The first century works of historian <a href="/wiki/Josephus" title="Josephus">Flavius Josephus</a>, who wrote in <a href="/wiki/Koine_Greek" title="Koine Greek">Koine Greek</a>, the same language as that of the New Testament, refer to at least twenty different people with the name Jesus (i.e. &#x1F38;&#x3B7;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x1FE6;&#x3C2;). The etymology of Jesus&apos; name in the context of the New Testament is generally given as &quot;Yahweh is salvation&quot;.</p>
<p>Since early Christianity, Christians have commonly referred to Jesus as &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;. The word <i>Christ</i> is derived from the Greek <span lang="grc"><a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%A7%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CF%8C%CF%82" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:&#x3A7;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3CC;&#x3C2;">&#x3A7;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3CC;&#x3C2;</a></span> (<i>Christos</i>), which is a translation of the Hebrew <span lang="he"><a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D6%B8%D7%A9%D6%B4%D7%81%D7%99%D7%97%D6%B7" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:&#x5DE;&#x5B8;&#x5E9;&#x5B4;&#x5C1;&#x5D9;&#x5D7;&#x5B7;">&#x5DE;&#x5E9;&#x5D9;&#x5D7;</a></span> (<i>Meshiakh</i>), meaning the &quot;<a href="/wiki/Anointing" title="Anointing">anointed</a>&quot; and usually transliterated into English as &quot;<a href="/wiki/Messiah" title="Messiah">Messiah</a>&quot;. Christians designate Jesus as Christ because they believe he is the awaited Messiah <a href="/wiki/Jesus_and_messianic_prophecy" class="mw-redirect" title="Jesus and messianic prophecy">prophesied</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Hebrew_Bible" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> and Old Testament. In postbiblical usage, <i>Christ</i> became viewed as a name&#x2014;one part of &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;&#x2014;but originally it was a title. The term &quot;Christian&quot; (meaning &quot;one who owes allegiance to the person Christ&quot; or simply &quot;follower of Christ&quot;) has been in use since the first century.</p>

<p>The canonical gospels are four accounts, each written by a different author. According to the <a href="/wiki/Marcan_priority" title="Marcan priority">Marcan priority</a>, the first to be written was the Gospel of Mark (written AD 60&#x2013;75), followed by the Gospel of Matthew (AD 65&#x2013;85), the Gospel of Luke (AD 65&#x2013;95), and the Gospel of John (AD 75&#x2013;100). They often differ in content and in the ordering of events.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the writing of the gospels has been attributed to <a href="/wiki/Four_evangelists" class="mw-redirect" title="Four evangelists">four evangelists</a> with close ties to Jesus: Mark was written by <a href="/wiki/John_Mark" title="John Mark">John Mark</a>, an associate of Peter; Matthew was written by one of Jesus&apos; disciples; Luke was written by a companion of Paul, someone mentioned in a few epistles; and John was written by another of Jesus&apos; disciples, in fact part of an inner group of disciples, along with Peter and John&apos;s brother James.</p>
<p>Three of them, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, are known as the Synoptic Gospels, from the Greek &#x3C3;&#x3CD;&#x3BD; (<i>syn</i> &quot;together&quot;) and &#x1F44;&#x3C8;&#x3B9;&#x3C2; (<i>opsis</i> &quot;view&quot;). They are similar in content, narrative arrangement, language and paragraph structure. Scholars generally agree that it is impossible to find any direct literary relationship between the Synoptic Gospels and the Gospel of John. While the flow of some events (such as Jesus&apos; baptism, <a href="/wiki/Transfiguration_of_Jesus" title="Transfiguration of Jesus">transfiguration</a>, crucifixion and interactions with the <a href="/wiki/Apostle_(Christian)" title="Apostle (Christian)">apostles</a>) are shared among the Synoptic Gospels, incidents such as the transfiguration do not appear in John, which also differs on other matters, such as the <a href="/wiki/Cleansing_of_the_Temple" title="Cleansing of the Temple">Cleansing of the Temple</a>.</p>

<p>Most scholars agree, following what is known as the &quot;Marcan hypothesis&quot;, that the authors of Matthew and Luke used Mark as a source when writing their gospels. Matthew and Luke also share some content not found in Mark. To explain this, many scholars believe that in addition to Mark, another source (commonly called the &quot;<a href="/wiki/Q_source" title="Q source">Q source</a>&quot;) was used by the two authors.</p>
<p>According to a broad scholarly consensus, the Synoptic Gospels, and not John, are the primary sources of historical information about Jesus. However, not everything contained in the New Testament gospels is considered to be historically reliable. Elements whose historical authenticity is disputed include the <a href="/wiki/Nativity_of_Jesus" title="Nativity of Jesus">Nativity</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Massacre_of_the_Innocents" title="Massacre of the Innocents">Massacre of the Innocents</a>, the Resurrection, the Ascension, some of Jesus&apos; miracles, and the <a href="/wiki/Sanhedrin_trial_of_Jesus" title="Sanhedrin trial of Jesus">Sanhedrin trial</a>, among others. Views on the gospels range from their being <a href="/wiki/Inerrancy" class="mw-redirect" title="Inerrancy">inerrant</a> descriptions of the life of Jesus to their providing little historical information about his life beyond the basics.</p>
<p>The Synoptics emphasize different aspects of Jesus. In Mark, Jesus is the <a href="/wiki/Son_of_God_(Christianity)" title="Son of God (Christianity)">Son of God</a> whose mighty works demonstrate the presence of <a href="/wiki/God%27s_Kingdom" class="mw-redirect" title="God&apos;s Kingdom">God&apos;s Kingdom</a>. He is a tireless wonder worker, the servant of both God and man. This short gospel records few of Jesus&apos; words or teachings. The Gospel of Matthew emphasizes that Jesus is the fulfillment of God&apos;s will as revealed in the Old Testament, and he is the Lord of the Church. He is the kingly Messiah, referred to repeatedly as &quot;king&quot; and &quot;<a href="/wiki/Davidic_line" title="Davidic line">Son of David</a>.&quot; A noteworthy feature of this gospel are the five discourses, collections of teachings on particular themes, including the Sermon on the Mount. Luke presents Jesus as the divine-human savior who shows compassion to the needy. He is the friend of sinners and outcasts, come to seek and save the lost. This gospel includes Jesus&apos; most beloved parables, such as the Good Samaritan and the Prodigal Son.</p>
<p>The Synoptics and John agree on the main outline of Jesus&apos; life. John the Baptist precedes Jesus, their ministries overlap, and John witnesses to Jesus&apos; identity. Jesus teaches and performs miracles, at least partly in Galilee. He then visits Jerusalem, where the leaders have him crucified, and he is buried. After his tomb is found empty on Sunday, the risen Jesus presents himself to his followers.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/John_1:1" title="John 1:1">prologue to the Gospel of John</a> identifies Jesus as an incarnation of the divine Word (<a href="/wiki/Logos_(Christianity)" title="Logos (Christianity)">Logos</a>). As the Word, Jesus was eternally present with God, active in all creation, and the source of humanity&apos;s moral and spiritual nature. With this prologue, the evangelist establishes that Jesus is not only greater than any past human prophet but greater than any prophet could be. He not only speaks God&apos;s Word; he is God&apos;s Word. In the Gospel of John, Jesus reveals his divine role publicly. Here he is the Bread of Life, the Light of the World, the True Vine and more.</p>
<p>In general, the authors of the New Testament showed little interest in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age. As stated in <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/John#21:25" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/John">John 21:25</a>, the gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in the life of Jesus. The accounts were primarily written as theological documents in the context of <a href="/wiki/Early_Christianity" title="Early Christianity">early Christianity</a>, with timelines as a secondary consideration. One manifestation of the gospels as theological documents rather than historical chronicles is that they devote about one third of their text to just seven days, namely the last week of the life of Jesus in <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, referred to as <a href="/wiki/Passion_(Christianity)" title="Passion (Christianity)">the Passion</a>. Although the gospels do not provide enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates, it is possible to draw from them a general picture of the life story of Jesus.</p>

<p>Matthew and Luke each offer a genealogy of Jesus. Matthew traces Jesus&apos; ancestry to <a href="/wiki/Abraham" title="Abraham">Abraham</a> through <a href="/wiki/David" title="David">David</a>. Luke traces Jesus&apos; ancestry through <a href="/wiki/Adam" title="Adam">Adam</a> to God. The lists are identical between Abraham and David, but differ radically from that point. Traditional Christian scholars (starting with the historian Eusebius) have put forward various theories that seek to explain why the lineages are so different, such as that Matthew&apos;s account follows the lineage of Joseph, while Luke&apos;s follows the lineage of Mary. Modern biblical scholars such as <a href="/wiki/Marcus_J._Borg" class="mw-redirect" title="Marcus J. Borg">Marcus J. Borg</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Dominic_Crossan" title="John Dominic Crossan">John Dominic Crossan</a> see both genealogies as inventions, conforming to Jewish literary convention.</p>
<p>Matthew and Luke each describe Jesus&apos; nativity (or birth), especially that Jesus was born of a virgin in <a href="/wiki/Bethlehem" title="Bethlehem">Bethlehem</a> in fulfillment of prophecy. Luke&apos;s account emphasizes events before the birth of Jesus and centers on Mary, while Matthew&apos;s mostly covers those after the birth and centers on Joseph. Both accounts state that Jesus was born to <a href="/wiki/Saint_Joseph" title="Saint Joseph">Joseph</a> and Mary, his <a href="/wiki/Betrothed" class="mw-redirect" title="Betrothed">betrothed</a>, in Bethlehem, and both support the doctrine of the virgin birth, according to which Jesus was miraculously conceived by the Holy Spirit in Mary&apos;s womb when she was still a virgin. The virgin birth has been a consistent tenet of orthodox Christian belief, although a number of liberal theologians have questioned it in the last 150 years. Matthew repeatedly cites the Old Testament to support the belief that Jesus is the Jews&apos; promised Messiah.</p>
<p>In Matthew, Joseph is troubled because Mary, his betrothed, is pregnant (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#1:19" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew">Matthew 1:19&#x2013;20</a>), but in the first of <a href="/wiki/St._Joseph%27s_dream" title="St. Joseph&apos;s dream">Joseph&apos;s three dreams</a> an angel assures him not to be afraid to take Mary as his wife, because her child was conceived by the Holy Spirit.

<p>Jesus&apos; childhood home is identified in the gospels of Luke and Matthew as the town of Nazareth in Galilee where he lived with his family. Although Joseph appears in descriptions of Jesus&apos; childhood, no mention is made of him thereafter. His other family members&#x2014;his mother, Mary, his brothers <a href="/wiki/James_the_Just" class="mw-redirect" title="James the Just">James</a>, Joses (or Joseph), Judas and Simon and his unnamed sisters&#x2014;are mentioned in the gospels and other sources.</p>
<p>According to Stephen L. Harris, Gospel of Mark says that Jesus comes into conflict with his neighbors and family. Jesus&apos; mother and brothers come to get him (3:31&#x2013;35) because people are saying that he is crazy (3:21). Jesus responds that his followers are his true family. In John, Mary follows Jesus to his crucifixion, and he expresses concern over her well-being (19:25&#x2013;27).</p>
<p>Jesus is called a &#x3C4;&#x3AD;&#x3BA;&#x3C4;&#x3C9;&#x3BD; (<i>tekton</i>) in <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Mark#6:3" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark">Mark 6:3</a>, traditionally understood as carpenter but could cover makers of objects in various materials, including builders. The gospels indicate that Jesus could read, paraphrase, and debate scripture, but this does not necessarily mean that he received formal scribal training. When Jesus is presented in the temple per Jewish Law, a man named Simeon says to Mary and Joseph that Jesus &quot;shall stand as a sign of contradiction, while a sword will pierce your own soul. Then the secret thoughts of many will come to light.&quot;(<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#2:35" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke">Luke 2:28-35</a>) When Jesus goes missing, they find him in the temple sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking questions, and the people are amazed at his understanding and answers; Mary scolds Jesus for going missing, to which Jesus replies that he must &quot;be in his father&apos;s house.&quot;(<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#2:41" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke">Luke 2:41-52</a>)</p>

<p>The Synoptic accounts of Jesus&apos; baptism are all preceded by information about John the Baptist. They show John preaching penance and repentance for the remission of sins and encouraging the giving of <a href="/wiki/Alms" title="Alms">alms</a> to the poor (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#3:11" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke">Luke 3:11</a>) as he baptizes people in the area of the <a href="/wiki/River_Jordan" class="mw-redirect" title="River Jordan">River Jordan</a> around <a href="/wiki/Perea_(Holy_Land)" class="mw-redirect" title="Perea (Holy Land)">Perea</a> and foretells (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#3:16" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke">Luke 3:16</a>) the arrival of someone &quot;more powerful&quot; than he. Later, Jesus identifies John as &quot;the Elijah who was to come&quot; (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#11:14" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew">Matthew 11:14</a>, <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Mark#9:13" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark">Mark 9:13-14</a>), the prophet who was expected to arrive before the &quot;great and terrible day of the Lord&quot; (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Malachi#4:5" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Malachi">Malachi 4:5</a>). Likewise, Luke says that John had the spirit and power of Elijah (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#1:17" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke">Luke 1:17</a>).</p>
<p>In Mark, John baptizes Jesus, and as he comes out of the water he see the Holy Spirit descending to him like a dove and he hears a voice from heaven declaring him to be God&apos;s son (Mark 1:9&#x2013;11). This is one of two events described in the gospels where a voice from Heaven calls Jesus &quot;Son&quot;, the other being the Transfiguration. The spirit then drives him into the wilderness where he is tempted by Satan (Mark 1:12&#x2013;13). Jesus then begins his ministry after John&apos;s arrest (Mark 1:14). Jesus&apos; baptism in Matthew is similar. Here, before Jesus&apos; baptism, John protests, saying, &quot;I need to be baptized by you&quot; (Matthew 3:14). Jesus instructs him to carry on with the baptism &quot;to fulfill all righteousness&quot; (Matthew 3:15). Matthew also details the three temptations that Satan offers Jesus in the wilderness (Matthew 4:3&#x2013;11). In Luke, the Holy Spirit descends as a dove after everyone has been baptized and Jesus is praying (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#3:21" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke">Luke 3:21-22</a>). John implicitly recognizes Jesus from prison after sending his followers to ask about him (Luke 7:18&#x2013;23). Jesus&apos; baptism and temptation serve as preparation for his public ministry.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John leaves out Jesus&apos; baptism and temptation. Here, John the Baptist testifies that he saw the Spirit descend on Jesus (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/John#1:32" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/John">John 1:32</a>). John publicly proclaims Jesus as the sacrificial Lamb of God, and some of John&apos;s followers become disciples of Jesus. In this Gospel, John denies that he is Elijah (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/John#1:21" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/John">John 1:21</a>). Before John is imprisoned, Jesus leads his followers to baptize disciples as well (John 3:22-24), and they baptize more people than John (John 4:1).</p>

<p>The Synoptics depict two distinct geographical settings in Jesus&apos; ministry. The first takes place north of Judea in Galilee, where Jesus conducts a successful ministry; and the second shows Jesus rejected and killed when he travels to Jerusalem. Notably, Jesus forbids those who recognize his identity to speak of it, including people he heals and demons he exorcises (see <a href="/wiki/Messianic_Secret" title="Messianic Secret">Messianic Secret</a>).</p>
<p>John depicts Jesus&apos; ministry as largely taking place in and around Jerusalem rather than in Galilee. In this Gospel, Jesus&apos; divine identity is publicly proclaimed and immediately recognized.</p>
<p>Scholars divide the ministry of Jesus into several stages. The Galilean ministry begins when Jesus returns to Galilee from the Judaean Desert after rebuffing the temptation of <a href="/wiki/Satan" title="Satan">Satan</a>. Jesus preaches around Galilee, and in <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#4:18" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew">Matthew 4:18&#x2013;20</a>, <a href="/wiki/First_disciples_of_Jesus" title="First disciples of Jesus">his first disciples</a>, who will eventually form the core of the early Church, encounter him and begin to travel with him. This period includes the Sermon on the Mount, one of Jesus&apos; major discourses, as well as the <a href="/wiki/Calming_the_storm" title="Calming the storm">calming of the storm</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Feeding_the_multitude" title="Feeding the multitude">feeding of the 5,000</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jesus%27_walk_on_water" class="mw-redirect" title="Jesus&apos; walk on water">walking on water</a> and a number of other miracles and <a href="/wiki/Parables_of_Jesus" title="Parables of Jesus">parables</a>. It ends with the <a href="/wiki/Confession_of_Peter" title="Confession of Peter">Confession of Peter</a> and the Transfiguration.</p>
<p>As Jesus travels towards Jerusalem, in the <a href="/wiki/Perea_(Bible)" class="mw-redirect" title="Perea (Bible)">Perean</a> ministry, he returns to the area where he was baptized, about a third of the way down from the <a href="/wiki/Sea_of_Galilee" title="Sea of Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a> along the Jordan (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/John#10:40" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/John">John 10:40&#x2013;42</a>).

</div>
<p>Near the beginning of his ministry, Jesus <a href="/wiki/Commissioning_of_the_Twelve_Apostles" title="Commissioning of the Twelve Apostles">appoints twelve apostles</a>. In Matthew and Mark, despite Jesus only briefly requesting that they join him, Jesus&apos; first four apostles, who were fishermen, are described as immediately consenting, and abandoning their nets and boats to do so (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#4:18" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew">Matthew 4:18&#x2013;22</a>, <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Mark#1:16" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark">Mark 1:16&#x2013;20</a>). In John, Jesus&apos; first two apostles were disciples of John the Baptist. The Baptist sees Jesus and calls him the <a href="/wiki/Lamb_of_God" title="Lamb of God">Lamb of God</a>; the two hear this and follow Jesus. In addition to the Twelve Apostles, the opening of the passage of the <a href="/wiki/Sermon_on_the_Plain" title="Sermon on the Plain">Sermon on the Plain</a> identifies a much larger group of people as disciples (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#6:17" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke">Luke 6:17</a>). Also, in <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#10:1" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke">Luke 10:1&#x2013;16</a> Jesus sends <a href="/wiki/Seventy_disciples" title="Seventy disciples">seventy or seventy-two of his followers</a> in pairs to prepare towns for his prospective visit. They are instructed to accept hospitality, heal the sick and spread the word that the Kingdom of God is coming.</p>
<p>In Mark, the disciples are notably obtuse. They fail to understand Jesus&apos; miracles (Mark 4:35&#x2013;41, 6:52), his parables (Mark 4:13), or what &quot;rising from the dead&quot; would mean (Mark 9:9&#x2013;10). When Jesus is later arrested, they desert him (see below).</p>

<p>In the Synoptics, Jesus teaches extensively, often in parables, about the Kingdom of God (or, in Matthew, the Kingdom of Heaven). The Kingdom is described as both imminent (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Mark#1:15" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark">Mark 1:15</a>) and already present in the ministry of Jesus (Luke 17:21). Jesus promises inclusion in the Kingdom for those who accept his message (Mark 10:13&#x2013;27). Jesus talks of the &quot;Son of Man,&quot; an apocalyptic figure who would come to gather the chosen.</p>
<p>Jesus calls people to repent their sins and to devote themselves completely to God. Jesus tells his followers to adhere to <a href="/wiki/Jewish_law" class="mw-redirect" title="Jewish law">Jewish law</a>, although he is perceived by some to have broken the law himself, for example regarding the <a href="/wiki/Sabbath" title="Sabbath">Sabbath</a>. When asked what the greatest commandment is, Jesus replies: &quot;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind&#xA0;... And a second is like it: &#x2018;You shall love your neighbor as yourself&quot; (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#22:37" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew">Matthew 22:37&#x2013;39</a>). Other ethical teachings of Jesus include <a href="/wiki/Matthew_5:44" title="Matthew 5:44">loving one&apos;s enemies</a>, refraining from hatred and lust, and <a href="/wiki/Turning_the_other_cheek" title="Turning the other cheek">turning the other cheek</a> (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#5:21" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew">Matthew 5:21&#x2013;44</a>). In the Gospel of John, when an adulteress is about to be stoned to death in accordance with Moses&apos; Law, the Pharisees ask Jesus what he will say in this situation, to which Jesus replied &quot;Let anyone among you who has no sin be the first to throw a stone at her&quot;, causing the accusers to go away, and Jesus says to the woman that he does not condemn her for no one has, and tells her to not sin again (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/John#8:1" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/John">John 8:1-11</a>).</p>
<p>John&apos;s Gospel presents the teachings of Jesus not merely as his own preaching, but as divine revelation. John the Baptist, for example, states in <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/John#3:34" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/John">John 3:34</a>: &quot;He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure.&quot; In <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/John#7:16" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/John">John 7:16</a> Jesus says, &quot;My teaching is not mine but his who sent me.&quot; He asserts the same thing in <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/John#14:10" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/John">John 14:10</a>: &quot;Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works.&quot;</p>

<p>In the gospels, the approximately thirty parables form about one third of Jesus&apos; recorded teachings. The parables appear within longer sermons and at other places in the narrative. They often contain symbolism, and usually relate the physical world to the <a href="/wiki/Spirituality" title="Spirituality">spiritual</a>. Common themes in these tales include the kindness and generosity of God and the perils of transgression. Some of his parables, such as the <a href="/wiki/Parable_of_the_Prodigal_Son" title="Parable of the Prodigal Son">Prodigal Son</a> (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#15:11" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke">Luke 15:11&#x2013;32</a>), are relatively simple, while others, such as the <a href="/wiki/Parable_of_the_Growing_Seed" title="Parable of the Growing Seed">Growing Seed</a> (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Mark#4:26" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark">Mark 4:26&#x2013;29</a>), are sophisticated, profound and abstruse. When asked by his disciples about why he speaks in parables to the people, Jesus replies that the chosen disciples have been given to &quot;know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven&quot;, unlike the rest of their people, &quot;For the one who has will be given more and he will have in abundance. But the one who does not have will be deprived even more.&quot;, going on to say that the majority of their generation have grown &quot;dull hearts&quot; and thus are unable to understand (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#13:10" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew">Matthew 13:10-17</a>).</p>
<p>In the gospel accounts, Jesus devotes a large portion of his ministry performing miracles, especially healings. The miracles can be classified into two main categories: healing miracles and nature miracles. The healing miracles include cures for physical ailments, exorcisms, and resurrections of the dead. The nature miracles show Jesus&apos; power over nature, and include <a href="/wiki/Turning_water_into_wine" class="mw-redirect" title="Turning water into wine">turning water into wine</a>, walking on water, and calming a storm, among others. Jesus states that his miracles are from a divine source. When Jesus&apos; opponents suddenly accuse him of performing exorcisms by the power of <a href="/wiki/Beelzebul" class="mw-redirect" title="Beelzebul">Beelzebul</a>, the prince of demons, Jesus counters that he performs them by the &quot;Spirit of God&quot; (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#12:28" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew">Matthew 12:28</a>) or &quot;finger of God&quot;, arguing that all logic suggests that Satan would not let his demons assist the Children of God because it would divide Satan&apos;s house and bring his kingdom to desolation; furthermore, he asks his opponents that if he exorcises by Beel&apos;zebub, &quot;by whom do your sons cast them out?&quot;(<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#11:20" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke">Luke 11:20</a>). In <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#12:28" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew">Matthew 12:31-32</a>, he goes on to say that while all manner of sin, &quot;even insults against God&quot; or &quot;insults against the son of man&quot;, shall be forgiven, whoever insults goodness (or &quot;The <a href="/wiki/Holy_Spirit" title="Holy Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>&quot;) shall never be forgiven; he/she carries the guilt of his/her sin forever.</p>
<p>In John, Jesus&apos; miracles are described as &quot;signs&quot;, performed to prove his mission and divinity. However, in the Synoptics, when asked by some teachers of the Law and some Pharisees to give miraculous signs to prove his authority, Jesus refuses, saying that no sign shall come to corrupt and evil people except the sign of the prophet <a href="/wiki/Jonah" title="Jonah">Jonah</a>. Also, in the Synoptic Gospels, the crowds regularly respond to Jesus&apos; miracles with awe and press on him to heal their sick. In John&apos;s Gospel, Jesus is presented as unpressured by the crowds, who often respond to his miracles with trust and faith. One characteristic shared among all miracles of Jesus in the gospel accounts is that he performed them freely and never requested or accepted any form of payment. The gospel episodes that include descriptions of the miracles of Jesus also often include teachings, and the miracles themselves involve an element of teaching. Many of the miracles teach the importance of faith. In the <a href="/wiki/Cleansing_ten_lepers" title="Cleansing ten lepers">cleansing of ten lepers</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Daughter_of_Jairus" class="mw-redirect" title="Daughter of Jairus">raising of Jairus&apos; daughter</a>, for instance, the beneficiaries are told that their healing was due to their faith.</p>

<p>At about the middle of each of the three Synoptic Gospels, two related episodes mark a turning point in the narrative: the Confession of <a href="/wiki/Saint_Peter" title="Saint Peter">Peter</a> and the Transfiguration of Jesus. These events mark the beginnings of the gradual disclosure of the identity of Jesus to his disciples and his prediction of his own suffering and death. These two events are omitted in the Gospel of John.</p>
<p>In his Confession, Peter tells Jesus, &quot;You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.&quot; Jesus affirms that Peter&apos;s confession is divinely revealed truth.</p>
<p>In the Transfiguration (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#17:1" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew">Matthew 17:1&#x2013;9</a>, <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Mark#9:2" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark">Mark 9:2&#x2013;8</a>, and <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#9:28" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke">Luke 9:28&#x2013;36</a>), Jesus takes Peter and two other apostles up an unnamed mountain, where &quot;he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became dazzling white.&quot; A bright cloud appears around them, and a voice from the cloud says, &quot;This is my Son, the Beloved; with him I am well pleased; listen to him&quot; (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#17:1" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew">Matthew 17:1&#x2013;9</a>). In <a href="/wiki/2_Peter" class="mw-redirect" title="2 Peter">2 Peter</a> 1:16-18, Peter himself affirms that he witnessed Jesus&apos; Transfiguration, stating that the apostolic tradition is based on eyewitness testimony.</p>

<p>In the Synoptics, the last week in Jerusalem is the conclusion of the journey through Perea and <a href="/wiki/Judea" title="Judea">Judea</a> that Jesus began in Galilee. Jesus rides a young donkey into Jerusalem, reflecting an oracle from the <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Zechariah" title="Book of Zechariah">Book of Zechariah</a> in which the Jews&apos; humble king enters Jerusalem this way (Zechariah 9:9). People along the way lay cloaks and small branches of trees (known as palm fronds) in front of him and sing part of <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Psalms#118:25" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Psalms">Psalm 118:25&#x2013;26</a>.</p>
<p>Jesus next expels the money changers from the Temple, accusing them of turning it into a den of thieves through their commercial activities. Jesus then prophesies about the coming destruction, including false prophets, wars, earthquakes, celestial disorders, persecution of the faithful, the appearance of an &quot;abomination of desolation,&quot; and unendurable tribulations (Mark 13:1&#x2013;23). The mysterious &quot;Son of Man,&quot; he says, will dispatch angels to gather the faithful from all parts of the earth (Mark 13:24&#x2013;27). According to Stephen L. Harris, Jesus warns that these wonders will occur in the lifetimes of the hearers (Mark 13:28&#x2013;32). In John, the Cleansing of the Temple occurs at the beginning of Jesus&apos; ministry instead of the end <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/John#2:13" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/John">John 2:13&#x2013;16</a>.</p>
<p>Also in the Synoptics, Jesus comes into conflict with the Jewish elders, such as when they <a href="/wiki/Authority_of_Jesus_questioned" title="Authority of Jesus questioned">question his authority</a> and when he <a href="/wiki/Woes_of_the_Pharisees" title="Woes of the Pharisees">criticizes them and calls them hypocrites</a>. <a href="/wiki/Judas_Iscariot" title="Judas Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a>, one of the <a href="/wiki/Twelve_apostles" class="mw-redirect" title="Twelve apostles">twelve apostles</a>, secretly strikes a bargain with the Jewish elder, agreeing to betray Jesus to them for <a href="/wiki/Thirty_silver_coins" class="mw-redirect" title="Thirty silver coins">30 silver coins</a>.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John recounts of two other feasts in which Jesus taught in Jerusalem before the Passion Week (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/John#7:1" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/John">John 7:1&#x2013;10:42</a>). He returns near Jerusalem, in <a href="/wiki/Bethany_(biblical_village)" title="Bethany (biblical village)">Bethany</a>, when he <a href="/wiki/Raising_of_Lazarus" title="Raising of Lazarus">raises Lazarus from the dead</a>, which increases the tension between him and the authorities. The authorities then conspire to kill him (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/John#11:1" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/John">John 11</a>). Raising Lazarus is Jesus&apos; most potent sign yet. In Bethany, Mary of Bethany anoints Jesus&apos; feet, foreshadowing his entombment. Jesus then makes his Messianic entry into Jerusalem. The cheering crowds greeting Jesus as he enters Jerusalem add to the animosity between him and the establishment. In John, Jesus has already cleansed the Temple during an earlier Passover visit to Jerusalem. John next recounts Jesus&apos; Last Supper with his disciples.</p>

<p>The Last Supper is the final meal that Jesus shares with his <a href="/wiki/Twelve_Apostles#The_Twelve_Apostles" class="mw-redirect" title="Twelve Apostles">12 apostles</a> in Jerusalem before his crucifixion. The Last Supper is mentioned in all four canonical gospels; Paul&apos;s <a href="/wiki/First_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians" title="First Epistle to the Corinthians">First Epistle to the Corinthians</a> (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/1_Corinthians#11:23" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians">11:23&#x2013;26</a>) also refers to it. During the meal, <a href="/wiki/Jesus_predicts_his_betrayal" title="Jesus predicts his betrayal">Jesus predicts</a> that one of his apostles will betray him. Despite each Apostle&apos;s assertion that he would not betray him, Jesus reiterates that the betrayer would be one of those present. <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#26:23" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew">Matthew 26:23&#x2013;25</a> and <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/John#13:26" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/John">John 13:26&#x2013;27</a> specifically identify Judas as the traitor.</p>
<p>In the Synoptics, Jesus takes bread, breaks it, and gives it to the disciples, saying, &quot;This is my body, which is given for you&quot;. He then has them all drink from a cup, saying, &quot;This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood&quot; (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#22:19" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke">Luke 22:19&#x2013;20</a>).

Although the Gospel of John does not include a description of the bread-and-wine ritual during the Last Supper, most scholars agree that <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/John#6:22" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/John">John 6:22&#x2013;59</a> (the <a href="/wiki/Bread_of_Life_Discourse" title="Bread of Life Discourse">Bread of Life Discourse</a>) has a eucharistic character and resonates with the <a href="/wiki/Origin_of_the_Eucharist#Institution_narratives" title="Origin of the Eucharist">institution narratives</a> in the Synoptic Gospels and in the Pauline writings on the Last Supper.</p>
<p>In all four gospels, Jesus predicts that Peter will deny knowledge of him three times before the <a href="/wiki/Rooster" title="Rooster">rooster</a> crows the next morning. In Luke and John, the prediction is made during the Supper (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#22:33" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke">Luke 22:34</a>, <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/John#22:33" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/John">John 22:34</a>). In Matthew and Mark, the prediction is made after the Supper; Jesus also predicts that all his disciples will desert him (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#26:31" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew">Matthew 26:31&#x2013;34</a>, <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Mark#14:27" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark">Mark 14:27&#x2013;30</a>).

<p>During the trials Jesus speaks very little, mounts no defense, and gives very infrequent and indirect answers to the priests&apos; questions, prompting an officer to slap him. In <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#26:62" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew">Matthew 26:62</a> Jesus&apos; unresponsiveness leads Caiaphas to ask him, &quot;Have you no answer?&quot; In <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Mark#14:61" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark">Mark 14:61</a> the high priest then asks Jesus, &quot;Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?&quot; Jesus replies, &quot;I am&quot;, and then predicts the coming of the <a href="/wiki/Son_of_man_(Christianity)" title="Son of man (Christianity)">Son of Man</a>. This provokes Caiaphas to tear his own robe in anger and to accuse Jesus of blasphemy. In Matthew and Luke, Jesus&apos; answer is more ambiguous: in <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#26:64" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew">Matthew 26:64</a> he responds, &quot;You have said so&quot;, and in <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#22:70" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke">Luke 22:70</a> he says, &quot;You say that I am&quot;.</p>
<p>They take Jesus to <a href="/wiki/Pilate%27s_Court" class="mw-redirect" title="Pilate&apos;s Court">Pilate&apos;s Court</a>, but Pilate proves extremely reluctant to condemn Jesus; according to Robert W. Funk, it is the Jewish elders who are to blame for Jesus&apos; crucifixion. <a href="/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo" title="Augustine of Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a> says that Pilate was not free from blame, since he exercised his power to execute Jesus. The Jewish elders ask the Roman governor Pontius Pilate to judge and condemn Jesus, accusing him of claiming to be the King of the Jews. The use of the word &quot;king&quot; is central to the discussion between Jesus and Pilate. In <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/John#18:36" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/John">John 18:36</a> Jesus states, &quot;My kingdom is not from this world&quot;, but he does not unequivocally deny being the King of the Jews. In <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#23:7" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke">Luke 23:7&#x2013;15</a> Pilate realizes that Jesus is a Galilean, and thus comes under the jurisdiction of <a href="/wiki/Herod_Antipas" title="Herod Antipas">Herod Antipas</a>. Pilate sends Jesus to Herod to be tried, but Jesus says almost nothing in response to Herod&apos;s questions. Herod and his soldiers mock Jesus, put an expensive robe on him to make him look like a king, and return him to Pilate, who then calls together the Jewish elders and announces that he has &quot;not found this man guilty&quot;.</p>
<p>Observing a <a href="/wiki/Passover" title="Passover">Passover</a> custom of the time, Pilate allows one prisoner chosen by the crowd to be released. He gives the people a choice between Jesus and a murderer called <a href="/wiki/Barabbas" title="Barabbas">Barabbas</a>. Persuaded by the elders (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#27:20" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew">Matthew 27:20</a>), the mob chooses to release Barabbas and crucify Jesus. Pilate writes a sign in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek that reads &quot;Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews&quot; (abbreviated as <a href="/wiki/INRI" class="mw-redirect" title="INRI">INRI</a> in depictions) to be affixed to Jesus&apos; cross (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/John#19:19" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/John">John 19:19&#x2013;20</a>), then <a href="/wiki/Flagellation_of_Christ" title="Flagellation of Christ">scourges Jesus</a> and sends him to be crucified.

<p>Jesus&apos; crucifixion is described in all four canonical gospels. After the trials, Jesus is led to <a href="/wiki/Calvary" title="Calvary">Calvary</a> <a href="/wiki/Christ_Carrying_the_Cross" title="Christ Carrying the Cross">carrying his cross</a>; the route traditionally thought to have been taken is known as the <a href="/wiki/Via_Dolorosa" title="Via Dolorosa">Via Dolorosa</a>.

At Calvary, Jesus is offered a concoction usually offered as a painkiller. According to Matthew and Mark, he refuses it.</p>
<p>The soldiers then crucify Jesus and <a href="/wiki/Sortes_(ancient_Rome)" title="Sortes (ancient Rome)">cast lots</a> for his clothes. Above Jesus&apos; head on the cross is Pilate&apos;s inscription, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews&quot;; soldiers and passersby <a href="/wiki/Mocking_of_Jesus" title="Mocking of Jesus">mock</a> him about it.

<p>In all four gospels, Mary Magdalene goes to Jesus&apos; tomb on Sunday morning and is surprised to find it empty. Jesus, she learns, has risen from the dead. Despite Jesus&apos; teaching, the disciples had not understood that Jesus would rise again. After the discovery of the empty tomb, Jesus makes a series of appearances to the disciples.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Historical_views">Historical views</span></h2>


<p>Prior to the <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" title="Age of Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>, the gospels were usually regarded as accurate historical accounts, but since then scholars have emerged who question the reliability of the gospels and draw a distinction between the Jesus described in the gospels and the Jesus of history. Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during the quest that applied them. While there is widespread scholarly agreement on the existence of Jesus, and a basic consensus on the general outline of his life, the portraits of Jesus constructed in the quests have often differed from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts.</p>
<p>Approaches to the historical reconstruction of the life of Jesus have varied from the &quot;maximalist&quot; approaches of the 19th century, in which the gospel accounts were accepted as reliable evidence wherever it is possible, to the &quot;minimalist&quot; approaches of the early 20th century, where hardly anything about Jesus was accepted as historical. In the 1950s, as the second quest for the historical Jesus gathered pace, the minimalist approaches faded away, and in the 21st century, minimalists such as Price are a very small minority. Although a belief in the inerrancy of the gospels cannot be supported historically, many scholars since the 1980s have held that, beyond the few facts considered to be historically certain, certain other elements of Jesus&apos; life are &quot;historically probable&quot;. Modern scholarly research on the historical Jesus thus focuses on identifying the most probable elements.</p>

<p>In AD 6, Judea, Idumea, and Samaria were transformed from a client kingdom of the Roman Empire into an imperial province. A Roman prefect, rather than a client king, ruled the land. The prefect ruled from Caesarea, leaving Jerusalem to be run by the high priest. As an exception, the prefect came to Jerusalem during religious festivals, when religious and patriotic enthusiasm sometimes inspired unrest or uprisings. Gentile lands surrounded the Jewish territories of Judea and Galilee, but Roman law and practice allowed Jews to remain separate legally and culturally. Galilee was evidently prosperous, and poverty was limited enough that it did not threaten the social order. Jewish religion was unusual in that Jews acknowledged only one God, they considered themselves chosen by him, and they wanted Gentiles to accept their God as the only God. Jews based their faith and religious practice on the Torah, five books said to have been given by God to Moses. The three prominent religious parties were Pharisees, Essenes, and Sadducees. Together these parties represented only a small fraction of the population. Most Jews looked forward to a time that God would deliver them from their pagan rulers, possibly through war against the Romans.</p>

<p>Historians face a formidable challenge when they analyze the canonical Gospels. The Gospels are not biographies in the modern sense, and the authors explain Jesus&apos; theological significance and recount his public ministry while omitting many details of his life. The supernatural events associated with Jesus&apos; death and resurrection make the challenge even more difficult. Scholars use a number of criteria, such as the <a href="/wiki/Criterion_of_multiple_attestation" title="Criterion of multiple attestation">criterion of multiple attestation</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Biblical_criticism#Coherence" title="Biblical criticism">criterion of coherence</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Criterion_of_discontinuity" class="mw-redirect" title="Criterion of discontinuity">criterion of discontinuity</a> to judge the historicity of events. The historicity of an event also depends on the reliability of the source; indeed, the gospels are not independent nor consistent records of Jesus&apos;s life. Mark, which is most likely the earliest written gospel, has been considered for many decades the most historically accurate. John, the latest written gospel, differs considerably from the Synoptic Gospels, and thus is generally considered less reliable, although more and more scholars now also recognize that it may contain a core of older material as historically valuable as the Synoptic tradition or even more so.</p>
<p>The non-canonical Gospel of Thomas is an independent witness to many of the Jesus&apos; parables and aphorisms. For example, Thomas confirms that Jesus blessed the poor and that this saying circulated independently before being combined with similar sayings in the Q document. Other select non-canonical Christian texts may also have historical value.</p>
<p>Non-Christian sources used to establish the historical existence of Jesus include the works of first-century historians Josephus and <a href="/wiki/Tacitus" title="Tacitus">Tacitus</a>. Josephus scholar <a href="/wiki/Louis_H._Feldman" class="mw-redirect" title="Louis H. Feldman">Louis H. Feldman</a> has stated that &quot;few have doubted the genuineness&quot; of Josephus&apos; reference to Jesus in <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Antiquities_of_the_Jews/Book_XX#Chapter_9" class="extiw" title="s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XX">book 20</a> of the <i><a href="/wiki/Antiquities_of_the_Jews" title="Antiquities of the Jews">Antiquities of the Jews</a></i>, and it is disputed only by a small number of scholars. Tacitus referred to Christ and his execution by Pilate in <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Annals_(Tacitus)/Book_15#44" class="extiw" title="s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15">book 15</a> of his work <i><a href="/wiki/Annals_(Tacitus)" title="Annals (Tacitus)">Annals</a></i>. Scholars generally consider Tacitus&apos;s reference to the execution of Jesus to be both authentic and of historical value as an independent Roman source.</p>
<p>Non-Christian sources are valuable in two ways. First, they show that even neutral or hostile parties never evince any doubt that Jesus actually existed. Second, they present a rough picture of Jesus that is compatible with that found in the Christian sources: that Jesus was a teacher, had a reputation as a miracle worker, had a brother James, and died a violent death.</p>
<p>Archeology helps scholars better understand Jesus&apos; social world. Recent archeological work, for example, indicates that Capernaum, a city important in Jesus&apos; ministry, was poor and small, without even a forum or an <a href="/wiki/Agora" title="Agora">agora</a>. This archaeological discovery resonates well with the scholarly view that Jesus advocated reciprocal sharing among the destitute in that area of Galilee.</p>

<p>The gospels offer several clues concerning the year of Jesus&apos; birth. <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#2:1" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew">Matthew 2:1</a> associates the birth of Jesus with the reign of <a href="/wiki/Herod_the_Great" title="Herod the Great">Herod the Great</a>, who died around 4 BC, and <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#1:5" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke">Luke 1:5</a> mentions that Herod was on the throne shortly before the birth of Jesus, although this gospel also associates the birth with the <a href="/wiki/Census_of_Quirinius" title="Census of Quirinius">Census of Quirinius</a> which took place ten years later. <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#3:23" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke">Luke 3:23</a> states that Jesus was &quot;about thirty years old&quot; at the start of his <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Jesus" title="Ministry of Jesus">ministry</a>, which according to <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Acts#10:37" class="extiw" title="wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts">Acts 10:37&#x2013;38</a> was preceded by John&apos;s ministry, itself recorded in <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#3:1" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke">Luke 3:1&#x2013;2</a> to have begun in the 15th year of <a href="/wiki/Tiberius" title="Tiberius">Tiberius</a>&apos; reign (28 or 29 AD). By collating the gospel accounts with historical data and using various other methods, most scholars arrive at a date of birth between 6 and 4 BC for Jesus, but some propose estimates that lie in a wider range.</p>
<p>The years of Jesus&apos; ministry have been estimated using several different approaches. One of these applies the reference in <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#3:1" class="extiw" title="wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke">Luke 3:1&#x2013;2</a>, <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Acts#10:37" class="extiw" title="wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts">Acts 10:37&#x2013;38</a> and the dates of Tiberius&apos; reign, which are well known, to give a date of around 28&#x2013;29 AD for the start of Jesus&apos; ministry. Another approach uses the statement about the temple in <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/John#2:13" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/John">John 2:13&#x2013;20</a>, which asserts that the <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem_Temple" class="mw-redirect" title="Jerusalem Temple">temple in Jerusalem</a> was in its 46th year of construction at the start of Jesus&apos; ministry, together with <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Antiquities_of_the_Jews/Book_XV" class="extiw" title="wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XV">Josephus&apos; statement</a> that the temple&apos;s reconstruction was started by Herod in the 18th year of his reign, to estimate a date around 27&#x2013;29 AD. A further method uses the date of the <a href="/wiki/Death_of_John_the_Baptist" class="mw-redirect" title="Death of John the Baptist">death of John the Baptist</a> and the marriage of <a href="/wiki/Herod_Antipas" title="Herod Antipas">Herod Antipas</a> to <a href="/wiki/Herodias" title="Herodias">Herodias</a>, based on the writings of Josephus, and correlates it with <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#14:4" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew">Matthew 14:4</a> and <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Mark#6:18" class="extiw" title="wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark">Mark 6:18</a>. Given that most scholars date the marriage of Herod and Herodias as AD 28&#x2013;35, this yields a date about 28&#x2013;29 AD.</p>
<p>A number of approaches have been used to estimate the year of the crucifixion of Jesus. Most scholars agree that he died between 30 and 33 AD. The gospels state that the event occurred during the prefecture of Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea from 26 to 36 AD. The date for the <a href="/wiki/Conversion_of_Paul" class="mw-redirect" title="Conversion of Paul">conversion of Paul</a> (estimated to be 33&#x2013;36 AD) acts as an upper bound for the date of Crucifixion. The dates for Paul&apos;s conversion and ministry can be determined by analyzing Paul&apos;s epistles and the Book of Acts. Astronomers since <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Newton" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a> have tried to estimate the precise date of the Crucifixion by analyzing lunar motion and calculating historic dates of <a href="/wiki/Passover" title="Passover">Passover</a>, a festival based on the <a href="/wiki/Lunisolar_calendar" title="Lunisolar calendar">lunisolar</a> <a href="/wiki/Hebrew_calendar" title="Hebrew calendar">Hebrew calendar</a>. The most widely accepted dates derived from this method are April 7, 30 AD, and April 3, 33 AD (both <a href="/wiki/Julian_calendar" title="Julian calendar">Julian</a>).</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Historians have reached a limited consensus on the basics of Jesus&apos; life.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Family">Family</span></h4>
<p>Jesus was Jewish and born to Mary and Joseph. He grew up in Nazareth in Galilee. Most modern scholars, such as <a href="/wiki/E._P._Sanders" title="E. P. Sanders">E. P. Sanders</a> and <a href="/wiki/G%C3%A9za_Vermes" title="G&#xE9;za Vermes">G&#xE9;za Vermes</a>, generally consider Joseph to be Jesus&apos; father. They say that the doctrine of Jesus&apos; virgin birth arose from theological development rather than from historical events. Other scholars take it as significant that the virgin birth is attested by two separate gospels though the details of each vary. In this view, <a href="/wiki/F._Dale_Bruner" title="F. Dale Bruner">F. Dale Bruner</a> says that the virgin conception and birth constitute a tradition that fits within the <a href="/wiki/Criterion_of_multiple_attestation" title="Criterion of multiple attestation">criterion of multiple attestation</a> since the accounts of Matthew and Luke are taken as two independent testimonies of the tradition.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Baptism_and_John_the_Baptist">Baptism and John the Baptist</span></h4>
<p>Most modern scholars consider Jesus&apos; baptism to be a definite historical fact, along with his crucifixion. James D.G. Dunn states that they &quot;command almost universal assent&quot; and &quot;rank so high on the &apos;almost impossible to doubt or deny&apos; scale of historical facts&quot; that they are often the starting points for the study of the historical Jesus. Scholars adduce the <a href="/wiki/Criterion_of_embarrassment" title="Criterion of embarrassment">criterion of embarrassment</a>, saying that early Christians would not have invented a baptism that might imply that Jesus committed sins and wanted to repent.</p>
<p>John&apos;s ministry was one of many renewal movements that sought to strengthen Judaism against the pressure of Hellenistic influence. His movement was unusual in that it opposed the Jewish leadership rather than the Roman occupiers. He was the first of many 1st-century prophets who raised hopes for divine intervention. Jesus was inspired by John and took over from him many elements of his teaching. Jesus&apos; teaching, however, emphasized grace and forgiveness over judgment.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Ministry_in_Galilee">Ministry in Galilee</span></h4>
<p>Most scholars hold that Jesus lived in Galilee and Judea and did not preach or study elsewhere. They agree that Jesus debated with Jewish authorities on the subject of God, performed some healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. His parables about the Kingdom of God used striking and original imagery, such as likening it to a tiny mustard seed or to leaven. While Jesus&apos; miracles fit within the social context of antiquity, he defined them differently, First, he attributed them to the faith of those healed. Second, he connected them to end times prophecy. Jesus&apos; healings were long considered literally true and sometimes dismissed as fraudulent, but today an understanding of psychosomatic therapy leads more people to believe that faith healing could be possible. The Jewish critics considered Jesus&apos; ministry to be scandalous because he feasted with sinners, fraternized with women, and allowed his followers to pluck grain on the Sabbath.</p>
<p>Jesus was an exorcist, as demonstrated by <a href="/wiki/Graham_H._Twelftree" class="mw-redirect" title="Graham H. Twelftree">Graham H. Twelftree</a>. The stories of Jesus exorcising demons occur only in the earliest traditions and were not added by later writers.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Role">Role</span></h4>
<p>Jesus taught that an apocalyptic figure, the &quot;Son of Man,&quot; would soon come on clouds of glory to gather the elect, or chosen ones (Mark 13:24-27, Matthew 24:29-31, Luke 21:25-28). He referred to himself as a &quot;<a href="/wiki/Son_of_man" title="Son of man">son of man</a>&quot; in the colloquial sense of &quot;a person,&quot; but historians don&apos;t know whether he also meant himself when he referred to the heavenly &quot;Son of Man.&quot; Paul and other early Christians interpreted the &quot;Son of Man&quot; as the risen Jesus.</p>
<p>The title Christ, or Messiah, indicates that Jesus&apos; followers believed him to be the anointed heir of King David, whom some Jews expected to save Israel. The Gospels refer to him not only as a Messiah but in the absolute form as &quot;the Messiah&quot; or, equivalently, &quot;the Christ.&quot; In early Judaism, this absolute form of the title is not found, but only phrases such as &quot;his Messiah&quot;. The tradition is ambiguous enough to leave room for debate as to whether Jesus defined his eschatological role as that of the Messiah. The Jewish messianic tradition included many different forms, some of them focused on a Messiah figure and others not. Based on the Christian tradition, <a href="/wiki/Gerd_Theissen" title="Gerd Theissen">Gerd Theissen</a> advances the hypothesis that Jesus saw himself in messianic terms but did not claim the title &quot;Messiah.&quot; Bart Ehrman argues that Jesus did consider himself to be the Messiah, albeit in the sense that he would be the king of the new political order that God would usher in, not in the sense that most people today think of the term.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Crucifixion">Crucifixion</span></h4>
<p>Most scholars consider Jesus&apos; crucifixion to be factual because early Christians would not have invented the painful death of their leader. It is more likely that the Sadducean high-priestly leaders of the Temple had Jesus executed for political reasons than for his teaching. They may have regarded him as a threat to stability, especially after he caused a disturbance at the Temple. Other factors, such as Jesus&apos; entry into Jerusalem, may have contributed to this decision. Pilate most likely saw Jesus&apos; reference to the Kingdom of God as a threat to Roman authority and worked with the Temple elites to have Jesus executed.</p>

The Resurrection of Christ from a 16th-century copy of <i>La Passion de Nostre Seigneur</i></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>After Jesus&apos; death, his followers said he rose from the dead, although exact details of their experiences are unclear. The earliest written reference to <a href="/wiki/Jesus%27_resurrection" class="mw-redirect" title="Jesus&apos; resurrection">Jesus&apos; resurrection</a> is in <a href="/wiki/1_Corinthians_15" title="1 Corinthians 15">1 Corinthians 15</a>, written in the mid-50s AD. Paul&apos;s letter to the Romans begins with a few lines that have the earmarks of being a pre-Pauline creed. They refer to Jesus&apos; resurrection, and this poetic statement may date back to as early as the 30s.</p>
<p>Some of those who claimed to have witnessed Jesus&apos; resurrection later died for their belief. According to <a href="/wiki/E._P._Sanders" title="E. P. Sanders">E. P. Sanders</a>, the Gospel reports contradict each other, which, according to him, suggests competition among those claiming to have seen him first rather than deliberate fraud. On the other hand, <a href="/wiki/L._Michael_White" title="L. Michael White">L. Michael White</a> suggests that inconsistencies in the Gospels reflect differences in the agendas of their unknown authors. The followers of Jesus formed a community to wait for his return and the founding of his kingdom.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Portraits_of_Jesus">Portraits of Jesus</span></h3>

<p>Modern research on the historical Jesus has not led to a unified picture of the historical figure, partly because of the variety of academic traditions represented by the scholars. Given the scarcity of historical sources, it is generally difficult for any scholar to construct a portrait of Jesus that can be considered historically valid beyond the basic elements of his life. The portraits of Jesus constructed in these quests often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospels.</p>
<p>Contemporary scholarship, representing the &quot;third quest,&quot; places Jesus firmly in the Jewish tradition. Leading scholars in the &quot;third quest&quot; include <a href="/wiki/E._P._Sanders" title="E. P. Sanders">E. P. Sanders</a>, <a href="/wiki/Geza_Vermes" class="mw-redirect" title="Geza Vermes">Geza Vermes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gerd_Theissen" title="Gerd Theissen">Gerd Theissen</a>, Christoph Burchard, and <a href="/wiki/John_Dominic_Crossan" title="John Dominic Crossan">John Dominic Crossan</a>. Jesus is seen as the founder of, in the words of E. P. Sanders, a &apos;&quot;renewal movement within Judaism.&quot; This scholarship suggests a continuity between Jesus&apos; life as a wandering charismatic and the same lifestyle carried forward by followers after his death. The main criterion used to discern historical details in the &quot;third quest&quot; is the criterion of plausibility, relative to Jesus&apos; Jewish context and to his influence on Christianity. The main disagreement in contemporary research is whether Jesus was apocalyptic. Most scholars conclude that he was an apocalyptic preacher, like John the Baptist and the apostle Paul. In contrast, certain prominent North American scholars, such as <a href="/wiki/Burton_Mack" class="mw-redirect" title="Burton Mack">Burton Mack</a> and John Dominic Crossan, advocate for a non-eschatological Jesus, one who is more of a <a href="/wiki/Cynicism_(philosophy)" title="Cynicism (philosophy)">Cynic</a> sage than an apocalyptic preacher. In addition to portraying Jesus as an <a href="/wiki/Apocalypticism" title="Apocalypticism">apocalyptic prophet</a>, a charismatic healer or a <a href="/wiki/Cynicism_(philosophy)" title="Cynicism (philosophy)">cynic philosopher</a>, some scholars portray him as the true Messiah or an egalitarian prophet of social change. However, the attributes described in the portraits sometimes overlap, and scholars who differ on some attributes sometimes agree on others.</p>
<p>Since the 18th century, scholars have occasionally put forth that Jesus was a political national messiah, but the evidence for this portrait is negligible. Likewise, the proposal that Jesus was a Zealot does not fit with the earliest strata of the Synoptic tradition.</p>

The representation of the ethnicity of Jesus has been influenced by cultural settings.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Jesus grew up in Galilee and much of his ministry took place there. The languages spoken in Galilee and Judea during the first century AD include <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Palestinian_Aramaic" title="Jewish Palestinian Aramaic">Jewish Palestinian Aramaic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hebrew" class="mw-redirect" title="Hebrew">Hebrew</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Koine_Greek" title="Koine Greek">Greek</a>, with Aramaic being predominant.

<p>Modern scholars agree that Jesus was a Jew of first-century <a href="/wiki/Palestine_(region)" title="Palestine (region)">Palestine</a>. <i><a href="/wiki/Ioudaios" title="Ioudaios">Ioudaios</a></i> in New Testament Greek is a term which in the contemporary context may refer to religion (<a href="/wiki/Second_Temple_Judaism" title="Second Temple Judaism">Second Temple Judaism</a>), ethnicity (of Judea), or both. In a review of the state of modern scholarship, <a href="/wiki/Amy-Jill_Levine" title="Amy-Jill Levine">Amy-Jill Levine</a> writes that the entire question of ethnicity is &quot;fraught with difficulty,&quot; and that &quot;beyond recognizing that &apos;Jesus was Jewish&apos;, rarely does the scholarship address what being &apos;Jewish&apos; means&quot;.</p>
<p>The New Testament gives no description of the physical appearance of Jesus before his death&#x2014;it is generally indifferent to racial appearances and does not refer to the features of the people it mentions. Jesus probably looked like a typical Jew of his time and according to some scholars was likely to have had a sinewy appearance due to <a href="/wiki/Homelessness_of_Jesus" title="Homelessness of Jesus">his ascetic and itinerant lifestyle</a>.</p>

<p>Jesus is the central figure of Christianity. Although Christian views of Jesus vary, it is possible to summarize the key beliefs shared among major denominations, as stated in their <a href="/wiki/Catechism" title="Catechism">catechetical</a> or <a href="/wiki/Confessionalism_(religion)" title="Confessionalism (religion)">confessional</a> texts. Christian views of Jesus are derived from various sources, including the canonical gospels and New Testament letters such as the Pauline epistles and the <a href="/wiki/Johannine_writings" class="mw-redirect" title="Johannine writings">Johannine writings</a>. These documents outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his divinity, humanity, and earthly life, and that he is the Christ and the <a href="/wiki/Son_of_God_(Christianity)" title="Son of God (Christianity)">Son of God</a>. Despite their many shared beliefs, not all Christian denominations agree on all doctrines, and both <a href="/wiki/East%E2%80%93West_Schism" title="East&#x2013;West Schism">major and minor differences</a> on teachings and beliefs have persisted throughout Christianity for centuries.</p>
<p>The New Testament states that the resurrection of Jesus is the foundation of the Christian faith (<a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/1_Corinthians#15:12" class="extiw" title="s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians">1 Corinthians 15:12&#x2013;20</a>).

Jesus is thus seen as the <a href="/wiki/New_Adam" class="mw-redirect" title="New Adam">new and last Adam</a>, whose obedience contrasts with <a href="/wiki/Fall_of_man" title="Fall of man">Adam&apos;s disobedience</a>. Christians view Jesus as a role model, whose God-focused life believers are encouraged to imitate.</p>
<p>Most Christians believe that Jesus was both human and the Son of God. While there has been <a href="/wiki/Christological_controversies" class="mw-redirect" title="Christological controversies">theological debate</a> over his nature, Some early Christians viewed Jesus as subordinate to the Father, and others considered him an aspect of the Father rather than a separate person. The Church resolved the issues in ancient councils, which established the Holy Trinity, with Jesus both fully human and fully God. Trinitarian Christians generally believe that Jesus is the Logos, God&apos;s incarnation and <a href="/wiki/God_the_Son" title="God the Son">God the Son</a>, both fully divine and fully human. However, the doctrine of the Trinity is not universally accepted among Christians. With the Protestant Reformation, Christians such as <a href="/wiki/Michael_Servetus" title="Michael Servetus">Michael Servetus</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Socinian" class="mw-redirect" title="Socinian">Socinians</a> started questioning the ancient creeds that had established Jesus&apos; two natures. Nontrinitarian Christian groups include <a href="/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>, <a href="/wiki/Unitarianism" title="Unitarianism">Unitarians</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witness" class="mw-redirect" title="Jehovah&apos;s Witness">Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses</a>.</p>
<p>Christians revere not only Jesus himself, but also his <a href="/wiki/Name_of_Jesus" class="mw-redirect" title="Name of Jesus">name</a>. Devotions to the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Name_of_Jesus" title="Holy Name of Jesus">Holy Name of Jesus</a> go back to the earliest days of Christianity. These devotions and feasts exist in both <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Christianity" title="Eastern Christianity">Eastern</a> and <a href="/wiki/Western_Church" class="mw-redirect" title="Western Church">Western Christianity</a>.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, Protestant groups became sharply divided in terms of how much they support historical and critical inquiry into the person of Jesus. Protestant denominations allow some such investigation but differ in how far the investigation may go. The Roman Catholic Church drew definite limits, and Catholic scholars have engaged in considerable critical study within those limits.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Jewish">Jewish</span></h3>


<p><a href="/wiki/Judaism" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> rejects the idea of Jesus being God, or a mediator to God, or part of a Trinity. It holds that Jesus is not the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Messianism" class="mw-redirect" title="Jewish Messianism">Messiah</a>, arguing that he neither fulfilled the <a href="/wiki/Messianic_prophecies" class="mw-redirect" title="Messianic prophecies">Messianic prophecies</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Tanakh" title="Tanakh">Tanakh</a> nor embodied the personal qualifications of the Messiah. According to Jewish tradition, there were no prophets after <a href="/wiki/Malachi" title="Malachi">Malachi</a>, who delivered his prophesies in the fifth century BC. Although currently disputed, <a href="/wiki/David_Flusser" title="David Flusser">David Flusser</a> offers the Pharisee, Joshua b. Perahyah, as a possible rabbi of Jesus, but likens his social outlook to that of the Essenes and his prophetic stance to that of John the Baptist.</p>
<p>Judaic criticism of Jesus is long-standing. The Talmud, written and compiled from the third to the fifth century AD, includes <a href="/wiki/Jesus_in_the_Talmud" title="Jesus in the Talmud">stories</a> that since medieval times have been considered to be defamatory accounts of Jesus. In one such story, <i>Yeshu ha-nozri</i> (&quot;Jesus the Christian&quot;), a lewd apostate, is executed by the Jewish high court for spreading idolatry and practicing magic. The majority of contemporary historians consider that this material provides no information on the historical Jesus. The <i><a href="/wiki/Mishneh_Torah" title="Mishneh Torah">Mishneh Torah</a></i>, a late 12th-century work of <a href="/wiki/Halakha" title="Halakha">Jewish law</a> written by <a href="/wiki/Moses_Maimonides" class="mw-redirect" title="Moses Maimonides">Moses Maimonides</a>, states that Jesus is a &quot;stumbling block&quot; who makes &quot;the majority of the world to err and serve a god other than the Lord&quot;.</p>

<p>A major figure in Islam, Jesus (commonly transliterated as <i>&#x2BE;&#x12A;s&#x101;</i>) is considered to be a <a href="/wiki/Apostle_(Islam)" class="mw-redirect" title="Apostle (Islam)">messenger</a> of <a href="/wiki/God_in_Islam" title="God in Islam">God</a> (<i><a href="/wiki/Allah" title="Allah">Allah</a></i>) and the Messiah (<i><a href="/wiki/Messiah#Islam" title="Messiah">al-Masih</a></i>) who was sent to guide the <a href="/wiki/Israelites" title="Israelites">Children of Israel</a> (<i>Bani Isra&apos;il</i>) with a new scripture, the Gospel (referred to in Islam as <i><a href="/wiki/Gospel_in_Islam" title="Gospel in Islam">Injil</a></i>). Muslims regard the gospels of the New Testament as inauthentic, and believe that Jesus&apos; original message was <a href="/wiki/Tahrif" title="Tahrif">lost or altered</a> and that <a href="/wiki/Muhammad_in_Islam" title="Muhammad in Islam">Muhammad</a> came later to restore it. Belief in Jesus (and all other <a href="/wiki/Prophets_in_Islam" class="mw-redirect" title="Prophets in Islam">messengers of God</a>) is a requirement for being a <a href="/wiki/Muslim" title="Muslim">Muslim</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Jesus_in_Islam" title="Jesus in Islam">Quran mentions Jesus</a> by name 25 times&#x2014;more often than Muhammad&#x2014;and emphasizes that Jesus was a mortal human who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God&apos;s message. While the Qur&apos;an acknowledges the Virgin birth of Jesus, He is considered to be neither the incarnation nor the <a href="/wiki/Son_of_God_(Christianity)" title="Son of God (Christianity)">son of God</a>. Islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of <a href="/wiki/Monotheism" title="Monotheism">monotheism</a> (<i><a href="/wiki/Tawhid" title="Tawhid">tawhid</a></i>) and forbid the association of partners with God, which would be <a href="/wiki/Shirk_(Islam)" title="Shirk (Islam)">idolatry</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Quran" title="Quran">Quran</a> says that Jesus himself never claimed divinity, and predicts that at the <a href="/wiki/Islamic_view_of_the_Last_Judgment" class="mw-redirect" title="Islamic view of the Last Judgment">Last Judgment</a>, Jesus will deny having ever made such a claim (Quran 5:116). Like all <a href="/wiki/Prophets_in_Islam" class="mw-redirect" title="Prophets in Islam">prophets in Islam</a>, Jesus is considered a Muslim.</p>
<p>The Quran describes the annunciation to Mary (<i><a href="/wiki/Mary_in_Islam" title="Mary in Islam">Maryam</a></i>) by an angel that she is to give birth to Jesus while remaining a virgin. It calls the virgin birth a miracle that occurred by the will of God. The Quran (21:91 and 66:12) states that God breathed <a href="/wiki/Holy_Spirit_(Islam)" title="Holy Spirit (Islam)">his spirit</a> into Mary while she was chaste. Jesus is called the &quot;Spirit of God&quot; because he was born through the action of the Spirit, but that belief does not imply <a href="/wiki/Pre-existence_of_Christ" title="Pre-existence of Christ">his pre-existence</a>.</p>
<p>To aid in his ministry to the Jewish people, Jesus was given the ability to perform <a href="/wiki/Miracle" title="Miracle">miracles</a>, by permission of God rather than by his own power. Through his ministry, Jesus is seen as a <a href="/wiki/Precursor_(religion)" title="Precursor (religion)">precursor</a> to Muhammad. According to the Quran, Jesus was not crucified but was merely made to appear that way to unbelievers by Allah, who physically raised Jesus into the heavens. To Muslims, it is the ascension rather than the crucifixion that constitutes a major event in the life of Jesus. Most Muslims believe that Jesus will return to earth at the <a href="/wiki/End_time#Islam" title="End time">end of time</a> and defeat the <a href="/wiki/Antichrist" title="Antichrist">Antichrist</a> (<i><a href="/wiki/Masih_ad-Dajjal" class="mw-redirect" title="Masih ad-Dajjal">ad-Dajjal</a></i>) by killing him in Lud.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Ahmadiyya" title="Ahmadiyya">Ahmadiyya Muslim Community</a> has several <a href="/wiki/Jesus_in_Ahmadiyya_Islam" title="Jesus in Ahmadiyya Islam">distinct teachings</a> about Jesus. Ahmadis believe that he was a mortal man who survived his crucifixion and died a natural death at the age of 120 in <a href="/wiki/Kashmir" title="Kashmir">Kashmir</a>, India.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith" title="Bah&#xE1;&apos;&#xED; Faith">Bah&#xE1;&apos;&#xED;</a> teachings consider Jesus to be a <a href="/wiki/Manifestation_of_God" title="Manifestation of God">manifestation of God</a>, a Bah&#xE1;&apos;&#xED; concept for prophets&#x2014;intermediaries between God and humanity, serving as messengers and reflecting God&apos;s qualities and attributes. The Bah&#xE1;&apos;&#xED; concept emphasizes the simultaneous qualities of humanity and divinity; thus, it is similar to the Christian concept of incarnation. Bah&#xE1;&apos;&#xED; thought accepts Jesus as the Son of God. In Bah&#xE1;&apos;&#xED; thought, Jesus was a perfect incarnation of God&apos;s attributes, but Bah&#xE1;&apos;&#xED; teachings reject the idea that &quot;ineffable essence&quot; of the Divinity was contained within a single human body because of their beliefs regarding &quot;<a href="/wiki/Omnipresence" title="Omnipresence">omnipresence</a> and <a href="/wiki/Transcendence_(religion)#Bah.C3.A1.27.C3.AD_Faith" title="Transcendence (religion)">transcendence</a> of the essence of God&quot;.</p>

Bah&#xE1;&apos;&#xED;s believe that God&apos;s plan unfolds gradually through this process as mankind matures, and that some of the manifestations arrive in specific fulfillment of the missions of previous ones. Thus, Bah&#xE1;&apos;&#xED;s believe that Bah&#xE1;&apos;u&apos;ll&#xE1;h is the promised return of Christ. Bah&#xE1;&apos;&#xED; teachings confirm many, but not all, aspects of Jesus as portrayed in the gospels. Bah&#xE1;&apos;&#xED;s believe in the virgin birth and in the Crucifixion, but see the Resurrection and the miracles of Jesus as symbolic.</p>

<p>In Christian Gnosticism (now a largely extinct religious movement), Jesus was sent from the divine realm and provided the secret knowledge (<a href="/wiki/Gnosis" title="Gnosis">gnosis</a>) necessary for salvation. Most Gnostics believed that Jesus was a human who became possessed by the spirit of &quot;the Christ&quot; at his baptism. This spirit left Jesus&apos; body during the crucifixion, but was rejoined to him when he was raised from the dead. Some Gnostics, however, were <a href="/wiki/Docetism" title="Docetism">docetics</a>, believed that Jesus did not have a physical body, but only appeared to possess one. <a href="/wiki/Manichaeism" title="Manichaeism">Manichaeism</a>, a Gnostic sect, accepted Jesus as a prophet, in addition to revering <a href="/wiki/Gautama_Buddha" title="Gautama Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a> and <a href="/wiki/Zoroaster" title="Zoroaster">Zoroaster</a>.</p>
<p>Some <a href="/wiki/Hinduism" title="Hinduism">Hindus</a> consider Jesus to be an <a href="/wiki/Avatar" title="Avatar">avatar</a> or a <a href="/wiki/Sadhu" title="Sadhu">sadhu</a> and point out similarities between <a href="/wiki/Krishna" title="Krishna">Krishna</a> and Jesus&apos; teachings. <a href="/wiki/Paramahansa_Yogananda" title="Paramahansa Yogananda">Paramahansa Yogananda</a>, an Indian <a href="/wiki/Guru" title="Guru">guru</a>, taught that Jesus was the reincarnation of <a href="/wiki/Elisha" title="Elisha">Elisha</a> and a student of <a href="/wiki/John_the_Baptist" title="John the Baptist">John the Baptist</a>, the reincarnation of <a href="/wiki/Elijah" title="Elijah">Elijah</a>.

Disciples of the <a href="/wiki/Cao_%C4%90%C3%A0i" title="Cao &#x110;&#xE0;i">Cao &#x110;&#xE0;i</a> religion worship Jesus Christ as a major religious teacher. He is revealed during communication with Divine Beings as the spirit of their Supreme Being (God the Father) together with other major religious teachers and founders like the Gautama Buddha, <a href="/wiki/Laozi" title="Laozi">Laozi</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Confucius" title="Confucius">Confucius</a>. The <a href="/wiki/New_Age" title="New Age">New Age</a> movement entertains a wide variety of views on Jesus. <a href="/wiki/Theosophy" title="Theosophy">Theosophists</a>, from whom many New Age teachings originated, refer to Jesus as the <a href="/wiki/Master_Jesus" title="Master Jesus">Master Jesus</a> and believe that Christ, after <a href="/wiki/Reincarnation" title="Reincarnation">various incarnations</a>, occupied the body of Jesus. <a href="/wiki/Jesus_in_Scientology" title="Jesus in Scientology">Scientologists recognize</a> Jesus (along with other religious figures such as Zoroaster, <a href="/wiki/Muhammad" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>, and Buddha) as part of their &quot;religious heritage&quot;. <a href="/wiki/Atheist" class="mw-redirect" title="Atheist">Atheists</a> reject Jesus&apos; divinity, but not all hold a negative estimation of him; <a href="/wiki/Richard_Dawkins" title="Richard Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a>, for instance, refers to Jesus as &quot;a great moral teacher&quot;, while stating in his book <i><a href="/wiki/The_God_Delusion" title="The God Delusion">The God Delusion</a></i> that Jesus is praiseworthy because he did not derive his ethics from biblical scripture.</p>
<p>Jesus had detractors, both past and present, as well. Early critics of Jesus and Christianity included <a href="/wiki/Celsus" title="Celsus">Celsus</a> in the second century and <a href="/wiki/Porphyry_(philosopher)" title="Porphyry (philosopher)">Porphyry</a> in the third.

Other notable modern critics of Jesus include <a href="/wiki/Sita_Ram_Goel" title="Sita Ram Goel">Sita Ram Goel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens" title="Christopher Hitchens">Christopher Hitchens</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bertrand_Russell" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Dayananda_Saraswati" title="Dayananda Saraswati">Dayananda Saraswati</a>.

Russell called Jesus&#x2019; vindictive nature a defect in his moral character in that Jesus in the Gospels believed in the everlasting punishment of hell, which Russell felt that no one who is &quot;really profoundly humane can believe in&quot;. Russell also notes a repeated &quot;vindictive fury against those people who would not listen to His preaching&quot; which he felt &quot;detract[s] from superlative excellence&quot;.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Some of the earliest depictions of Jesus at the <a href="/wiki/Dura-Europos_church" title="Dura-Europos church">Dura-Europos church</a> are firmly dated to before 256. Thereafter, despite the lack of biblical references or historical records, a wide range of depictions of Jesus appeared during the last two millennia, often influenced by cultural settings, political circumstances and theological contexts. As in other <a href="/wiki/Early_Christian_art" class="mw-redirect" title="Early Christian art">Early Christian art</a>, the earliest depictions date to the late second or early third century, and surviving images are found especially in the <a href="/wiki/Catacombs_of_Rome" title="Catacombs of Rome">Catacombs of Rome</a>.</p>
<p>The depiction of Christ in pictorial form was highly <a href="/wiki/Aniconism_in_Christianity" title="Aniconism in Christianity">controversial</a> in the early church. From the 5th century onward, flat painted icons became popular in the Eastern Church. The <a href="/wiki/Byzantine_Iconoclasm" title="Byzantine Iconoclasm">Byzantine Iconoclasm</a> acted as a barrier to developments in the East, but by the ninth century, art was permitted again. The <a href="/wiki/Transfiguration_of_Jesus_in_Christian_art" title="Transfiguration of Jesus in Christian art">Transfiguration</a> was a major theme in Eastern Christian art, and every <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox" class="mw-redirect" title="Eastern Orthodox">Eastern Orthodox</a> monk who had trained in <a href="/wiki/Icon" title="Icon">icon</a> painting had to prove his craft by painting an icon depicting it. Icons receive the external marks of veneration, such as kisses and prostration, and they are thought to be powerful channels of divine grace.</p>
<p>Before the Protestant Reformation, the <a href="/wiki/Crucifix" title="Crucifix">crucifix</a> was common in Western Christianity. It is a model of the cross with Jesus crucified on it. The crucifix became the central ornament of the altar in the 13th century, a use that has been nearly universal in Roman Catholic churches until recent times.</p>
<p>Jesus appears as an infant in a manger (feed trough) in Christmas creches, which depict the Nativity scene. He is typically joined by Mary, Joseph, animals, shepherds, angels, and the Magi. <a href="/wiki/Francis_of_Assisi" title="Francis of Assisi">Francis of Assisi</a> (1181/82&#x2013;1226) is credited with popularizing the creche, although he probably did not initiate it. The creche reached its height of popularity in the 17th and 18th centuries in southern Europe.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> brought forth a number of artists who focused on depictions of Jesus; <a href="/wiki/Fra_Angelico" title="Fra Angelico">Fra Angelico</a> and others followed <a href="/wiki/Giotto" title="Giotto">Giotto</a> in the systematic development of uncluttered images.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Protestant_Reformation" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> brought renewed <a href="/wiki/Aniconism_in_Christianity" title="Aniconism in Christianity">resistance to imagery</a>, but total prohibition was atypical, and Protestant objections to images have tended to reduce since the 16th century. Although large images are generally avoided, few Protestants now object to book illustrations depicting Jesus. The use of depictions of Jesus is advocated by the leaders of denominations such as <a href="/wiki/Anglicans" class="mw-redirect" title="Anglicans">Anglicans</a> and Catholics and is a key element of the Eastern Orthodox tradition.</p>

<p>The total destruction that ensued with the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_(70)" class="mw-redirect" title="Siege of Jerusalem (70)">siege of Jerusalem</a> by the Romans in AD 70 made the survival of items from first century Judea very rare and almost no direct records survive about the history of Judaism from the last part of the first century through the second century. <a href="/wiki/Margaret_M._Mitchell" title="Margaret M.

However, throughout the history of Christianity a number of <a href="/wiki/Relic" title="Relic">relics</a> attributed to Jesus have been claimed, although doubt has been cast on them. The 16th-century Catholic theologian <a href="/wiki/Erasmus" class="mw-redirect" title="Erasmus">Erasmus</a> wrote sarcastically about the proliferation of relics and the number of buildings that could have been constructed from the wood claimed to be from the <a href="/wiki/True_Cross" title="True Cross">cross used in the Crucifixion</a>.
