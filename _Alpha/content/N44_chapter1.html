<p><b>War</b> is a state of armed conflict between societies. It is generally characterized by extreme collective aggression, destruction, and usually high mortality.

The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">Second World War</a>, from 1939 to 1945, with 60&#x2013;85 million deaths, followed by the <a href="/wiki/Mongol_conquests" class="mw-redirect" title="Mongol conquests">Mongol conquests</a> which was greater than 41 million. Proportionally speaking, the most destructive war in modern history is the <a href="/wiki/Paraguayan_War" title="Paraguayan War">War of the Triple Alliance</a>, which took the lives of over 60% of <a href="/wiki/Paraguay" title="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>&apos;s population, according to <a href="/wiki/Steven_Pinker" title="Steven Pinker">Steven Pinker</a>. In 2003, <a href="/wiki/Richard_Smalley" title="Richard Smalley">Richard Smalley</a> identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problem facing <a href="/wiki/Human" title="Human">humanity</a> for the next fifty years. War usually results in significant deterioration of infrastructure and the ecosystem, a decrease in social spending, <a href="/wiki/Famine" title="Famine">famine</a>, large-scale emigration from the war zone, and often the mistreatment of <a href="/wiki/Prisoner_of_war" title="Prisoner of war">prisoners of war</a> or <a href="/wiki/Civilians" class="mw-redirect" title="Civilians">civilians</a>.

In some circumstances, troops may engage in <a href="/wiki/Genocide" title="Genocide">genocide</a>, <a href="/wiki/War_rape" class="mw-redirect" title="War rape">war rape</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing" title="Ethnic cleansing">ethnic cleansing</a>. Commonly, however, the conduct of troops may be limited to posturing and sham attacks, leading to highly rule-bound and often largely symbolic combat in which casualties are much reduced from that which would be expected if soldiers were genuinely violent towards the enemy. Situations of deliberate dampening of hostilities occurred in World War I by some accounts, e.g., a volley of gunfire being exchanged after a misplaced mortar hit the British line, after which a German soldier shouted an apology to British forces, effectively stopping a hostile exchange of gunfire. Other examples of non-aggression, also from World War I, are detailed in <i><a href="/wiki/Good-Bye_to_All_That" title="Good-Bye to All That">Good-Bye to All That</a></i>. These include spontaneous ceasefires to rebuild defences and retrieve casualties, alongside behaviour such as refusing to shoot at enemy during ablutions and the taking of great risks (described as 1 in 20) to retrieve enemy wounded from the battlefield. The most notable spontaneous ceasefire of World War I was the <a href="/wiki/Christmas_truce" title="Christmas truce">Christmas truce</a>.</p><p>The psychological separation between combatants, and the destructive power of modern weaponry, may act to override this effect and facilitate participation by combatants in the mass slaughter of combatants or civilians. The unusual circumstances of warfare can incite apparently normal individuals to commit atrocities. Sociologists and historians often view <a href="/wiki/Dehumanization" title="Dehumanization">dehumanization</a> as central to war.</p><p>The earliest recorded evidence of war belongs to the Mesolithic cemetery <a href="/wiki/Site_117" class="mw-redirect" title="Site 117">Site 117</a>, which has been determined to be approximately 14,000 years old. About forty-five percent of the skeletons there displayed signs of violent death. Since the rise of the <a href="/wiki/State_(polity)" title="State (polity)">state</a> some 5,000 years ago, military activity has occurred over much of the globe. The advent of <a href="/wiki/Gunpowder" title="Gunpowder">gunpowder</a> and the acceleration of technological advances led to modern warfare. According to Conway W. Henderson, &quot;One source claims that 14,500 wars have taken place between 3500 BC and the late 20th century, costing 3.5 billion lives, leaving only 300 years of peace (Beer 1981: 20).&quot;</p><p>In <i><a href="/wiki/War_Before_Civilization" title="War Before Civilization">War Before Civilization</a></i>, Lawrence H. Keeley, a professor at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana%E2%80%93Champaign" title="University of Illinois at Urbana&#x2013;Champaign">University of Illinois</a>, says that approximately 90&#x2013;95% of known societies throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare, and many fought constantly.</p><p>Keeley describes several styles of primitive combat such as small raids, large raids, and massacres. All of these forms of warfare were used by primitive societies, a finding supported by other researchers. Keeley explains that early war raids were not well organized, as the participants did not have any formal training. Scarcity of resources meant that defensive works were not a cost effective way to protect the society against enemy raids.</p><p><a href="/wiki/William_Rubinstein" title="William Rubinstein">William Rubinstein</a> wrote that &quot;Pre-literate societies, even those organised in a relatively advanced way, were renowned for their studied cruelty ... &apos;archaeology yields evidence of prehistoric massacres more severe than any recounted in ethnography [i.e., after the coming of the Europeans]&apos;. At <a href="/wiki/Crow_Creek_massacre" title="Crow Creek massacre">Crow Creek</a>, South Dakota, as noted, archaeologists found a <a href="/wiki/Mass_grave" title="Mass grave">mass grave</a> of &apos;more than 500 men, women, and children who had been slaughtered, scalped, and mutilated during an attack on their village a century and a half before Columbus&apos;s arrival (ca. AD 1325)&apos; &quot;.</p><p>It is problematic, however, to make generalizations regarding prehistoric violence, because the frequency and manifestation of warfare vary greatly in the ethnographic and archaeological record.</p><p>In Western Europe, since the late 18th century, more than 150 conflicts and about 600 battles have taken place. During the 20th century, war resulted in a dramatic intensification of the pace of social changes, and was a crucial catalyst for the emergence of the Left as a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>Recent rapid increases in the technologies of war, and therefore in its destructiveness (see <a href="/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction" title="Mutual assured destruction">mutual assured destruction</a>), have caused widespread public concern, and have in all probability forestalled, and may altogether prevent the outbreak of a nuclear World War III. At the end of each of the last two World Wars, concerted and popular efforts were made to come to a greater understanding of the underlying dynamics of war and to thereby hopefully reduce or even eliminate it altogether. These efforts materialized in the forms of the <a href="/wiki/League_of_Nations" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a>, and its successor, the United Nations.</p><p>Shortly after <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, as a token of support for this concept, most nations joined the United Nations. During this same post-war period, with the aim of further delegitimizing war as an acceptable and logical extension of foreign policy, most national governments also renamed their Ministries or Departments of War as their Ministries or Departments of Defense, for example, the former U.S. Department of War was renamed as the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Defense" class="mw-redirect" title="U.S. Department of Defense">U.S. Department of Defense</a>.</p><p>In 1947, in view of the rapidly increasingly destructive consequences of modern warfare, and with a particular concern for the consequences and costs of the newly developed <a href="/wiki/Atom_bomb" class="mw-redirect" title="Atom bomb">atom bomb</a>, <a href="/wiki/Albert_Einstein" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> famously stated, &quot;I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.&quot;</p><p><a href="/wiki/Mao_Zedong" title="Mao Zedong">Mao Zedong</a> urged the socialist camp not to fear nuclear war with the United States since, even if &quot;half of mankind died, the other half would remain while imperialism would be razed to the ground and the whole world would become socialist.&quot;</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Human_Security_Report_2005" title="Human Security Report 2005">Human Security Report 2005</a> documented a significant decline in the number and severity of armed conflicts since the end of the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> in the early 1990s. However, the evidence examined in the 2008 edition of the Center for International Development and Conflict Management&apos;s &quot;Peace and Conflict&quot; study indicated that the overall decline in conflicts had stalled.</p><p>Three of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been waged in the last century. These are the two World Wars, followed by the <a href="/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War" title="Second Sino-Japanese War">Second Sino-Japanese War</a> (which is sometimes considered part of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, or overlapping with that war). Most of the others involved China or neighboring peoples. The death toll of World War II, being 60 million plus, surpasses all other war-death-tolls.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Military_personnel" title="Military personnel">Military personnel</a> subject to combat in war often suffer mental and physical injuries, including depression, <a href="/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder" title="Posttraumatic stress disorder">posttraumatic stress disorder</a>, disease, injury, and death.</p><p>In every war in which American soldiers have fought in, the chances of becoming a psychiatric casualty &#x2013; of being debilitated for some period of time as a consequence of the stresses of military life &#x2013; were greater than the chances of being killed by enemy fire.</p><p>During World War II, research conducted by <a href="/wiki/US_Army" class="mw-redirect" title="US Army">US Army</a> <a href="/wiki/Brigadier_general_(United_States)" title="Brigadier general (United States)">Brigadier General</a> <a href="/wiki/S.L.A._Marshall" title="S.L.A. Marshall">S.L.A. Marshall</a> found that, on average, only 15% to 20% of American riflemen in WWII combat fired at the enemy. In Civil War Collector&#x2019;s Encyclopedia, F.A. Lord notes that of the 27,574 discarded muskets found on the Gettysburg battlefield, nearly 90% were loaded, with 12,000 loaded more than once and 6,000 loaded 3 to 10 times. These studies suggest that most military personnel resist firing their weapons in combat, that &#x2013; as some theorists argue &#x2013; human beings have an inherent resistance to killing their fellow human beings. Swank and Marchand&#x2019;s WWII study found that after sixty days of continuous combat, 98% of all surviving military personnel will become psychiatric casualties. Psychiatric casualties manifest themselves in fatigue cases, confusional states, conversion hysteria, anxiety, obsessional and compulsive states, and character disorders.</p><p>One-tenth of mobilised American men were hospitalised for mental disturbances between 1942 and 1945, and after thirty-five days of uninterrupted combat, 98% of them manifested psychiatric disturbances in varying degrees.</p><p>Additionally, it has been estimated that anywhere from 18% to 54% of Vietnam war veterans suffered from <a href="/wiki/Post_Traumatic_Stress_Disorder" class="mw-redirect" title="Post Traumatic Stress Disorder">Post Traumatic Stress Disorder</a>.</p><p>Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white American males aged 13 to 43 died in the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, including about 6% in the North and approximately 18% in the South. The war remains the deadliest conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of 620,000 military personnel. <a href="/wiki/United_States_military_casualties_of_war" title="United States military casualties of war">United States military casualties of war</a> since 1775 have totaled over two million. Of the 60 million European military personnel who were mobilized in <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>, 8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured.</p><p>During <a href="/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France" class="mw-redirect" title="Napoleon I of France">Napoleon</a>&apos;s retreat from Moscow, more French military personnel died of <a href="/wiki/Typhus" title="Typhus">typhus</a> than were killed by the Russians. Of the 450,000 soldiers who crossed the <a href="/wiki/Neman_River" class="mw-redirect" title="Neman River">Neman</a> on 25 June 1812, less than 40,000 returned. More military personnel were killed from 1500&#x2013;1914 by typhus than from military action. In addition, if it were not for modern medical advances there would be thousands more dead from disease and infection. For instance, during the <a href="/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War" title="Seven Years&apos; War">Seven Years&apos; War</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Navy" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> reported that it conscripted 184,899 sailors, of whom 133,708 died of disease or were &apos;missing&apos;.</p><p>It is estimated that between 1985 and 1994, 378,000 people per year died due to war.</p><p>Most wars have resulted in significant loss of life, along with destruction of infrastructure and resources (which may lead to <a href="/wiki/Famine" title="Famine">famine</a>, disease, and death in the <a href="/wiki/Civilian" title="Civilian">civilian</a> <a href="/wiki/Population" title="Population">population</a>). During the <a href="/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War" title="Thirty Years&apos; War">Thirty Years&apos; War</a> in Europe, the population of the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> was reduced by 15 to 40 percent. Civilians in war zones may also be subject to war atrocities such as <a href="/wiki/Genocide" title="Genocide">genocide</a>, while survivors may suffer the psychological aftereffects of witnessing the destruction of war.</p><p>Most estimates of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II_casualties" title="World War II casualties">World War II casualties</a> indicate that around 60 million people died, 40 million of which were civilians. Deaths in the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> were around <a href="/wiki/World_War_II_casualties_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="World War II casualties of the Soviet Union">27 million</a>. Since a high proportion of those killed were young men who had not yet fathered any children, population growth in the postwar Soviet Union was much lower than it otherwise would have been.</p><p>Once a war has ended, losing nations are sometimes required to pay <a href="/wiki/War_reparations" title="War reparations">war reparations</a> to the victorious nations. In certain cases, land is ceded to the victorious nations. For example, the territory of <a href="/wiki/Alsace-Lorraine" title="Alsace-Lorraine">Alsace-Lorraine</a> has been traded between France and Germany on three different occasions.</p><p>Typically speaking, war becomes very intertwined with the economy and many wars are partially or entirely based on economic reasons. Some economists believe war can stimulate a country&apos;s economy (high government spending for World War II is often credited with bringing the USA out of the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> by most <a href="/wiki/Keynesian" class="mw-redirect" title="Keynesian">Keynesian</a> economists) but in many cases, such as the wars of Louis XIV, the <a href="/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War" title="Franco-Prussian War">Franco-Prussian War</a>, and <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>, warfare serves only to damage the economy of the countries involved. For example, Russia&apos;s involvement in World War I took such a toll on the Russian economy that it almost collapsed and greatly contributed to the start of the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1917" class="mw-redirect" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution of 1917</a>.</p><p>One of the starkest illustrations of the effect of war upon economies is the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" class="mw-redirect" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> of the 1930s ended as nations increased and improved on their production of war materials to serve and survive the <a href="/wiki/War_effort" title="War effort">war effort</a>. The financial cost of World War II is estimated at about a trillion U.S. dollars worldwide, making it the most costly war in history in terms of capital as well as lives.</p><p>By the end of the war, the European economy had collapsed with 70% of the industrial infrastructure destroyed. Property damage in the Soviet Union inflicted by the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)" title="Eastern Front (World War II)">Axis invasion</a> was estimated at a value of 679 billion rubles. The combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710 cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850 industrial establishments, 40,000&#xA0;mi (64,374&#xA0;km) of railroad, 4100 railroad stations, 40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000 public libraries.</p><p>War leads to <a href="/wiki/Forced_migration" title="Forced migration">forced migration</a> causing potentially large displacements of population/demography. Among forced migrants there are usually relatively large shares/number of artists, doctors, lawyers, accountants and other types of individuals with great minds and talents, causing so the war effects to be particularly harmful for the country&#x2019;s creative potential in the long-run.</p><p>War is further argued to have a direct impact on artistic output, as it disrupts the production processes and distribution of artworks. Since creativity in the arts is often an expression of intense feeling, and as war affects the frame of mind of an artist, it has a negative effect on an artists&#x2019; individual life-cycle output.</p><p>It is not uncommon that during Wars, cultural institutions, such as libraries, are seen as &#x201C;targets in themselves; their elimination was a way to denigrate and demoralize the enemy population.&#x201D; It is important to know about and understand the impact such destruction can have on a society because &#x201C;in an era in which competing ideologies fuel internal and international conflict, the destruction of libraries, historical arts and other items of cultural significance is neither random nor irrelevant. This leads to destruction of peace thus affecting various sectors, including <a href="/wiki/Tourism" title="Tourism">tourism</a> which is a major source of many countries&apos; income. Preserving the world&#x2019;s repositories of knowledge is crucial to ensuring that the darkest moments of history do not endlessly repeat themselves.&#x201D;</p><p>Entities deliberately contemplating going to war and entities considering whether to end a war may formulate <i>war aims</i> as an evaluation/propaganda tool.

Organizations like <a href="/wiki/Stop_the_War_Coalition" title="Stop the War Coalition">Stop the War Coalition</a>, based in the United Kingdom, work on campaigning against the war. They raise awareness of the war, organize demonstrations, and lobby the governments. Significant worldwide <a href="/wiki/Opposition_to_the_Iraq_War" title="Opposition to the Iraq War">opposition to the Iraq War</a> also exists. Critics oppose the war based on the argument of violation of sovereignty, absence of the UN approval, and perceived illegitimacy.</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Mexican_Drug_War" title="Mexican Drug War">Mexican Drug War</a>, with estimated casualties of 40,000 since December 2006, has been recently facing a fundamental opposition. In 2011, the movement for peace and justice has started a popular middle-class movement against the war. It has won the recognition of President Calderon, who started the war, but has not ended it.</p><p>Governments also use the method of <a href="/wiki/Disarmament" title="Disarmament">disarmament</a> to stop and prevent the cost of war.</p><p>There is no scholarly agreement on which are the most common motivations for war. Motivations may be different for those ordering the war than for those undertaking the war. For example, in the <a href="/wiki/Third_Punic_War" title="Third Punic War">Third Punic War</a>, Rome&apos;s leaders may have wished to make war with <a href="/wiki/Carthage" title="Carthage">Carthage</a> for the purpose of eliminating a resurgent rival, while the individual soldiers may have been motivated by a wish to make money. Since many people are involved, a war may acquire a life of its own from the confluence of many different motivations. An interpretation of the ancient Jewish commentary (BeReshit Rabbah) on the fight between <a href="/wiki/Cain_and_Abel" title="Cain and Abel">Cain and Abel</a> in Genesis 4 (Parashot BeReshit XXII:7) states that there are three universal reasons for wars: (A) Economics, (B) Power, and (C) Religion. As the strategic and tactical aspects of warfare are always changing, theories and doctrines relating to warfare are often reformulated before, during, and after every major war. <a href="/wiki/Carl_von_Clausewitz" title="Carl von Clausewitz">Carl von Clausewitz</a> said, &apos;Every age had its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions, and its own peculiar preconceptions.&apos; The one constant factor is war&#x2019;s employment of organized violence and the resultant destruction of property and/or lives that necessarily follows.</p><p>Dutch psychoanalyst <a href="/wiki/Joost_Meerloo" title="Joost Meerloo">Joost Meerloo</a> held that, &quot;War is often...a mass discharge of accumulated internal rage (where)...the inner fears of mankind are discharged in mass destruction.&quot; Thus war can sometimes be a means by which man&apos;s own frustration at his inability to master his own self is expressed and temporarily relieved via his unleashing of destructive behavior upon <i>others.</i> In this destructive scenario, these <i>others</i> are made to serve as the scapegoat of man&apos;s own unspoken and subconscious frustrations and fears.</p><p>Other psychoanalysts such as E.F.M. Durban and <a href="/wiki/John_Bowlby" title="John Bowlby">John Bowlby</a> have argued that human beings are <a href="/wiki/Inheritance" title="Inheritance">inherently</a> violent. This aggressiveness is fueled by <a href="/wiki/Displacement_(psychology)" title="Displacement (psychology)">displacement</a> and <a href="/wiki/Psychological_projection" title="Psychological projection">projection</a> where a person transfers his or her grievances into bias and hatred against other <a href="/wiki/Race_(human_classification)" class="mw-redirect" title="Race (human classification)">races</a>, religions, nations or <a href="/wiki/Ideology" title="Ideology">ideologies</a>. By this theory, the nation state preserves order in the local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare. If war is innate to human nature, as is presupposed and predetermined by many psychological theories, then there is little hope of ever escaping it.</p><p>The Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, a follower of <a href="/wiki/Melanie_Klein" title="Melanie Klein">Melanie Klein</a>, thought that war was the paranoid or projective &#x201C;elaboration&#x201D; of mourning. Fornari thought that war and violence develop out of our &#x201C;love need&#x201D;: our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached, namely our early mother and our fusion with her. For the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare. Fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for their country, to give over their bodies to their nation.</p><p>Despite Fornari&apos;s theory that man&apos;s altruistic desire for self-sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war, in history only a tiny fraction of wars have originated from a desire for war from the general populace. Far more often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers. One psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by Maurice Walsh. He argues that the general populace is more neutral towards war and that wars only occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are placed into power. War is caused by leaders that seek war such as <a href="/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France" class="mw-redirect" title="Napoleon I of France">Napoleon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Hitler</a>. Such leaders most often come to power in times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then leads the nation to war.</p><p>Naturally, the common people don&apos;t want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. ... the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.</p><p>Several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare. There are two main schools: One sees organized warfare as emerging only in or after the Mesolithic as a result of complex social organization and greater population density and <a href="/wiki/Competition" title="Competition">competition</a> over resources; the other school sees human warfare as a more ancient practice that derives from common animal tendencies, such as territoriality and sexual competition.</p><p>The latter school argues that since warlike behavior patterns are found in many primate species such as <a href="/wiki/Chimpanzee" title="Chimpanzee">chimpanzees</a>, as well as in many <a href="/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ant</a> species, group conflict may be a general feature of animal social behavior. Some proponents of the idea argue that war, while innate, has been intensified greatly by developments of technology and social organization such as weaponry and states.</p><p>In <i><a href="/wiki/The_Blank_Slate" title="The Blank Slate">The Blank Slate</a></i>, psychologist and linguist <a href="/wiki/Steven_Pinker" title="Steven Pinker">Steven Pinker</a> claims that war-related behaviors may have been naturally selected in the ancestral environment due to the benefits of winning wars, e.g. gaining territory and women. He also argues that in order to have credible <a href="/wiki/Deterrence_theory" title="Deterrence theory">deterrence</a> against other groups (as well as on an individual level), it was important to have a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for <a href="/wiki/Revenge" title="Revenge">revenge</a> as well as for protecting a group&apos;s (or an individual&apos;s) reputation (&quot;<a href="/wiki/Honor" class="mw-redirect" title="Honor">honor</a>&quot;). In <i><a href="/wiki/The_Better_Angels_of_Our_Nature" title="The Better Angels of Our Nature">The Better Angels of Our Nature</a></i> Pinker argues that the development of the state and the police have dramatically reduced the level of warfare and violence in comparison to the ancestral environment. Whenever the state is not present, he says, such as in poor areas of a city, humans again organize in groups for protection and aggression and concepts such as violent revenge and protecting honor again become extremely important.</p><p>Crofoot and Wrangham have argued that warfare, if defined as group interactions in which &quot;coalitions attempt to aggressively dominate or kill members of other groups&quot;, is a characteristic of most human societies. Those in which it has been lacking &quot;tend to be societies that were politically dominated by their neighbors&quot;.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Ashley_Montagu" title="Ashley Montagu">Ashley Montagu</a> strongly denied universalistic instinctual arguments, arguing that social factors and childhood socialization are important in determining the nature and presence of warfare. Thus, he argues, warfare is not a universal human occurrence and appears to have been a historical invention, associated with certain types of human societies. Montagu&apos;s argument is supported by ethnographic research conducted in societies where the concept of aggression seems to be entirely absent, e.g. the <a href="/wiki/Chewong" class="mw-redirect" title="Chewong">Chewong</a> and <a href="/wiki/Semai_people" title="Semai people">Semai</a> of the Malay peninsula. Bobbi S. Low has observed correlation between warfare and education, noting that societies where warfare is commonplace encourage their children to be more aggressive.</p><p>War can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive international system. In this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets for <a href="/wiki/Natural_resource" title="Natural resource">natural resources</a> and for wealth. War has also been linked to <a href="/wiki/Economic_development" title="Economic development">economic development</a> by economic historians and development economists studying <a href="/wiki/State-building" title="State-building">state-building</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fiscal_capacity" title="Fiscal capacity">fiscal capacity</a>. While this theory has been applied to many conflicts, such counter arguments become less valid as the increasing mobility of capital and information level the distributions of wealth worldwide, or when considering that it is relative, not absolute, wealth differences that may fuel wars. There are those on the extreme <a href="/wiki/Right_(politics)" class="mw-redirect" title="Right (politics)">right</a> of the political spectrum who provide support, fascists in particular, by asserting a natural right of a strong nation to whatever the weak cannot hold by force. Some centrist, capitalist, world leaders, including <a href="/wiki/Presidents_of_the_United_States" class="mw-redirect" title="Presidents of the United States">Presidents of the United States</a> and U.S. <a href="/wiki/General_officer" title="General officer">Generals</a>, expressed support for an economic view of war.</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Marxism" title="Marxism">Marxist</a> theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states that all modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great (<a href="/wiki/Imperialism" title="Imperialism">imperialist</a>) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of the <a href="/wiki/Free_market" title="Free market">free market</a> and <a href="/wiki/Social_class" title="Social class">class system</a>. Part of the theory is that war will only disappear once a <a href="/wiki/World_revolution" title="World revolution">world revolution</a>, over-throwing free markets and class systems, has occurred. Marxist philosopher <a href="/wiki/Rosa_Luxemburg" title="Rosa Luxemburg">Rosa Luxemburg</a> theorized that <a href="/wiki/Imperialism" title="Imperialism">imperialism</a> was the result of capitalist countries needing new <a href="/wiki/Market_(economics)" title="Market (economics)">markets</a>. Expansion of the <a href="/wiki/Means_of_production" title="Means of production">means of production</a> is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in <a href="/wiki/Consumer_demand" class="mw-redirect" title="Consumer demand">consumer demand</a>. Since the workers in a <a href="/wiki/Capitalist_economy" class="mw-redirect" title="Capitalist economy">capitalist economy</a> would be unable to fill the demand, producers must expand into non-capitalist markets to find consumers for their goods, hence driving imperialism.</p><p>Demographic theories can be grouped into two classes, Malthusian theories and <a href="/wiki/Youth_bulge" class="mw-redirect" title="Youth bulge">youth bulge</a> theories.</p><p>Malthusian theories see expanding population and scarce resources as a source of violent conflict.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Pope_Urban_II" title="Pope Urban II">Pope Urban II</a> in 1095, on the eve of the <a href="/wiki/First_Crusade" title="First Crusade">First Crusade</a>, spoke:</p><p>For this land which you now inhabit, shut in on all sides by the sea and the mountain peaks, is too narrow for your large population; it scarcely furnishes food enough for its cultivators. Hence it is that you murder and devour one another, that you wage wars, and that many among you perish in civil strife. Let hatred, therefore, depart from among you; let your quarrels end. Enter upon the road to the Holy Sepulchre; wrest that land from a wicked race, and subject it to yourselves.</p><p>This is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called the Malthusian theory of war, in which wars are caused by expanding populations and limited resources. <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Malthus" class="mw-redirect" title="Thomas Malthus">Thomas Malthus</a> (1766&#x2013;1834) wrote that populations always increase until they are limited by war, disease, or <a href="/wiki/Famine" title="Famine">famine</a>.</p><p>This theory is thought by Malthusians to account for the relative decrease in wars during the past fifty years, especially in the <a href="/wiki/Developed_country" title="Developed country">developed world</a>, where advances in agriculture have made it possible to support a much larger population than was formerly the case, and where <a href="/wiki/Birth_control" title="Birth control">birth control</a> has dramatically slowed the increase in population.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Youth_bulge" class="mw-redirect" title="Youth bulge">Youth bulge</a> theory differs significantly from Malthusian theories. Its adherents see a combination of large male youth cohorts &#x2013; as graphically represented as a &quot;youth bulge&quot; in a <a href="/wiki/Population_pyramid" title="Population pyramid">population pyramid</a> &#x2013; with a lack of regular, peaceful employment opportunities as a risk pool for violence.</p><p>While Malthusian theories focus on a disparity between a growing population and available natural resources, youth bulge theory focuses on a disparity between non-inheriting, &apos;excess&apos; young males and available social positions within the existing social system of <a href="/wiki/Division_of_labour" title="Division of labour">division of labour</a>. Young males who cannot find acceptable positions within the existing system of division of labour and thus become &quot;socially superfluous&quot; are, according to youth bulge theory, prone to become violent in one form or another. This implies that in a situation where a youth bulge is given, a major <a href="/wiki/Economic_depression" class="mw-redirect" title="Economic depression">economic depression</a> with massively increasing unemployment will likely lead to outbreaks of violence (as, for example, evidenced in Europe during the great depression, when fascist organizations mobilized a lot of male youth to march the streets).</p><p>Contributors to the development of <a href="/wiki/Youth_bulge" class="mw-redirect" title="Youth bulge">youth bulge</a> theory include French sociologist Gaston Bouthoul, U.S. sociologist <a href="/wiki/Jack_Goldstone" title="Jack Goldstone">Jack A. Goldstone</a>, U.S. political scientist Gary Fuller, and German sociologist <a href="/wiki/Gunnar_Heinsohn" title="Gunnar Heinsohn">Gunnar Heinsohn</a>. <a href="/wiki/Samuel_P._Huntington" title="Samuel P. Huntington">Samuel Huntington</a> has modified his <a href="/wiki/The_Clash_of_Civilizations" class="mw-redirect" title="The Clash of Civilizations">Clash of Civilizations</a> theory by using youth bulge theory as its foundation:</p><p>I don&apos;t think Islam is any more violent than any other religions, and I suspect if you added it all up, more people have been slaughtered by Christians over the centuries than by Muslims. But the key factor is the demographic factor. Generally speaking, the people who go out and kill other people are males between the ages of 16 and 30.</p><p>During the 1960s, 70s and 80s there were high birth rates in the Muslim world, and this has given rise to a huge youth bulge. But the bulge will fade. Muslim birth rates are going down; in fact, they have dropped dramatically in some countries. Islam did spread by the sword originally, but I don&apos;t think there is anything inherently violent in Muslim theology.</p><p>Youth Bulge theories represent a relatively recent development but seem to have become more influential in guiding U.S. foreign policy and military strategy as both Goldstone and Fuller have acted as consultants to the U.S. Government. CIA Inspector General <a href="/wiki/John_L._Helgerson" title="John L. Helgerson">John L. Helgerson</a> referred to youth bulge theory in his 2002 report &quot;The National Security Implications of Global Demographic Change&quot;.</p><p>According to Heinsohn, who has proposed youth bulge theory in its most generalized form, a youth bulge occurs when 30 to 40 percent of the males of a nation belong to the &quot;fighting age&quot; cohorts from 15 to 29 years of age. It will follow periods with <a href="/wiki/Total_fertility_rate" title="Total fertility rate">total fertility rates</a> as high as 4&#x2013;8 children per woman with a 15&#x2013;29-year delay.</p><p>A total fertility rate of 2.1 children born by a woman during her lifetime represents a situation in which the son will replace the father, and the daughter will replace the mother, accounting for a small proportion of deaths to factors such as illness and accidents. Thus, a total fertility rate of 2.1 represents replacement level, while anything below represents a <a href="/wiki/Sub-replacement_fertility" title="Sub-replacement fertility">sub-replacement fertility</a> rate leading to <a href="/wiki/Population_decline" title="Population decline">population decline</a>.</p><p>Total fertility rates above 2.1 will lead to population growth and to a youth bulge. A total fertility rate of 4&#x2013;8 children per mother implies 2&#x2013;4 sons per mother. Consequently, one father has to leave not 1, but 2 to 4 social positions (jobs) to give all his sons a perspective for life, which is usually hard to achieve. Since respectable positions cannot be increased at the same speed as food, textbooks and vaccines, many &quot;angry young men&quot; find themselves in a situation that tends to escalate their adolescent anger into violence: they are</p><p>The combination of these <a href="/wiki/Stress_(biological)" class="mw-redirect" title="Stress (biological)">stress</a> factors according to Heinsohn usually heads for one of six different exits:</p><p>Religions and ideologies are seen as secondary factors that are being used to legitimate violence, but will not lead to violence by themselves if no youth bulge is present. Consequently, youth bulge theorists see both past &quot;Christianist&quot; European colonialism and imperialism and today&apos;s &quot;Islamist&quot; civil unrest and terrorism as results of high birth rates producing youth bulges &#x2013; with the Israeli-occupied <a href="/wiki/Gaza_Strip" title="Gaza Strip">Gaza Strip</a> now being seen as another example of youth-bulge-driven violence.</p><p>Among prominent historical events that have been linked to the existence of youth bulges is the role played by the historically large youth cohorts in the rebellion and revolution waves of early modern Europe, including the <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a> of 1789, and the importance of economic depression hitting the largest German youth cohorts ever in explaining the rise of <a href="/wiki/Nazism" title="Nazism">Nazism</a> in Germany in the 1930s.

Rationalism (and <a href="/wiki/Neorealism_(international_relations)" title="Neorealism (international relations)">Neorealism (international relations)</a>) operate under the assumption that states or international actors are rational, seek the best possible outcomes for themselves, and desire to avoid the costs of war. Under a <a href="/wiki/Game_theory" title="Game theory">Game theory</a> approach, rationalist theories posit that all actors can bargain, would be better off if war did not occur, and likewise seek to understand why war nonetheless reoccurs. In &quot;Rationalist Explanations for War&quot;, <a href="/wiki/James_Fearon" title="James Fearon">James Fearon</a> seeks to answer this <a href="/wiki/War%27s_inefficiency_puzzle" title="War&apos;s inefficiency puzzle">puzzle</a> by examining three rationalist explanations for why some countries cannot find a bargain and instead resort to war:</p><p>&quot;Issue indivisibility&quot; occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by bargaining because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be shared between them, only owned entirely by one side or the other. Religious issues, such as control over the <a href="/wiki/Temple_Mount" title="Temple Mount">Temple Mount</a> in Jerusalem, are more likely to be indivisible than economic issues.</p><p>&quot;<a href="/wiki/Information_asymmetry" title="Information asymmetry">Information asymmetry</a> with incentives to misrepresent&quot; occurs when two countries have secrets about their individual capabilities, and do not agree on either: who would win a war between them, or the magnitude of state&apos;s victory or loss. For instance, <a href="/wiki/Geoffrey_Blainey" title="Geoffrey Blainey">Geoffrey Blainey</a> argues that war is a result of miscalculation of strength. He cites historical examples of war and demonstrates, &quot;war is usually the outcome of a diplomatic crisis which cannot be solved because both sides have conflicting estimates of their bargaining power.&quot; States will not avoid the bargaining failure by sharing their secrets, since they cannot trust each other not to lie and exaggerate their strength to extract more concessions. For example, Sweden made efforts to deceive Nazi Germany that it would resist an attack fiercely, partly by playing on the myth of Aryan superiority and by making sure that <a href="/wiki/Hermann_G%C3%B6ring" title="Hermann G&#xF6;ring">Hermann G&#xF6;ring</a> only saw elite troops in action, often dressed up as regular soldiers, when he came to visit. Another example is the American decision to enter the <a href="/wiki/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>. This decision was made with the full knowledge that the communist forces would resist them, but without the belief that the guerrillas had the capability to oppose <a href="/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces" title="United States Armed Forces">American forces</a> for long.</p><p>Thirdly, bargaining may fail due to the states&apos; inability to make credible commitments. In this scenario, the two countries might be able to come to a bargain that would avert war if they could stick to it, but the benefits of the bargain will make one side more powerful and lead it to demand even more in the future, so that the weaker side has an incentive to make a stand now.</p><p>Within the rationalist tradition, some theorists have suggested individuals engaged in war suffer a normal level of <a href="/wiki/Cognitive_bias" title="Cognitive bias">cognitive bias</a>, but are still &quot;as rational as you and me&quot;. According to philosopher <a href="/wiki/Iain_King" title="Iain King">Iain King</a>, &quot;Most instigators of conflict overrate their chances of success, while most participants underrate their chances of injury....&quot; King asserts that &quot;Most catastrophic military decisions are rooted in <a href="/wiki/GroupThink" class="mw-redirect" title="GroupThink">GroupThink</a>&quot; which is faulty, but still rational.</p><p>Rationalist explanations of war can be critiqued on a number of grounds. The assumptions of cost-benefit calculations become dubious in the most extreme genocidal cases of World War II, where the only bargain offered in some cases was infinitely bad. Rationalist theories typically assume that the state acts as a unitary individual, doing what is best for the state as a whole; this is problematic when, for example, the country&apos;s leader is beholden to a very small number of people, as in a personalistic dictatorship.</p><p>The rationalist theory focused around bargaining is currently under debate.

If two countries have a profitable trading relationship, it&apos;s assumed that war would hurt both of them economically, making it less attractive. Realists respond that military force may sometimes be at least as effective as trade at achieving economic benefits, especially historically if not as much today. Also, trade can create dependence that allows for coercion, which can escalate conflict. Empirical data on the relationship of trade to peace are mixed, and moreover, some evidence suggests that countries at war don&apos;t necessarily trade less with each other.</p><p>These theories suggest that differences in people&apos;s personalities, decision-making, emotions, belief systems, and biases are important in determining whether conflicts get out of hand.

The debate in the West, generally speaking, has two main viewpoints: <a href="/wiki/Pacifists" class="mw-redirect" title="Pacifists">Pacifists</a>, who believe that war is inherently immoral and therefore is never justified regardless of circumstances, and those who believe that war is sometimes necessary and can be moral.</p><p>There are two different aspects to ethics in war, according to the most prominent and influential thought on justice and war: the <a href="/wiki/Just_War_Theory" class="mw-redirect" title="Just War Theory">Just War Theory</a>. First is <i><a href="/wiki/Jus_ad_bellum" title="Jus ad bellum">jus ad bellum</a></i> (literally translated as &quot;right to war&quot;), which dictates which unfriendly acts and circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another nation. There are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war: first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit large-scale violence; third, the just belligerent must have rightful intentions &#x2013; namely, that they seek to advance good and curtail evil; fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success; fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought must be proportional to means being used.</p><p>Once a just war has been declared, the second standard, or aspect, is put into effect. <i><a href="/wiki/Jus_in_bello" class="mw-redirect" title="Jus in bello">Jus in bello</a></i>, which literally translates to &quot;right in war&quot;, are the ethical rules of conduct when conducting war. The two main principles in <i>jus in bello</i> are proportionality and discrimination. Proportionality regards how much force is necessary and morally appropriate to the ends being sought and the injustice suffered. The principle of discrimination determines who are the legitimate targets in a war, and specifically makes a separation between combatants, who it is permissible to kill, and non-combatants, who it is not. Failure to follow these rules can result in the loss of legitimacy for the just war belligerent, and so thereby forfeit the moral right and justice of their cause.</p><p>The Just War standard is as old as Western Civilization itself, and still has significant impact on thinking about the morality of wars and violence today. Just War Theory was foundational in the creation of the United Nations and in <a href="/wiki/International_Law" class="mw-redirect" title="International Law">International Law</a>&apos;s regulations on legitimate war.</p><p>These two positions generally cover the broad philosophical and ethical bents of mainstream society. However, there are several theories on and about war which are in the minority in culture, but which, because of the influence they have had in recent history, demand mention here. These strains of thought on human society and war can be broken up into two main camps: <a href="/wiki/Marxist" class="mw-redirect" title="Marxist">Marxist</a> and Fascist, both of which view war as purely practical.</p><p>Marxism, and other such <a href="/wiki/Historicist" class="mw-redirect" title="Historicist">historicist</a> ideals, hold that history advances through a set of <a href="/wiki/Dialectics" class="mw-redirect" title="Dialectics">dialectics</a> (as stated by <a href="/wiki/Heinrich_Moritz_Chalyb%C3%A4us" title="Heinrich Moritz Chalyb&#xE4;us">Heinrich Moritz Chalyb&#xE4;us</a>: thesis, antithesis, synthesis).
