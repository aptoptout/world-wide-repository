In the present, Batook Patel(<a href="/wiki/Boman_Irani" title="Boman Irani">Boman Irani</a>) is a wealthy and successful businessman with three beautiful daughters: Ganga(<a href="/wiki/Jacqueline_Fernandez" title="Jacqueline Fernandez">Jacqueline Fernandez</a>), Jamuna(<a href="/wiki/Lisa_Haydon" title="Lisa Haydon">Lisa Haydon</a>), and Saraswati(<a href="/wiki/Nargis_Fakhri" title="Nargis Fakhri">Nargis Fakhri</a>). However, he does not want his daughters to get married, as he claims that all the women in his family are cursed if they get married.</p><p>One night, at a friend&apos;s bachelorette party, the girls reveal to their friend that secretly, they each have a boyfriend. Jamuna&apos;s boyfriend is Teddy(<a href="/wiki/Riteish_Deshmukh" title="Riteish Deshmukh">Riteish Deshmukh</a>), who wants to be a racecar driver. Teddy is skilled at racing, but during an important race, his car runs out of gas, and loses. Saraswati&apos;s boyfriend is Bunty(<a href="/wiki/Abhishek_Bachchan" title="Abhishek Bachchan">Abhishek Bachchan</a>), who wants to be rapper. During a talent competition, the judge claims that his rapping talent is ordinary. Bunty then raps in Hindi swear words at the judge. Unfortunately, the judge knows Hindi, and disqualifies him. Ganga&apos;s boyfriend is Sandy(<a href="/wiki/Akshay_Kumar" title="Akshay Kumar">Akshay Kumar</a>), who wants to be a professional football/soccer player. During tryouts for a team, the coach, who&apos;s racist, tells him he can&apos;t join, and calls him a &quot;Bloody Indian&quot;, which triggers Sandy&apos;s evil personality, Sundi, to come out and attack the coach and team. Sandy learns that Sundi comes out whenever he hears the word &quot;Indian&quot;, and his Dissociative Identity Disorder comes from being depressed about not having enough money to make a living. Sandy sees Batook&apos;s success in the paper, and decides to date his doctor, and Batook&apos;s daughter, Ganga. When the girls tell their dad that they each have a boyfriend, Batook goes to his friend, Aakhri Pasta(<a href="/wiki/Chunkey_Pandey" class="mw-redirect" title="Chunkey Pandey">Chunkey Pandey</a>), who owns an Italian restaurant. Batook convinces Pasta to dress up as the family&apos;s fortune teller, Aakhri Aasta. Aasta claims that that when Ganga&apos;s husband first steps foot into Batook&apos;s house, Jamuna&apos;s husband first sees Batook, or when Saraswati&apos;s husband first speaks to Batook, then Batook will have a heart attack, and die. The girls, wanting to keep their boyfriends, have them fake disabilities. Sandy rides around in a motorized wheelchair, and claims he can&apos;t use his feet. Teddy wears sunglasses and uses a cane, and claims he is blind. Bunty uses sign language, and claims that he is mute. Batook decides to test the boys to make sure if they are really disabled, by putting ants in Sandy&apos;s pants, having Teddy jump in an empty pool, and injuring Bunty to see if he screams. When Batook is out of the house, the boys reveal themselves to each other as not being disabled. Since they all want Batook&apos;s money, they decide not to tell on each other, as they each have a recording of the other. At Pasta&apos;s restaurant, Batook reveals to Pasta that his daughters are actually the daughters of Urja Nagre, an underworld crime lord. Nagre was caught when someone informed the police. While in jail, Nagre requested Batook take care of his daughters in London, but make sure that they never found out that Nagre was his daughter. Batook also reveals that he was the one who informed the police, and didn&apos;t want the girls to marry until his sons(the robbers in the beginning of the film) got out of prison. Unbeknownst to him, Nagre is out of prison, and has arrived in London.</p><p>While the girls prepare a wax statue for Batook, the boys go into town, where some gangsters are teasing some girls. Suddenly, Nagre appears, and attack the gangsters. After the gangsters run away, Nagre sees the boys, and ask why didn&apos;t help. The boys claim that they were disabled. Bunty, who was in the wheelchair at the time, claims he was crippled. Sandy, holding Teddy&apos;s cane, claims he is blind, and that Teddy is mute. Later, Nagre goes to Batook&apos;s office, and ask him about his daughters&apos;s future husbands. Batook says that while the girls&apos;s future husbands are disabled, he knows three normal men who are suitable for the daughters. Batook takes Nagre to a <a href="/wiki/Gurdwara" title="Gurdwara">Gurdwara</a> to see his sons, Rishi(<a href="/wiki/Samir_Kochhar" title="Samir Kochhar">Samir Kochhar</a>), Rohan(<a href="/wiki/Nikitin_Dheer" title="Nikitin Dheer">Nikitin Dheer</a>), and Rajeev(<a href="/wiki/Aarav_Chowdhary" title="Aarav Chowdhary">Aarav Chowdhary</a>), claiming they are orphans who do community service. Nagre decides that the three are suitable for his daughters.</p><p>At Batook&apos;s house, Nagre claims that Batook owes Nagre 500 crores (50 million) of British Pounds. Nagre gives Batook and the boys 10 days to make up the money, or Ganga, Jamuna, and Saraswati must marry Rishi, Rohan, and Rajeev. During these 10 days, Nagre and his &quot;sons&quot; will also live in Batook&apos;s house, meaning that while in front of both Batook and Nagre, Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty must act as blind-disabled, mute-blind, and disabled-mute. Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty come up with a plan to get rid of Nagre&apos;s sons. During a St. Patrick&apos;s Day party, the girls get Rishi, Rohan, and Rajeev drunk. The next day, they tell each other that they had sex with their respective girls, only to find out that they had sex with the maids. The maids request compensation, or they will sue, of 50 million Pounds. Nagre, learning this, says that the girls will marry the boys of their choosing.</p><p>The next day, the girls take Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty to church, asking for forgiveness. Saraswati, who takes care of disabled children, tells them that two boys were mocking a child because of his disability. The girls feel guilty, because they felt that they were mocking people with disabilities by having the boys act as if they were blind, deaf, and mute. After this, the boys feel guilty, as they were only marrying the girls for money. They go to the warehouse area of Madame Tussauds to meet their girlfriends. They instead find Batook&apos;s sons, who explain that they found out the boys were normal. While Teddy and Bunty fight Batook&apos;s sons&apos; gang members, Sandy has accidentally heard Teddy say &quot;Indian&quot;, and Sundi, Sandy&apos;s alternate personality, tries to kill Sandy. Batook arrives, and blackmails the boys that Nagre&apos;s fortune of 50 million will be divided into 7 parts: Rishi, Rohan, Rajeev, Batook, Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty&apos;s shares. Sundi says to divide it into 8 shares, as Sandy/Sundi counts as two people. Aakhri Pasta arrives, and demands his share, splitting it into 9 parts. However, the three maids each demand two shares, one for them, and the other for their unborn children they are now carrying. Nagre then arrives, and explains that he found a recording on Bunty&apos;s laptop, which revealed that Bunty, Sandy, and Teddy were not disabled. Nagre also overheard Batook, who told his sons that he was responsible for getting Nagre in prison. Nagre then attempts to kill everyone in the warehouse, while the lights turn on and off. As the girls arrive, Rishi, Rohan, and Rajeev see them, and hold them at knifepoint in front of Nagre. Sandy, Teddy, and Bunty then rush to save the girls, injuring themselves in the process. As they lay in the girls arms, the boys tell the truth to the girls, and Batook explains how Nagre is their father. The girls forgive the boys, and reconcile with Nagre.</p><p>The film grossed approximately <span class="nowrap"><span style="white-space: nowrap">&#x20B9;</span>15.25 crore</span> (US$2.3&#xA0;million) in India and <span class="nowrap"><span style="white-space: nowrap">&#x20B9;</span>13.36 crore</span> (US$2.0&#xA0;million) from overseas territories on its opening day.
