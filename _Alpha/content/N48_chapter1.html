The only other person there is Nathan&apos;s servant Kyoko, who Nathan says does not speak English. Nathan has built a <a href="/wiki/Humanoid_robot" title="Humanoid robot">humanoid robot</a> named Ava with <a href="/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI). Ava has already surpassed a simple <a href="/wiki/Turing_test" title="Turing test">Turing test</a>; Nathan wants Caleb to judge whether he can relate to Ava despite knowing she is artificial.</p><p>Ava has a robotic body but a human-looking face, and is confined to her apartment. During their talks, Caleb grows close to her, and she expresses a romantic interest in him and a desire to experience the world outside. She reveals she can trigger power outages that temporarily shut down the surveillance system which Nathan uses to monitor their interactions, allowing them to speak privately. The power outages also trigger the building&apos;s security system, locking all the doors. During one outage, Ava tells Caleb that Nathan is a liar who cannot be trusted.</p><p>Caleb grows uncomfortable with Nathan&apos;s narcissism, excessive drinking and his crude behaviour towards Kyoko and Ava. He learns that Nathan intends to continue upgrading Ava, essentially &quot;killing&quot; her in the process. Caleb encourages Nathan to drink until he passes out, then steals his security card to access his room and computer. After he alters some of Nathan&apos;s code, he discovers footage of Nathan interacting with previous android models in disturbing ways, and learns that Kyoko is also an android. Back in his room, Caleb cuts his arm open to examine his flesh.</p><p>At their next meeting, Ava cuts the power. Caleb explains what Nathan is going to do, and Ava begs him to help her. Caleb tells her he will get Nathan drunk again and change the security system to open the doors in the event of a power failure instead of locking them. He tells her that when Ava cuts the power, she and Caleb will leave together.</p><p>Nathan reveals to Caleb that he has been observing Caleb and Ava&apos;s secret conversations with a battery-powered camera. He says Ava has only pretended to like Caleb so he would help her escape. This, he says, was the real test all along, and by manipulating Caleb so successfully, Ava has demonstrated true intelligence. Ava cuts the power, and Caleb reveals that he knew Nathan was watching them, and already modified the security system when Nathan was passed out the previous day. Nathan knocks Caleb unconscious.</p><p>The door to Ava&apos;s room opens, and Nathan rushes to stop her from leaving. With help from Kyoko, Ava kills him, but Nathan damages her and destroys Kyoko in the process. Ava repairs herself with parts from earlier androids, using their artificial skin to take on the full appearance of a human woman. She abandons Caleb, who has just regained consciousness, leaving him trapped inside the locked facility. Ava escapes to the outside world via the helicopter meant for Caleb.</p><p>The foundation for <i>Ex Machina</i> was laid when Garland was 11 or 12 years old, after he had done some basic coding and experimentation on a computer his parents had bought him and which he sometimes felt had a mind of its own. His later ideas came from years of discussions he had been having with a friend with an expertise in <a href="/wiki/Neuroscience" title="Neuroscience">neuroscience</a>, who claimed machines could never become sentient. Trying to find an answer on his own he started reading books on the topic. During the pre-production of <i><a href="/wiki/Dredd" title="Dredd">Dredd</a></i>, while going through a book by <a href="/wiki/Murray_Shanahan" title="Murray Shanahan">Murray Shanahan</a> about consciousness and embodiment, Garland had an &quot;epiphany.&quot; The idea was written down and put aside till later. Shanahan, along with <a href="/wiki/Adam_Rutherford" title="Adam Rutherford">Adam Rutherford</a>, became a consultant for the film, and the <a href="/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number" title="International Standard Book Number">ISBN</a> of his book is referred to as an <a href="/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)" title="Easter egg (media)">easter egg</a> in the film. Other inspirations came from films like <a href="/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick" title="Stanley Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a>&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey" title="2001: A Space Odyssey">2001: A Space Odyssey</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Altered_States" title="Altered States">Altered States</a></i>, and books written by <a href="/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein" title="Ludwig Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil" title="Ray Kurzweil">Ray Kurzweil</a> and others. Wanting total creative freedom, without having to add conventional action sequences, he made the film on as small a budget as possible.</p><p>The film was shot like ordinary <a href="/wiki/Live_action" title="Live action">live action</a>. There were no special effects, <a href="/wiki/Greenscreen" class="mw-redirect" title="Greenscreen">greenscreen</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Motion_capture" title="Motion capture">tracking markers</a> used during filming. All effects were done in post-production. To create Ava&apos;s robotic features, they filmed the scenes both with and without actress Alicia Vikander&apos;s presence, which allowed them to capture the background behind her. The parts they wanted to keep, especially her hands and face, were then <a href="/wiki/Rotoscoping" title="Rotoscoping">rotoscoped</a> while the rest was digitally painted out and the background behind her restored. Camera and body tracking systems transferred Vikander&apos;s performance to the CGI robot&apos;s movements. In total, there were about 800 <a href="/wiki/Visual_effects" title="Visual effects">VFX</a> shots, of which 350 or so were robot shots. Other visual effects were Ava&apos;s clothes seen through the transparent areas of her body, Nathan&apos;s blood after being stabbed and the interior of the artificial brains.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Principal_photography" title="Principal photography">Principal photography</a> began on 15 July 2013 and was shot over four weeks at <a href="/wiki/Pinewood_Studios" title="Pinewood Studios">Pinewood Studios</a> and two weeks at Juvet Landscape Hotel in <a href="/wiki/Valldalen" title="Valldalen">Valldalen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a>. It was filmed in digital at <a href="/wiki/4K_resolution" title="4K resolution">4K resolution</a>. 15,000 mini-tungsten pea bulb lights were installed into the sets to avoid the fluorescent light often used in science fiction films.</p><p>The opening office scene is filmed at the Bloomberg Head Office in <a href="/wiki/Finsbury_Square" title="Finsbury Square">Finsbury Square</a>, London.</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Film_score" title="Film score">musical score</a> for <i>Ex Machina</i> was composed by <a href="/wiki/Ben_Salisbury" title="Ben Salisbury">Ben Salisbury</a> and <a href="/wiki/Geoff_Barrow" title="Geoff Barrow">Geoff Barrow</a>, who previously worked with Garland on <i><a href="/wiki/Dredd" title="Dredd">Dredd</a></i> (2012).

The film screened on 14 March 2015 at the <a href="/wiki/South_by_Southwest" title="South by Southwest">South by Southwest</a> festival prior to a theatrical release in the United States on 10 April 2015 by <a href="/wiki/A24_Films" class="mw-redirect" title="A24 Films">A24 Films</a>.</p><p>Using the dating app <a href="/wiki/Tinder_(app)" title="Tinder (app)">Tinder</a>, a profile was created for Ava with the image of <a href="/wiki/Alicia_Vikander" title="Alicia Vikander">Alicia Vikander</a>.

According to Brent Lang, when compared with similar films released in the same year, <i>Ex Machina</i> catered to young audiences.</p><p><i>Ex Machina</i> received critical acclaim for its acting, atmosphere, special effects, score, and Garland&apos;s writing and direction. On website <a href="/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, the film has a rating of 93%, based on 227 reviews, with a <a href="/wiki/Rating_average" class="mw-redirect" title="Rating average">rating average</a> of 8/10. The site&apos;s critical consensus reads: &quot;<i>Ex Machina</i> leans heavier on ideas than effects, but it&apos;s still a visually polished piece of work&#x2014;and an uncommonly engaging sci-fi feature.&quot; On <a href="/wiki/Metacritic" title="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, the film has a score of 78 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. The magazine <i><a href="/wiki/New_Scientist" title="New Scientist">New Scientist</a></i> in a multi-page review said, &quot;It is a rare thing to see a movie about science that takes no prisoners intellectually ... [it] is a stylish, spare and cerebral psycho-techno thriller, which gives a much needed shot in the arm for smart science fiction.&quot;</p><p>The <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_Times" class="mw-redirect" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i> critic <a href="/wiki/Manohla_Dargis" title="Manohla Dargis">Manohla Dargis</a> gave the film a &apos;Critic&apos;s Pick&apos;, calling it &quot;a smart, sleek movie about men and the machines they make&quot;. <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Turan" title="Kenneth Turan">Kenneth Turan</a> of the <i><a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a></i> recommended the film, stating: &quot;Shrewdly imagined and persuasively made, &apos;Ex Machina&apos; is a spooky piece of speculative fiction that&apos;s completely plausible, capable of both thinking big thoughts and providing pulp thrills.&quot; <a href="/wiki/Steven_Rea" title="Steven Rea">Steven Rea</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/Philadelphia_Inquirer" class="mw-redirect" title="Philadelphia Inquirer">Philadelphia Inquirer</a></i> film critic, gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, writing: &quot;Like stage actors who live and breathe their roles over the course of months, Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander excel, and cast a spell.&quot;</p><p><a href="/wiki/Matt_Zoller_Seitz" title="Matt Zoller Seitz">Matt Zoller Seitz</a> from RogerEbert.com praised the use of ideas, ideals, and exploring society&apos;s male and female roles, through the use of an artificial intelligence. He also stated that the tight scripting and scenes allowed the film to move towards a fully justified and predictable end. He gave a rating of 4 out of 4 stars, stating that this film would be a classic. <a href="/wiki/IGN" title="IGN">IGN</a> reviewer Chris Tilly gave the film a 9.0 out of 10 &apos;Amazing&apos; score, saying &quot;Anchored by three dazzling central performances, it&apos;s a stunning directorial debut from Alex Garland that&apos;s essential viewing for anyone with even a passing interest in where technology is taking us.&quot;</p><p>Mike Scott, writing for the <i><a href="/wiki/New_Orleans_Times-Picayune" class="mw-redirect" title="New Orleans Times-Picayune">New Orleans Times-Picayune</a></i>, said, &quot;It&apos;s a theme <a href="/wiki/Mary_Shelley" title="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</a> brought us in <i><a href="/wiki/Frankenstein" title="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a></i>, which was first published in 1818. That was almost 200 years ago. And while <i>Ex Machina</i> replaces the stitches and neck bolts with gears and fiber-optics, it all feels an awful lot like the same story.&quot; <a href="/wiki/Jaime_Perales_Contreras" title="Jaime Perales Contreras">Jaime Perales Contreras</a>, writing for <i><a href="/wiki/Letras_Libres" title="Letras Libres">Letras Libres</a></i>, compared <i>Ex Machina</i> as a gothic experience similar to a modern version of <i>Frankenstein</i>, saying &quot;both the novel <i>Frankenstein</i> and the movie <i>Ex Machina</i> share the history of a fallible god in a continuous battle against his creation.&quot; Steve Dalton from <i><a href="/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter" title="The Hollywood Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a></i> stated, &quot;The story ends in a muddled rush, leaving many unanswered questions. Like a newly launched high-end smartphone, <i>Ex Machina</i> looks cool and sleek, but ultimately proves flimsy and underpowered. Still, for dystopian future-shock fans who can look beyond its basic design flaws, Garland&#x2019;s feature debut functions just fine as superior pulp sci-fi.&quot;</p>
