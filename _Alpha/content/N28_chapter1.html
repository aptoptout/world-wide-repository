In recent years, the sciences of <a href="/wiki/Psychology" title="Psychology">psychology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Anthropology" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Neuroscience" title="Neuroscience">neuroscience</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Biology" title="Biology">biology</a> have added to the understanding the concept of love.</p><p>Biological models of sex tend to view love as a <a href="/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammalian</a> drive, much like <a href="/wiki/Hunger" title="Hunger">hunger</a> or <a href="/wiki/Thirst" title="Thirst">thirst</a>. <a href="/wiki/Helen_Fisher_(anthropologist)" title="Helen Fisher (anthropologist)">Helen Fisher</a>, a leading expert in the topic of love, divides the experience of love into three partly overlapping stages: lust, attraction, and attachment. Lust is the feeling of <a href="/wiki/Sexual_desire" title="Sexual desire">sexual desire</a>; romantic attraction determines what partners mates find attractive and pursue, conserving time and energy by choosing; and attachment involves sharing a home, parental duties, mutual defense, and in humans involves feelings of safety and security. Three distinct neural circuitries, including neurotransmitters, and three behavioral patterns, are associated with these three romantic styles.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Lust" title="Lust">Lust</a> is the initial passionate sexual desire that promotes <a href="/wiki/Mating_(human)" class="mw-redirect" title="Mating (human)">mating</a>, and involves the increased release of chemicals such as <a href="/wiki/Testosterone" title="Testosterone">testosterone</a> and <a href="/wiki/Estrogen" title="Estrogen">estrogen</a>. These effects rarely last more than a few weeks or months. <a href="/wiki/Interpersonal_attraction" title="Interpersonal attraction">Attraction</a> is the more individualized and romantic desire for a specific candidate for mating, which develops out of lust as commitment to an individual mate forms. Recent studies in <a href="/wiki/Neuroscience" title="Neuroscience">neuroscience</a> have indicated that as people fall in love, the brain consistently releases a certain set of chemicals, including the <a href="/wiki/Neuroendocrine" class="mw-redirect" title="Neuroendocrine">neurotransmitter hormones</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dopamine" title="Dopamine">dopamine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Norepinephrine" title="Norepinephrine">norepinephrine</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Serotonin" title="Serotonin">serotonin</a>, the same compounds released by <a href="/wiki/Amphetamine" title="Amphetamine">amphetamine</a>, stimulating the brain&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Pleasure_center" class="mw-redirect" title="Pleasure center">pleasure center</a> and leading to side effects such as increased <a href="/wiki/Heart_rate" title="Heart rate">heart rate</a>, loss of <a href="/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)" title="Anorexia (symptom)">appetite</a> and <a href="/wiki/Insomnia" title="Insomnia">sleep</a>, and an <a href="/wiki/Euphoria" title="Euphoria">intense feeling of excitement</a>. Research has indicated that this stage generally lasts from one and a half to three years.</p><p>Since the lust and attraction stages are both considered temporary, a third stage is needed to account for long-term relationships. <a href="/wiki/Attachment_theory" title="Attachment theory">Attachment</a> is the <a href="/wiki/Human_bonding" title="Human bonding">bonding</a> that promotes relationships lasting for many years and even decades. Attachment is generally based on commitments such as <a href="/wiki/Marriage" title="Marriage">marriage</a> and <a href="/wiki/Children" class="mw-redirect" title="Children">children</a>, or on mutual friendship based on things like shared interests. It has been linked to higher levels of the chemicals <a href="/wiki/Oxytocin" title="Oxytocin">oxytocin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vasopressin" title="Vasopressin">vasopressin</a> to a greater degree than short-term relationships have. <a href="/wiki/Enzo_Emanuele" title="Enzo Emanuele">Enzo Emanuele</a> and coworkers reported the protein molecule known as the <a href="/wiki/Nerve_growth_factor" title="Nerve growth factor">nerve growth factor</a> (NGF) has high levels when people first fall in love, but these return to previous levels after one year.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Psychology" title="Psychology">Psychology</a> depicts love as a cognitive and social phenomenon. <a href="/wiki/Psychologist" title="Psychologist">Psychologist</a> <a href="/wiki/Robert_Sternberg" title="Robert Sternberg">Robert Sternberg</a> formulated a <a href="/wiki/Triangular_theory_of_love" title="Triangular theory of love">triangular theory of love</a> and argued that love has three different components: intimacy, commitment, and passion. Intimacy is a form in which two people share confidences and various details of their personal lives, and is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs. Commitment, on the other hand, is the expectation that the relationship is permanent. The last and most common form of love is sexual attraction and passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. All forms of love are viewed as varying combinations of these three components. Non-love does not include any of these components. Liking only includes intimacy. Infatuated love only includes passion. Empty love only includes commitment. Romantic love includes both intimacy and passion. Companionate love includes intimacy and commitment. Fatuous love includes passion and commitment. Lastly, consummate love includes all three. American psychologist <a href="/wiki/Zick_Rubin" title="Zick Rubin">Zick Rubin</a> sought to define <i>love</i> by <a href="/wiki/Psychometrics" title="Psychometrics">psychometrics</a> in the 1970s. His work states that three factors constitute love: attachment, caring, and intimacy. </p><p>Following developments in electrical theories such as <a href="/wiki/Coulomb%27s_law" title="Coulomb&apos;s law">Coulomb&apos;s law</a>, which showed that positive and negative charges attract, analogs in human life were developed, such as &quot;opposites attract.&quot; Over the last century, research on the nature of human mating has generally found this not to be true when it comes to character and personality&#x2014;people tend to like people similar to themselves. However, in a few unusual and specific domains, such as <a href="/wiki/Immune_system" title="Immune system">immune systems</a>, it seems that humans prefer others who are unlike themselves (e.g., with an orthogonal immune system), since this will lead to a baby that has the best of both worlds. In recent years, various <a href="/wiki/Human_bonding" title="Human bonding">human bonding</a> theories have been developed, described in terms of attachments, ties, bonds, and affinities. Some Western authorities disaggregate into two main components, the altruistic and the narcissistic. This view is represented in the works of <a href="/wiki/M._Scott_Peck" title="M. Scott Peck">Scott Peck</a>, whose work in the field of <a href="/wiki/Applied_psychology" title="Applied psychology">applied psychology</a> explored the definitions of love and evil. Peck maintains that love is a combination of the &quot;concern for the spiritual growth of another,&quot; and simple narcissism. In combination, love is an <i>activity</i>, not simply a feeling.</p><p>Psychologist <a href="/wiki/Erich_Fromm" title="Erich Fromm">Erich Fromm</a> maintained in his book <i><a href="/wiki/The_Art_of_Loving" title="The Art of Loving">The Art of Loving</a></i> that love is not merely a feeling but is also actions, and that in fact, the &quot;feeling&quot; of love is superficial in comparison to one&apos;s commitment to love via a series of loving actions over time. In this sense, Fromm held that love is ultimately not a feeling at all, but rather is a commitment to, and adherence to, loving actions towards another, oneself, or many others, over a sustained duration. Fromm also described love as a conscious choice that in its early stages might originate as an involuntary feeling, but which then later no longer depends on those feelings, but rather depends only on conscious commitment.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology" title="Evolutionary psychology">Evolutionary psychology</a> has attempted to provide various reasons for love as a survival tool. Humans are dependent on parental help for a large portion of their lifespans compared to other mammals. Love has therefore been seen as a mechanism to promote parental support of children for this extended time period. Another factor may be that <a href="/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_disease" class="mw-redirect" title="Sexually transmitted disease">sexually transmitted diseases</a> can cause, among other effects, permanently reduced <a href="/wiki/Fertility" title="Fertility">fertility</a>, injury to the fetus, and increase complications during <a href="/wiki/Childbirth" title="Childbirth">childbirth</a>. This would favor monogamous relationships over polygamy.</p><p>Biological models of love tend to see it as a mammalian drive, similar to <a href="/wiki/Hunger" title="Hunger">hunger</a> or <a href="/wiki/Thirst" title="Thirst">thirst</a>. Psychology sees love as more of a social and cultural phenomenon. Certainly love is influenced by <a href="/wiki/Hormone" title="Hormone">hormones</a> (such as <a href="/wiki/Oxytocin" title="Oxytocin">oxytocin</a>), <a href="/wiki/Neurotrophins" class="mw-redirect" title="Neurotrophins">neurotrophins</a> (such as <a href="/wiki/Nerve_growth_factor" title="Nerve growth factor">NGF</a>), and <a href="/wiki/Pheromone" title="Pheromone">pheromones</a>, and how people think and behave in love is influenced by their conceptions of love. The conventional view in <a href="/wiki/Biology" title="Biology">biology</a> is that there are two major drives in love: <a href="/wiki/Sexual_attraction" title="Sexual attraction">sexual attraction</a> and <a href="/wiki/Attachment_theory" title="Attachment theory">attachment</a>. Attachment between adults is presumed to work on the same principles that lead an infant to become attached to its mother. The traditional psychological view sees love as being a combination of <a href="/wiki/Companionate_love" class="mw-redirect" title="Companionate love">companionate love</a> and passionate love. Passionate love is intense longing, and is often accompanied by <a href="/wiki/Physiological_arousal" class="mw-redirect" title="Physiological arousal">physiological arousal</a> (shortness of breath, rapid heart rate); companionate love is affection and a feeling of intimacy not accompanied by physiological arousal.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a> distinguishes <a href="/wiki/Greek_words_for_love" title="Greek words for love">several different senses</a> in which the word &quot;love&quot; is used. Ancient Greeks identified four forms of love: kinship or <a href="/wiki/Familial_love" class="mw-redirect" title="Familial love">familiarity</a> (in <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greek" title="Ancient Greek">Greek</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/Storge" title="Storge">storge</a></i>), <a href="/wiki/Friendship" title="Friendship">friendship</a> and/or <a href="/wiki/Platonic_love" title="Platonic love">platonic desire</a> (<i><a href="/wiki/Philia" title="Philia">philia</a></i>), sexual and/or <a href="/wiki/Romance_(love)" title="Romance (love)">romantic desire</a> (<i><a href="/wiki/Eros_(concept)" title="Eros (concept)">eros</a></i>), and <a href="/wiki/Kenosis" title="Kenosis">self-emptying</a> or divine love (<i><a href="/wiki/Agape" title="Agape">agape</a></i>). Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of romantic love. However, with Greek (as with many other languages), it has been historically difficult to separate the meanings of these words totally. At the same time, the Ancient Greek text of the <a href="/wiki/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a> has examples of the <a href="/wiki/Verb" title="Verb">verb</a> <i>agapo</i> having the same meaning as <i><a href="/wiki/Phileo" class="mw-redirect" title="Phileo">phileo</a></i>.</p><p><i><a href="/wiki/Agap%C4%93" class="mw-redirect" title="Agap&#x113;">Agape</a></i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#x1F00;&#x3B3;&#x3AC;&#x3C0;&#x3B7;</span> <i>ag&#xE1;p&#x113;</i>) means <i>love</i> in modern-day Greek. The term <i>s&apos;agapo</i> means <i>I love you</i> in Greek. The word <i>agapo</i> is the verb <i>I love</i>. It generally refers to a &quot;pure,&quot; <a href="/wiki/Ideal_type" title="Ideal type">ideal type</a> of love, rather than the physical attraction suggested by <i>eros</i>. However, there are some examples of <i>agape</i> used to mean the same as <i>eros</i>. It has also been translated as &quot;love of the soul.&quot;</p><p><i><a href="/wiki/Eros_(love)" class="mw-redirect" title="Eros (love)">Eros</a></i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#x1F14;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3C2;</span> <i>&#xE9;r&#x14D;s</i>) (from the Greek deity <a href="/wiki/Eros" title="Eros">Eros</a>) is passionate love, with sensual desire and longing. The Greek word <i>erota</i> means <i>in love</i>. <a href="/wiki/Plato" title="Plato">Plato</a> refined his own definition. Although eros is initially felt for a person, with contemplation it becomes an appreciation of the beauty within that person, or even becomes appreciation of beauty itself. Eros helps the soul recall knowledge of beauty and contributes to an understanding of spiritual truth. Lovers and philosophers are all inspired to seek truth by eros. Some translations list it as &quot;love of the body.&quot;</p><p><i><a href="/wiki/Philia" title="Philia">Philia</a></i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#x3C6;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3AF;&#x3B1;</span> <i>phil&#xED;a</i>), a dispassionate virtuous love, was a concept addressed and developed by <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>. It includes loyalty to friends, family, and community, and requires virtue, equality, and familiarity. Philia is motivated by practical reasons; one or both of the parties benefit from the relationship.

It was an almost ritualized friendship formed between a host and his guest, who could previously have been strangers. The host fed and provided quarters for the guest, who was expected to repay only with gratitude. The importance of this can be seen throughout <a href="/wiki/Greek_mythology" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a>&#x2014;in particular, <a href="/wiki/Homer" title="Homer">Homer</a>&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/Iliad" title="Iliad">Iliad</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Odyssey" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a></i>.</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin language</a> has several different verbs corresponding to the English word &quot;love.&quot; <i><a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/amo#Latin" class="extiw" title="wikt:amo">am&#x14D;</a></i> is the basic verb meaning <i>I love</i>, with the infinitive <i><a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/amare#Italian" class="extiw" title="wikt:amare">amare</a></i> (&#x201C;to love&#x201D;) as it still is in <a href="/wiki/Italian_language" title="Italian language">Italian</a> today. The Romans used it both in an affectionate sense as well as in a romantic or sexual sense. From this verb come <i>amans</i>&#x2014;a lover, amator, &quot;professional lover,&quot; often with the accessory notion of lechery&#x2014;and <i>amica</i>, &quot;girlfriend&quot; in the English sense, often being applied euphemistically to a prostitute. The corresponding noun is <i>amor</i> (the significance of this term for the Romans is well illustrated in the fact, that the name of the City, <a href="/wiki/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a>&#x2014;in Latin: <i>Roma</i>&#x2014;can be viewed as an <a href="/wiki/Anagram" title="Anagram">anagram</a> for <i>amor</i>, which was used as the secret name of the City in wide circles in ancient times), which is also used in the plural form to indicate love affairs or sexual adventures. This same root also produces <i>amicus</i>&#x2014;&quot;friend&quot;&#x2014;and <i>amicitia</i>, &quot;friendship&quot; (often based to mutual advantage, and corresponding sometimes more closely to &quot;indebtedness&quot; or &quot;influence&quot;). Cicero wrote a treatise called <i>On Friendship</i> (<i>de Amicitia</i>), which discusses the notion at some length. Ovid wrote a guide to dating called <i><a href="/wiki/Ars_Amatoria" title="Ars Amatoria">Ars Amatoria</a></i> (<i>The Art of Love</i>), which addresses, in depth, everything from <a href="/wiki/Affair" title="Affair">extramarital affairs</a> to overprotective parents.</p><p>Latin sometimes uses <i>am&#x101;re</i> where English would simply say <i>to like</i>. This notion, however, is much more generally expressed in Latin by <i>placere</i> or <i>delect&#x101;re</i>, which are used more colloquially, the latter used frequently in the love poetry of <a href="/wiki/Catullus" title="Catullus">Catullus</a>. <i>Diligere</i> often has the notion &quot;to be affectionate for,&quot; &quot;to esteem,&quot; and rarely if ever is used for romantic love. This word would be appropriate to describe the friendship of two men. The corresponding noun <i>diligentia</i>, however, has the meaning of &quot;diligence&quot; or &quot;carefulness,&quot; and has little semantic overlap with the verb. <i>Observare</i> is a synonym for <i>diligere</i>; despite the cognate with English, this verb and its corresponding noun, <i>observantia</i>, often denote &quot;esteem&quot; or &quot;affection.&quot; <i><a href="/wiki/Charity_(virtue)" title="Charity (virtue)">Caritas</a></i> is used in Latin translations of the Christian Bible to mean &quot;charitable love&quot;; this meaning, however, is not found in Classical pagan <a href="/wiki/Latin_literature" title="Latin literature">Roman literature</a>. As it arises from a <a href="/wiki/Conflation" title="Conflation">conflation</a> with a Greek word, there is no corresponding verb.</p><p>Two philosophical underpinnings of love exist in the Chinese tradition, one from <a href="/wiki/Confucianism" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> which emphasized actions and duty while the other came from <a href="/wiki/Mohism" title="Mohism">Mohism</a> which championed a universal love. A core concept to Confucianism is <i><a href="/wiki/Ren_(Confucianism)" title="Ren (Confucianism)">Ren</a></i> (&quot;benevolent love&quot;, <span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x4EC1;</span>), which focuses on duty, action and attitude in a relationship rather than love itself. In Confucianism, one displays benevolent love by performing actions such as <a href="/wiki/Filial_piety" title="Filial piety">filial piety</a> from children, kindness from parent, loyalty to the king and so forth.</p><p>The concept of <i>Ai</i> (<span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x611B;</span>) was developed by the Chinese philosopher <a href="/wiki/Mozi" title="Mozi">Mozi</a> in the 4th century BC in reaction to Confucianism&apos;s benevolent love. Mozi tried to replace what he considered to be the long-entrenched Chinese over-attachment to family and clan structures with the concept of &quot;universal love&quot; (<i>ji&#x101;n&apos;&#xE0;i</i>, <span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x517C;&#x611B;</span>). In this, he argued directly against Confucians who believed that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, by contrast, believed people in principle should care for all people equally. Mohism stressed that rather than adopting different attitudes towards different people, love should be unconditional and offered to everyone without regard to reciprocation, not just to friends, family and other Confucian relations. Later in <a href="/wiki/Chinese_Buddhism" title="Chinese Buddhism">Chinese Buddhism</a>, the term <i>Ai</i> (<span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x611B;</span>) was adopted to refer to a passionate caring love and was considered a fundamental desire. In Buddhism, <i>Ai</i> was seen as capable of being either selfish or selfless, the latter being a key element towards enlightenment.</p><p>In contemporary Chinese, <i>Ai</i> (<span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x611B;</span>) is often used as the equivalent of the Western concept of love. <i>Ai</i> is used as both a verb (e.g. <i>wo ai ni</i> <span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x6211;&#x611B;&#x4F60;</span>, or &quot;I love you&quot;) and a noun (such as <i>aiqing</i> <span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x611B;&#x60C5;</span>, or &quot;romantic love&quot;). However, due to the influence of Confucian <i>Ren</i>, the phrase &apos;Wo ai ni&apos; (I love you) carries with it a very specific sense of responsibility, commitment and loyalty. Instead of frequently saying &quot;I love you&quot; as in some Western societies, the Chinese are more likely to express feelings of affection in a more casual way. Consequently, &quot;I like you&quot; (<i>Wo xihuan ni</i>, <span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x6211;&#x559C;&#x6B22;&#x4F60;</span>) is a more common way of expressing affection in Chinese; it is more playful and less serious. This is also true in Japanese (<i>suki da</i>, <span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">&#x597D;&#x304D;&#x3060;</span>). The Chinese are also more likely to say &quot;I love you&quot; in English or other foreign languages than they would in their mother tongue.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Rumi" title="Rumi">Rumi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hafiz_Shirazi" class="mw-redirect" title="Hafiz Shirazi">Hafiz</a> and <a href="/wiki/Saadi_(poet)" class="mw-redirect" title="Saadi (poet)">Sa&apos;di</a> are icons of the passion and love that the <a href="/wiki/Culture_of_Iran" title="Culture of Iran">Persian culture</a> and language present.

Because &quot;love&quot; covers a wide range of emotions and behavioral phenomena, there are nuances distinguishing the three terms. The term <i>ai</i> <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">&#x611B;</span>)</span>, which is often associated with maternal love or selfless love, originally referred to beauty and was often used in religious context. Following the <a href="/wiki/Meiji_Restoration" title="Meiji Restoration">Meiji Restoration</a> 1868, the term became associated with &quot;love&quot; in order to translate Western literature. Prior to Western influence, the term <i>koi</i> <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">&#x604B;</span>)</span> generally represented romantic love, and was often the subject of the popular <a href="/wiki/Man%27y%C5%8Dsh%C5%AB" title="Man&apos;y&#x14D;sh&#x16B;">Man&apos;y&#x14D;sh&#x16B;</a> Japanese poetry collection. <i>Koi</i> describes a longing for a member of the opposite sex and is typical interpreted as selfish and wanting. The term&apos;s origins come from the concept of lonely solitude as a result of separation from a loved one. Though modern usage of <i>koi</i> focuses on sexual love and infatuation, the Many&#x14D; used the term to cover a wider range of situations, including tenderness, benevolence, and material desire. The third term, <i>ren&apos;ai</i> <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">&#x604B;&#x611B;</span>)</span>, is a more modern construction that combines the <a href="/wiki/Kanji" title="Kanji">kanji</a> characters for both <i>ai</i> and <i>koi</i>, though its usage more closely resembles that of <i>koi</i> in the form of romantic love.</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Turkish_language" title="Turkish language">Turkish</a>, the word &quot;love&quot; comes up with several meanings. A person can love a god, a person, parents, or family. But that person can &quot;love&quot; just one special person, which they call the word &quot;a&#x15F;k.&quot; <i><a href="/wiki/Ishq" title="Ishq">A&#x15F;k</a></i> (a word of Arabic origin) is a feeling for <i>to love,</i> or being &quot;in love&quot; (A&#x15F;&#x131;k), as it still is in Turkish today. The Turks used this word just for their loves in a romantic or sexual sense. If a Turk says that he is in love (A&#x15F;&#x131;k) with somebody, it is not a love that a person can feel for his or her parents; it is just for one person, and it indicates a huge infatuation.

Saint Augustine says the only one who can love you truly and fully is God, because love with a human only allows for flaws such as <i>&#x201C;jealousy, suspicion, fear, anger, and contention.&#x201D;</i> According to Saint Augustine, to love God is <i>&#x201C;to attain the peace which is yours.&#x201D;</i> (Saint Augustine&apos;s Confessions)</p><p>Augustine regards the duplex commandment of love in Matthew 22 as the heart of Christian faith and the interpretation of the Bible.

Since everything is a reflection of God, the school of Sufism practices to see the beauty inside the apparently ugly. Sufism is often referred to as the religion of love. God in Sufism is referred to in three main terms, which are the Lover, Loved, and Beloved, with the last of these terms being often seen in Sufi poetry. A common viewpoint of Sufism is that through love, humankind can get back to its inherent purity and grace.

Gaudiya Vaishnavas who worship Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the cause of all causes consider Love for Godhead (Prema) to act in two ways: sambhoga and vipralambha (union and separation)&#x2014;two opposites .</p><p>In the condition of separation, there is an acute yearning for being with the beloved and in the condition of union there is supreme happiness and nectarean. Gaudiya Vaishnavas consider that Krishna-prema (Love for Godhead) is not fire but that it still burns away one&apos;s material desires. They consider that K&#x1E5B;&#x1E63;&#x1E47;a-prema is not a weapon, but it still pierces the heart. It is not water, but it washes away everything&#x2014;one&apos;s pride, religious rules, and one&apos;s shyness. Krishna-prema is considered to make one drown in the ocean of transcendental ecstasy and pleasure. The love of Radha, a cowherd girl, for Krishna is often cited as the supreme example of love for Godhead by Gaudiya Vaishnavas. Radha is considered to be the internal potency of Krishna, and is the supreme lover of Godhead. Her example of love is considered to be beyond the understanding of material realm as it surpasses any form of selfish love or lust that is visible in the material world. The reciprocal love between Radha (the supreme lover) and Krishna (God as the Supremely Loved) is the subject of many poetic compositions in India such as the <i><a href="/wiki/Gita_Govinda" title="Gita Govinda">Gita Govinda</a></i> and <i>Hari Bhakti Shuddhodhaya.</i></p><p>In the Bhakti tradition within Hinduism, it is believed that execution of devotional service to God leads to the development of Love for God <i>(taiche bhakti-phale krsne prema upajaya)</i>, and as love for God increases in the heart, the more one becomes free from material contamination <i>(krishna-prema asvada haile, bhava nasa paya)</i>. Being perfectly in love with God or Krishna makes one perfectly free from material contamination. and this is the ultimate way of salvation or liberation. In this tradition, salvation or liberation is considered inferior to love, and just an incidental by-product.
