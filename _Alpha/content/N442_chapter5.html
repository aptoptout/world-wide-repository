<p>Google began in January 1996 as a research project by <a href="/wiki/Larry_Page" title="Larry Page">Larry Page</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sergey_Brin" title="Sergey Brin">Sergey Brin</a> when they were both PhD students at <a href="/wiki/Stanford_University" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</a> in <a href="/wiki/Stanford,_California" title="Stanford, California">Stanford, California</a>.</p>
<p>While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, the two theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships between websites. They called this new technology <a href="/wiki/PageRank" title="PageRank">PageRank</a>; it determined a website&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Relevance_(information_retrieval)" title="Relevance (information retrieval)">relevance</a> by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages, that linked back to the original site.</p>
<p>Page and Brin originally nicknamed their new search engine &quot;BackRub&quot;, because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site. Eventually, they changed the name to Google, originating from a misspelling of the word &quot;<a href="/wiki/Googol" title="Googol">googol</a>&quot;, the number one followed by one hundred zeros, which was picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information. Originally, Google ran under Stanford University&apos;s website, with the domains <i>google.stanford.edu</i> and <i>z.stanford.edu</i>.</p>
<p>The domain name for Google was registered on September 15, 1997, and the company was incorporated on September 4, 1998. It was based in the garage of a friend (<a href="/wiki/Susan_Wojcicki" title="Susan Wojcicki">Susan Wojcicki</a>) in <a href="/wiki/Menlo_Park,_California" title="Menlo Park, California">Menlo Park</a>, California. <a href="/w/index.php?title=Craig_Silverstein&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Craig Silverstein (page does not exist)">Craig Silverstein</a>, a fellow PhD student at Stanford, was hired as the first employee.</p>
<p>In May 2011, the number of monthly unique visitors to Google surpassed one billion for the first time, an 8.4&#xA0;percent increase from May 2010 (931&#xA0;million). In January 2013, Google announced it had earned <span style="white-space: nowrap">US$50&#xA0;billion</span> in annual revenue for the year of 2012. This marked the first time the company had reached this feat, topping their 2011 total of $38&#xA0;billion.</p>
<p>The company has reported fourth quarter (Dec 2014) Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $6.88 &#x2013; $0.20 under projections. Revenue came in at $14.5 billion (16.9% growth year over year), also under expectations by $110 million.</p>

<p>The first funding for Google was an August 1998 contribution of $100,000 from <a href="/wiki/Andy_Bechtolsheim" title="Andy Bechtolsheim">Andy Bechtolsheim</a>, co-founder of <a href="/wiki/Sun_Microsystems" title="Sun Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a>, given before Google was incorporated. Early in 1999, while graduate students, Brin and Page decided that the search engine they had developed was taking up too much time and distracting their academic pursuits. They went to <a href="/wiki/Excite" title="Excite">Excite</a> CEO George Bell and offered to sell it to him for $1&#xA0;million. He rejected the offer and later criticized <a href="/wiki/Vinod_Khosla" title="Vinod Khosla">Vinod Khosla</a>, one of Excite&apos;s venture capitalists, after he negotiated Brin and Page down to $750,000. On June 7, 1999, a $25&#xA0;million round of funding was announced, with major investors including the <a href="/wiki/Venture_capital" title="Venture capital">venture capital</a> firms <a href="/wiki/Kleiner_Perkins_Caufield_%26_Byers" title="Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers">Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sequoia_Capital" title="Sequoia Capital">Sequoia Capital</a>.</p>
<p>Google&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Initial_public_offering" title="Initial public offering">initial public offering</a> (IPO) took place five years later on August 19, 2004. At that time Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and <a href="/wiki/Eric_Schmidt" title="Eric Schmidt">Eric Schmidt</a> agreed to work together at Google for 20 years, until the year 2024. The company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share. Shares were sold in an online auction format using a system built by <a href="/wiki/Morgan_Stanley" title="Morgan Stanley">Morgan Stanley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Credit_Suisse" title="Credit Suisse">Credit Suisse</a>, underwriters for the deal. The sale of $1.67 bn (billion) gave Google a <a href="/wiki/Market_capitalization" title="Market capitalization">market capitalization</a> of more than $23bn. By January 2014, its market capitalization had grown to $397bn. The vast majority of the 271&#xA0;million shares remained under the control of Google, and many Google employees became instant paper millionaires. <a href="/wiki/Yahoo!" title="Yahoo!">Yahoo!</a>, a competitor of Google, also benefited because it owned 8.4&#xA0;million shares of Google before the IPO took place.</p>
<p>There were concerns that Google&apos;s IPO would lead to changes in company culture. Reasons ranged from shareholder pressure for employee benefit reductions to the fact that many company executives would become instant paper millionaires. As a reply to this concern, co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page promised in a report to potential investors that the IPO would not change the company&apos;s culture. In 2005, articles in <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> and other sources began suggesting that Google had lost its anti-corporate, no evil philosophy. In an effort to maintain the company&apos;s unique culture, Google designated a Chief Culture Officer, who also serves as the Director of Human Resources. The purpose of the Chief Culture Officer is to develop and maintain the culture and work on ways to keep true to the core values that the company was founded on: a flat organization with a collaborative environment. Google has also faced allegations of <a href="/wiki/Sexism" title="Sexism">sexism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ageism" title="Ageism">ageism</a> from former employees. In 2013, a <a href="/wiki/Hi-Tech_Employee_class_action_lawsuit" class="mw-redirect" title="Hi-Tech Employee class action lawsuit">class action against</a> several Silicon Valley companies, including Google, was filed for alleged &quot;no cold call&quot; agreements which restrained the recruitment of high-tech employees.</p>
<p>The stock performed well after the IPO, with shares hitting $350 for the first time on October 31, 2007, primarily because of strong sales and earnings in the <a href="/wiki/Online_advertising" title="Online advertising">online advertising</a> market. The surge in stock price was fueled mainly by individual investors, as opposed to large institutional investors and <a href="/wiki/Mutual_fund" title="Mutual fund">mutual funds</a>. GOOG shares split into GOOG Class C shares and GOOGL class A shares. The company is listed on the <a href="/wiki/NASDAQ" title="NASDAQ">NASDAQ</a> stock exchange under the <a href="/wiki/Ticker_symbol" title="Ticker symbol">ticker symbols</a> GOOGL and GOOG, and on the <a href="/wiki/Frankfurt_Stock_Exchange" title="Frankfurt Stock Exchange">Frankfurt Stock Exchange</a> under the ticker symbol GGQ1. These ticker symbols now refer to Alphabet Inc., Google&apos;s holding company, since the fourth quarter of 2015.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Growth">Growth</span></h3>
<p>In March 1999, the company moved its offices to <a href="/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California" title="Palo Alto, California">Palo Alto, California</a>, which is home to several prominent <a href="/wiki/Silicon_Valley" title="Silicon Valley">Silicon Valley</a> technology start-ups. The next year, against Page and Brin&apos;s initial opposition toward an advertising-funded search engine, Google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords. In order to maintain an uncluttered page design and increase speed, advertisements were solely text-based. Keywords were sold based on a combination of price bids and click-throughs, with bidding starting at five cents per click.</p>
<p>This model of selling keyword advertising was first pioneered by Goto.com, an <a href="/wiki/Idealab" title="Idealab">Idealab</a> spin-off created by <a href="/wiki/Bill_Gross_(entrepreneur)" title="Bill Gross (entrepreneur)">Bill Gross</a>. When the company changed names to Overture Services, it sued Google over alleged infringements of the company&apos;s pay-per-click and bidding patents. Overture Services would later be bought by Yahoo! and renamed <a href="/wiki/Yahoo!_Search_Marketing" title="Yahoo! Search Marketing">Yahoo! Search Marketing</a>. The case was then settled out of court; Google agreed to issue shares of common stock to Yahoo! in exchange for a perpetual license.</p>
<p>In 2001, Google received a patent for its PageRank mechanism. The patent was officially assigned to Stanford University and lists Lawrence Page as the inventor. In 2003, after outgrowing two other locations, the company leased an office complex from <a href="/wiki/Silicon_Graphics" title="Silicon Graphics">Silicon Graphics</a> at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway in <a href="/wiki/Mountain_View,_California" title="Mountain View, California">Mountain View, California</a>. The complex became known as the <a href="/wiki/Googleplex" title="Googleplex">Googleplex</a>, a play on the word <a href="/wiki/Googolplex" title="Googolplex">googolplex</a>, the number one followed by a googol zeroes. The <a href="/wiki/Googleplex" title="Googleplex">Googleplex</a> interiors were designed by <a href="/wiki/Clive_Wilkinson" title="Clive Wilkinson">Clive Wilkinson</a> Architects. Three years later, Google bought the property from SGI for $319&#xA0;million. By that time, the name &quot;Google&quot; had found its way into everyday language, causing the verb &quot;<a href="/wiki/Google_(verb)" title="Google (verb)">google</a>&quot; to be added to the <a href="/wiki/Merriam-Webster" title="Merriam-Webster">Merriam-Webster</a> Collegiate Dictionary and the <a href="/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary" title="Oxford English Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>, denoted as &quot;to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet&quot;.</p>
<p>The immense popularity of the search engine has led its fans calling themselves &apos;Googlists&apos; as they follow &apos;Googlism&apos;, the new religion. Devotees of Google have found a non-profit online organization The Church of Google, a website where they worship the search engine giant. The New York Times had discussed the topic &quot;Is Google God?&quot; under its &apos;opinion&apos; category.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2013_onward">2013 onward</span></h3>
<p>Google announced the launch of a new company called <a href="/wiki/Calico_(company)" title="Calico (company)">Calico</a> on September 19, 2013, which will be led by Apple chairman <a href="/wiki/Arthur_D._Levinson" title="Arthur D. Levinson">Arthur Levinson</a>. In the official public statement, Page explained that the &quot;health and well-being&quot; company will focus on &quot;the challenge of ageing and associated diseases&quot;.</p>
<p>As of September 2013, Google operates 70 offices in more than 40 countries. Google celebrated its 15-year anniversary on September 27, 2013, although it has used other dates for its official birthday. The reason for the choice of September 27 remains unclear, and a dispute with rival search engine <a href="/wiki/Yahoo!_Search" title="Yahoo! Search">Yahoo! Search</a> in 2005 has been suggested as the cause.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Alliance_for_Affordable_Internet" title="Alliance for Affordable Internet">Alliance for Affordable Internet</a> (A4AI) was launched in October 2013 and Google is part of the coalition of public and private organisations that also includes <a href="/wiki/Facebook" title="Facebook">Facebook</a>, <a href="/wiki/Intel" title="Intel">Intel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Microsoft" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>. Led by <a href="/wiki/Sir_Tim_Berners-Lee" class="mw-redirect" title="Sir Tim Berners-Lee">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a>, the A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online. Google will help to decrease Internet access prices so that they fall below the UN Broadband Commission&apos;s worldwide target of 5% of monthly income.</p>
<p>The corporation&apos;s consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2013 is reported in mid-October 2013 as $14.89 billion, a 12 percent increase compared to the previous quarter. Google&apos;s Internet business was responsible for $10.8 billion of this total, with an increase in the number of users&apos; clicks on advertisements.</p>
<p>In November 2013, Google announced plans for a new 1-million-sq-ft (93,000 sq m) office in London, which is due to open in 2016. The new premises will be able to accommodate 4,500 employees and has been identified as one of the biggest ever commercial property acquisitions in Britain.</p>
<p>In October 2014, according to the <a href="/wiki/Interbrand" title="Interbrand">Interbrand</a> ranking, Google was the second most valuable brand in the world (behind <a href="/wiki/Apple_Inc." title="Apple Inc.">Apple</a>) with a valuation of $107.4 billion. A Millward Brown report from the same year puts the Google brand ahead of Apple&apos;s at #1.</p>

<p>Since 2001, Google has acquired many companies, primarily small venture capital-funded firms. In 2004, Google acquired <a href="/wiki/Keyhole,_Inc" title="Keyhole, Inc">Keyhole, Inc</a>. The start-up company developed a product called Earth Viewer that gave a <a href="/wiki/3D_computer_graphics" title="3D computer graphics">three-dimensional</a> view of the Earth. Google renamed the service to <a href="/wiki/Google_Earth" title="Google Earth">Google Earth</a> in 2005. Google acquired <a href="/wiki/Urchin_(software)" title="Urchin (software)">Urchin Software</a> in April 2005, using their &apos;Urchin on Demand&apos; product (along with ideas from Adaptive Path&apos;s &apos;Measure Map&apos;) to create <a href="/wiki/Google_Analytics" title="Google Analytics">Google Analytics</a> in 2006.</p>
<p>In October 2006, Google announced that it had acquired the video-sharing site YouTube for $1.65&#xA0;billion in Google stock, and the deal was finalized on November 13, 2006. Google does not provide detailed figures for YouTube&apos;s running costs, and YouTube&apos;s revenues in 2007 were noted as &quot;<a href="/wiki/Materiality_(auditing)" title="Materiality (auditing)">not material</a>&quot; in a regulatory filing. In June 2008, a <i><a href="/wiki/Forbes" title="Forbes">Forbes</a></i> magazine article projected the 2008 YouTube revenue at $200&#xA0;million, noting progress in advertising sales.</p>
<p>On April 13, 2007, Google reached an agreement to acquire <a href="/wiki/DoubleClick" title="DoubleClick">DoubleClick</a> for $3.1&#xA0;billion, giving Google valuable relationships that DoubleClick had with Web publishers and advertising agencies. Later that same year, Google purchased <a href="/wiki/GrandCentral" class="mw-redirect" title="GrandCentral">GrandCentral</a> for $50&#xA0;million. The site would later be changed over to <a href="/wiki/Google_Voice" title="Google Voice">Google Voice</a>. On August 5, 2009, Google bought out its first public company, purchasing video software maker <a href="/wiki/On2_Technologies" title="On2 Technologies">On2 Technologies</a> for $106.5&#xA0;million. Google also acquired <a href="/wiki/Aardvark_(search_engine)" title="Aardvark (search engine)">Aardvark</a>, a social network search engine, for $50&#xA0;million, and commented on its internal blog, &quot;we&apos;re looking forward to collaborating to see where we can take it&quot;. In April 2010, Google announced it had acquired a hardware startup, Agnilux.</p>
<p>In addition to the many companies Google has purchased, the company has partnered with other organizations for research, advertising, and other activities. In 2005, Google partnered with <a href="/wiki/NASA" title="NASA">NASA</a> <a href="/wiki/Ames_Research_Center" title="Ames Research Center">Ames Research Center</a> to build 1,000,000 square feet (93,000&#xA0;m) of offices. The offices would be used for research projects involving large-scale data management, <a href="/wiki/Nanotechnology" title="Nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Distributed_computing" title="Distributed computing">distributed computing</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Entrepreneurial_space_industry" class="mw-redirect" title="Entrepreneurial space industry">entrepreneurial space industry</a>. Google entered into a partnership with <a href="/wiki/Sun_Microsystems" title="Sun Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a> in October 2005 to help share and distribute each other&apos;s technologies.</p>
<p>The company also partnered with <a href="/wiki/AOL" title="AOL">AOL</a> to enhance each other&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Video_search" class="mw-redirect" title="Video search">video search</a> services. Google&apos;s 2005 partnerships also included financing the new <a href="/wiki/.mobi" title=".mobi">.mobi</a> <a href="/wiki/Top-level_domain" title="Top-level domain">top-level domain</a> for mobile devices, along with other companies including <a href="/wiki/Microsoft" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nokia" title="Nokia">Nokia</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ericsson" title="Ericsson">Ericsson</a>. Google would later launch &quot;<a href="/wiki/AdSense_for_Mobile" class="mw-redirect" title="AdSense for Mobile">AdSense for Mobile</a>&quot;, taking advantage of the emerging mobile advertising market. Increasing its advertising reach even further, Google and <a href="/wiki/News_Corp._Digital_Media" class="mw-redirect" title="News Corp. Digital Media">Fox Interactive Media</a> of <a href="/wiki/News_Corporation" title="News Corporation">News Corporation</a> entered into a $900&#xA0;million agreement to provide search and advertising on the then-popular social networking site <a href="/wiki/MySpace" class="mw-redirect" title="MySpace">MySpace</a>.</p>
<p>In 2007, Google began sponsoring <a href="/wiki/NORAD_Tracks_Santa" title="NORAD Tracks Santa">NORAD Tracks Santa</a>, displacing former sponsor AOL. NORAD Tracks Santa purports to follow Santa Claus&apos; progress on Christmas Eve, using Google Earth to &quot;track Santa&quot; in 3-D for the first time. Google-owned YouTube gave NORAD Tracks Santa its own channel.</p>
<p>In 2008, Google developed a partnership with <a href="/wiki/GeoEye" title="GeoEye">GeoEye</a> to launch a satellite providing Google with high-resolution (0.41&#xA0;m monochrome, 1.65&#xA0;m color) imagery for Google Earth. The satellite was launched from <a href="/wiki/Vandenberg_Air_Force_Base" title="Vandenberg Air Force Base">Vandenberg Air Force Base</a> on September 6, 2008. Google also announced in 2008 that it was hosting an archive of <a href="/wiki/Life_(magazine)" title="Life (magazine)">Life Magazine</a>&apos;s photographs. Some images in the archive were never published in the magazine. The photos were <a href="/wiki/Watermark" title="Watermark">watermarked</a> and originally had copyright notices posted on all photos, regardless of <a href="/wiki/Public_domain" title="Public domain">public domain</a> status.</p>
<p>In 2010, <a href="/wiki/Google_Energy" title="Google Energy">Google Energy</a> made its first investment in a <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> project, putting $38.8&#xA0;million into two <a href="/wiki/Wind_farm" title="Wind farm">wind farms</a> in <a href="/wiki/North_Dakota" title="North Dakota">North Dakota</a>. The company announced the two locations will generate 169.5&#xA0;megawatts of power, enough to supply 55,000 homes. The farms, which were developed by <a href="/wiki/NextEra_Energy_Resources" title="NextEra Energy Resources">NextEra Energy Resources</a>, will reduce fossil fuel use in the region and return profits. NextEra Energy Resources sold Google a twenty-percent stake in the project to get funding for its development. In February 2010, the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Energy_Regulatory_Commission" title="Federal Energy Regulatory Commission">Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</a> FERC granted Google an authorization to buy and sell energy at market rates. The order specifically states that Google Energy&#x2014;a subsidiary of Google&#x2014;holds the rights &quot;for the sale of energy, capacity, and ancillary services at market-based rates&quot;, but acknowledges that neither Google Energy nor its affiliates &quot;own or control any generation or transmission&quot; facilities. The corporation exercised this authorization in September 2013 when it announced that it will purchase all the electricity produced by the not-yet-built 240-megawatt Happy Hereford wind farm.</p>
<p>Also in 2010, Google purchased <a href="/wiki/Global_IP_Solutions" title="Global IP Solutions">Global IP Solutions</a>, a Norway-based company that provides web-based teleconferencing and other related services. This acquisition enabled Google to add telephone-style services to its list of products. On May 27, 2010, Google announced it had also closed the acquisition of the mobile ad network <a href="/wiki/AdMob" title="AdMob">AdMob</a>. This occurred days after the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission" title="Federal Trade Commission">Federal Trade Commission</a> closed its investigation into the purchase. Google acquired the company for an undisclosed amount. In July 2010, Google signed an agreement with an Iowa wind farm to buy 114 megawatts of energy for 20 years.</p>
<p>On April 4, 2011, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Globe_and_Mail" title="The Globe and Mail">The Globe and Mail</a></i> reported that Google bid $900&#xA0;million for six thousand <a href="/wiki/Nortel_Networks" class="mw-redirect" title="Nortel Networks">Nortel Networks</a> patents.</p>
<p>On August 15, 2011, Google made its largest-ever acquisition to-date when it announced that it would acquire <a href="/wiki/Motorola_Mobility" title="Motorola Mobility">Motorola Mobility</a> for $12.5&#xA0;billion subject to approval from regulators in the United States and Europe. In a post on Google&apos;s blog, Google Chief Executive and co-founder Larry Page revealed that the acquisition was a strategic move to strengthen Google&apos;s patent portfolio. The company&apos;s Android operating system has come under fire in an industry-wide patent battle, as Apple and Microsoft have sued Android device makers such as HTC, Samsung, and Motorola. The merger was completed on May 22, 2012, after the approval of <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China" class="mw-redirect" title="People&apos;s Republic of China">People&apos;s Republic of China</a>.</p>
<p>This purchase was made in part to help Google gain Motorola&apos;s considerable patent portfolio on mobile phones and wireless technologies to help protect it in its ongoing patent disputes with other companies, mainly <a href="/wiki/Apple_Inc." title="Apple Inc.">Apple</a> and <a href="/wiki/Microsoft" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, and to allow it to continue to freely offer <a href="/wiki/Android_(operating_system)" title="Android (operating system)">Android</a>. After the acquisition closed, Google began to restructure the Motorola business to fit Google&apos;s strategy. On August 13, 2012, Google announced plans to lay off 4000 Motorola Mobility employees. On December 10, 2012, Google sold the manufacturing operations of Motorola Mobility to <a href="/wiki/Flextronics" title="Flextronics">Flextronics</a> for $75&#xA0;million. As a part of the agreement, Flextronics will manufacture undisclosed Android and other mobile devices. On December 19, 2012, Google sold the Motorola Home business division of Motorola Mobility to <a href="/wiki/Arris_Group" title="Arris Group">Arris Group</a> for $2.35&#xA0;billion in a cash-and-stock transaction. As a part of this deal, Google acquired a 15.7% stake in Arris Group valued at $300&#xA0;million.</p>
<p>On June 5, 2012, Google announced it acquired <a href="/wiki/Quickoffice" title="Quickoffice">Quickoffice</a>, a company widely known for their mobile productivity suite for both iOS and Android. Google plans to integrate Quickoffice&apos;s technology into its own product suite.</p>
<p>On February 6, 2013, Google announced it had acquired Channel Intelligence for $125&#xA0;million. Channel Intelligence, a technology company that helps customers buy products online, is active globally in 31 different countries and works with over 850 retailers. Google will use this technology to enhance its e-commerce business.</p>
<p>The official confirmation of Google&apos;s acquisition of the Israel-based startup <a href="/wiki/Waze" title="Waze">Waze</a> occurred in June 2013. Waze is promoted as a &quot;community-based traffic and navigation app&quot;.</p>
<p>Following the acquisition of Waze, Google submitted a &quot;10-Q&quot; filing with the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission" title="U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission">Securities Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) that revealed that the corporation spent $1.3 billion on acquisitions during the first half of 2013. The filing also revealed that the Waze acquisition cost Google $966 million, instead of the $1.1 billion figure that was initially presented in media sources.</p>
<p>The 2012 acquisition of WIMM Labs, a company that previously made an Android-powered <a href="/wiki/Smartwatch" title="Smartwatch">smartwatch</a>, was confirmed in August 2013. As of August 31, 2013, Google has not publicly commented on the news concerning WIMM Labs. The acquisition of Flutter, a creator of <a href="/wiki/Gesture_recognition" title="Gesture recognition">hand gesture recognition technology</a>, was confirmed by the corporation in early October 2013. The reported price is $40 million and Google spokesperson stated: &quot;We&apos;re really impressed by the Flutter team&apos;s ability to design new technology based on cutting-edge research.&quot; Flutter&apos;s technology allows users to enact hand gestures to control navigation for apps such as iTunes, Windows Media Player, and Winamp.</p>
<p>On January 26, 2014, Google Inc. announced it had agreed to acquire <a href="/wiki/DeepMind_Technologies" class="mw-redirect" title="DeepMind Technologies">DeepMind Technologies</a>, a privately held artificial intelligence company from <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>. DeepMind describes itself as having the ability to combine the best techniques from machine learning and systems neuroscience to build general-purpose learning algorithms. DeepMind&apos;s first commercial applications were used in simulations, e-commerce and games. As of December 2013, it was reported that DeepMind had roughly 75 employees. The technology news website <a href="/wiki/Re/code" class="mw-redirect" title="Re/code">Re/code</a> reported that the company was purchased for $400 million though it was not disclosed where the information came from. A Google spokesman would not comment of the price. The purchase of DeepMind aids in Google&apos;s recent growth in the artificial intelligence and robotics community.</p>
<p>On January 29, 2014, Google announced it was selling its <a href="/wiki/Motorola_Mobility" title="Motorola Mobility">Motorola Mobility</a> unit to China-based <a href="/wiki/Lenovo" title="Lenovo">Lenovo</a>, for $2.91bn. The company kept the extensive patent collection used to develop Android products, considered the most valuable part of the original deal. Nonetheless, the sale price was significantly less than the $12.5 billion Google had bought Motorola Mobility for. The $2.91bn price tag consisted of $660 million in cash, $750 million in Lenovo ordinary shares, and a $1.5 billion 3-year promissory note.</p>
<p>In March 2014, Google confirmed it had purchased the remnants of gaming startup, Green Throttle Games, which developed a <a href="/wiki/Bluetooth" title="Bluetooth">Bluetooth</a> gaming controller for <a href="/wiki/Android_(operating_system)" title="Android (operating system)">Android</a>.</p>
<p>In May 2014, Google announced it had purchased <a href="/wiki/Quest_Visual" title="Quest Visual">Quest Visual</a>, maker of the augmented reality translator app Word Lens.</p>

<p>In July 2014, Google purchased the online music service <a href="/wiki/Songza" title="Songza">Songza</a>.</p>
<p>On September 10, 2015, Google announced to form strategic partnership with Mobvoi to bring Android Wear to mainland China.</p>
<p>In October 2015, Google invested in a China-based artificial intelligence (AI) company, Mobvoi. The funding will enable the Company to further enhance its core AI technologies, and develop new consumer products empowered by AI.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Google_data_centers">Google data centers</span></h3>
<p>As of 2014, Google Inc. owned and operated six <a href="/wiki/Google_Data_Centers" title="Google Data Centers">Google Data Centers</a> across the U.S., one in Chile, one in Finland, one in Ireland, one in Belgium, one in Singapore and one on Taiwan. In 2011, the company had announced plans to build three data centers at a cost of more than $200&#xA0;million in Asia (<a href="/wiki/Singapore" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>, Hong Kong and <a href="/wiki/Taiwan" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>) and said they would be operational within two years. In December 2013, Google announced that it had scrapped the plan to build a data center in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In October 2013, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Washington_Post" title="The Washington Post">The Washington Post</a></i> reported that the U.S. <a href="/wiki/National_Security_Agency" title="National Security Agency">National Security Agency</a> intercepted communications between Google&apos;s data centers, as part of a program named <a href="/wiki/Muscular_(surveillance_program)" class="mw-redirect" title="Muscular (surveillance program)">MUSCULAR</a>. This wiretapping was made possible because Google did not encrypt data passed inside its own network. Google began encrypting data sent between data centers in 2013.</p>
<p>Google&#x2019;s most efficient data center runs at 95&#xA0;&#xB0;F (35&#xA0;&#xB0;C) using only fresh air cooling, requiring no electrically powered air conditioning; the servers run so hot that humans cannot go near them for extended periods.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Alphabet">Alphabet</span></h3>

<p>For the 2006 fiscal year, the company reported $10.492&#xA0;billion in total advertising revenues and only $112&#xA0;million in licensing and other revenues. In 2011, 96% of Google&apos;s revenue was derived from its advertising programs. In addition to its own algorithms for understanding search requests, Google uses technology from the company <a href="/wiki/DoubleClick" title="DoubleClick">DoubleClick</a>, to project user interest and target advertising to the search context and the user history.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Google_Analytics" title="Google Analytics">Google Analytics</a> allows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by examining click rates for all the links on a page. Google advertisements can be placed on third-party websites in a two-part program. Google&apos;s <a href="/wiki/AdWords" title="AdWords">AdWords</a> allows advertisers to display their advertisements in the Google content network, through either a cost-per-click or cost-per-view scheme. The sister service, Google <a href="/wiki/AdSense" title="AdSense">AdSense</a>, allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked.</p>
<p>One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility of <a href="/wiki/Click_fraud" title="Click fraud">click fraud</a>, which occurs when a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the advertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claimed that approximately 14 to 20&#xA0;percent of clicks were fraudulent or invalid.</p>
<p>In February 2003, Google stopped showing the advertisements of <a href="/wiki/Oceana_(non-profit_group)" title="Oceana (non-profit group)">Oceana</a>, a non-profit organization protesting a major cruise ship&apos;s sewage treatment practices. Google cited its editorial policy at the time, stating &quot;Google does not accept advertising if the ad or site advocates against other individuals, groups, or organizations.&quot; The policy was later changed. In June 2008, Google reached an advertising agreement with Yahoo!, which would have allowed Yahoo! to feature Google advertisements on its web pages. The alliance between the two companies was never completely realized because of <a href="/wiki/Competition_law" title="Competition law">antitrust</a> concerns by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice" title="United States Department of Justice">U.S. Department of Justice</a>. As a result, Google pulled out of the deal in November 2008.</p>
<p>In an attempt to advertise its own products, Google launched a website called Demo Slam, developed to demonstrate <a href="/wiki/Technology_demonstration" title="Technology demonstration">technology demos</a> of <a href="/wiki/List_of_Google_products" title="List of Google products">Google Products</a>.</p>

<p>According to market research published by <a href="/wiki/ComScore" title="ComScore">comScore</a> in November 2009, <a href="/wiki/Google_Search" title="Google Search">Google Search</a> is the dominant search engine in the United States market, with a <a href="/wiki/Market_share" title="Market share">market share</a> of 65.6%. Google indexes billions of web pages, so that users can search for the information they desire through the use of keywords and <a href="/wiki/Operator_(computer_programming)" title="Operator (computer programming)">operators</a>.</p>
<p>In 2003, <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> complained about Google&apos;s indexing, claiming that Google&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Web_cache" title="Web cache">caching</a> of content on its site infringed its copyright for the content. In this case, the United States District Court of <a href="/wiki/Nevada" title="Nevada">Nevada</a> ruled in favor of Google in <i><a href="/wiki/Field_v._Google" class="mw-redirect" title="Field v. Google">Field v. Google</a></i> and <i>Parker v. Google</i>. The publication <a href="/wiki/2600:_The_Hacker_Quarterly" title="2600: The Hacker Quarterly">2600: The Hacker Quarterly</a> has compiled a list of words that the web giant&apos;s new <a href="/wiki/Google_Instant" class="mw-redirect" title="Google Instant">instant search feature</a> will not search.</p>
<p>Google Watch has criticized Google&apos;s PageRank algorithms, saying that they discriminate against new websites and favor established sites. The site has also alleged that there are connections between Google and the <a href="/wiki/National_Security_Agency" title="National Security Agency">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) and the <a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="Central Intelligence Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA).</p>
<p>Google also hosts <a href="/wiki/Google_Books" title="Google Books">Google Books</a>. The company began scanning books and uploading limited previews, and full books where allowed, into its new book search engine. The <a href="/wiki/Authors_Guild" title="Authors Guild">Authors Guild</a>, a group that represents 8,000 U.S. authors, filed a class action suit in a New York City federal court against Google in 2005 over this service. Google replied that it is in compliance with all existing and historical applications of copyright laws regarding books. Google eventually reached a revised settlement in 2009 to limit its scans to books from the U.S., the UK, Australia, and Canada. Furthermore, the Paris Civil Court ruled against Google in late 2009, asking it to remove the works of La Martini&#xE8;re (<a href="/wiki/%C3%89ditions_du_Seuil" title="&#xC9;ditions du Seuil">&#xC9;ditions du Seuil</a>) from its database. In competition with <a href="/wiki/Amazon.com" title="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>, Google sells digital versions of new books.</p>
<p>On July 21, 2010, in response to <a href="/wiki/Bing" title="Bing">Bing</a>, Google updated its image search to display a streaming sequence of <a href="/wiki/Thumbnail" title="Thumbnail">thumbnails</a> that enlarge when pointed at. Though web searches still appear in a batch per page format, on July 23, 2010, dictionary definitions for certain English words began appearing above the linked results for web searches.</p>
<p>The &quot;Hummingbird&quot; update to the Google search engine was announced in September 2013. The update was introduced over the month prior to the announcement and allows users ask the search engine a question in natural language rather than entering keywords into the search box.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Productivity_tools">Productivity tools</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Gmail" title="Gmail">Gmail</a>, a free webmail service provided by Google, was launched as an invitation-only <a href="/wiki/Betaware" class="mw-redirect" title="Betaware">beta program</a> on April 1, 2004, and became available to the public on February 7, 2007. The service was upgraded from beta status on July 7, 2009, at which time it had 146&#xA0;million users monthly. The service was the first online email service with one <a href="/wiki/Gigabyte" title="Gigabyte">gigabyte</a> of storage. It was also the first to keep emails from the same conversation together in one thread, similar to an Internet forum. The service offers over 15&#xA0;GB of free storage, shared with other Google Apps, with additional storage ranging from 20&#xA0;GB to 16&#xA0;TB available for $0.25 per 1&#xA0;GB per year.</p>
<p>Gmail uses <a href="/wiki/Ajax_(programming)" title="Ajax (programming)">AJAX</a>, a programming technique that allows web pages to be interactive without refreshing the browser. <a href="/wiki/Steve_Ballmer" title="Steve Ballmer">Steve Ballmer</a> (Microsoft&apos;s former CEO), <a href="/wiki/Liz_Figueroa" title="Liz Figueroa">Liz Figueroa</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mark_Rasch" title="Mark Rasch">Mark Rasch</a>, and the editors of Google Watch have criticised the privacy of Gmail, but Google claims that mail sent to or from Gmail is never read by a human being beyond the account holder and is only used to improve relevance of advertisements.</p>
<p>In 2004, Google started <a href="/wiki/Open_source" class="mw-redirect" title="Open source">open source</a> software project hosting, called <a href="/wiki/Google_Code" class="mw-redirect" title="Google Code">Google Code</a>, which allows developers to download in-development programs at no charge. <a href="/wiki/Google_Drive" title="Google Drive">Google Drive</a>, another part of Google&apos;s productivity suite, allows users to create, edit, and collaborate on documents in an online environment, similar to <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Word" title="Microsoft Word">Microsoft Word</a>. The service was originally called Writely, but was obtained by Google on March 9, 2006, and was released as an invitation-only preview. On June 6 after the acquisition, Google created an experimental spreadsheet editing program, which was combined with Google Docs on October 10.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Google_for_Work" title="Google for Work">Google for Work</a> is a service from Google that provides customizable enterprise versions of several Google products using a <a href="/wiki/Domain_name" title="Domain name">domain name</a> provided by the customer. It features several <a href="/wiki/Web_application" title="Web application">Web applications</a> with similar functionality to traditional <a href="/wiki/Office_suite" class="mw-redirect" title="Office suite">office suites</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Gmail" title="Gmail">Gmail</a>, <a href="/wiki/Google_Hangouts" title="Google Hangouts">Hangouts</a>, <a href="/wiki/Google_Calendar" title="Google Calendar">Google Calendar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Google_Drive" title="Google Drive">Drive</a>, <a href="/wiki/Google_Docs,_Sheets,_and_Slides" title="Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides">Docs, Sheets, Slides</a>, <a href="/wiki/Google_Groups" title="Google Groups">Groups</a>, <a href="/wiki/Google_News" title="Google News">News</a>, <a href="/wiki/Google_Play" title="Google Play">Play</a>, <a href="/wiki/Google_Sites" title="Google Sites">Sites</a>, and Vault. It was the vision of <a href="/wiki/Rajen_Sheth" title="Rajen Sheth">Rajen Sheth</a>, a Google employee who later developed Chromebooks.</p>
<p>Currently, the company is testing a travel app called &quot;Trips&quot;.</p>

<p>On <i><a href="/wiki/Fortune_(magazine)" title="Fortune (magazine)">Fortune</a></i> magazine&apos;s list of the best companies to work for, Google ranked first in 2007, 2008 and 2012 and fourth in 2009 and 2010. Google was also nominated in 2010 to be the world&apos;s most attractive employer to graduating students in the Universum Communications talent attraction index. Google&apos;s corporate philosophy includes principles such as &quot;you can make money without doing evil,&quot; &quot;you can be serious without a suit,&quot; and &quot;work should be challenging and the challenge should be fun.&quot;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Employees">Employees</span></h3>
<p>As of 2013, Google had 47,756 employees (in the fourth quarter, including the Motorola subsidiary), among them more than 10,000 software developers based in more than 40 offices.</p>
<p>After the company&apos;s IPO in 2004, founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page and CEO Eric Schmidt requested that their <a href="/wiki/One-dollar_salary" title="One-dollar salary">base salary be cut to $1</a>. Subsequent offers by the company to increase their salaries were turned down, primarily because their main compensation continues to come from owning stock in Google. Before 2004, Schmidt made $250,000 per year, and Page and Brin each received an annual salary of $150,000.</p>
<p>In 2007 and early 2008, several top executives left Google. In October 2007, former chief financial officer of YouTube Gideon Yu joined <a href="/wiki/Facebook" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> along with Benjamin Ling, a high-ranking engineer. In March 2008, <a href="/wiki/Sheryl_Sandberg" title="Sheryl Sandberg">Sheryl Sandberg</a>, then vice-president of global online sales and operations, began her position as chief operating officer of Facebook. At the same time, Ash ElDifrawi, formerly head of brand advertising, left to become chief marketing officer of <a href="/wiki/Hayneedle" title="Hayneedle">Netshops</a>. On April 4, 2011, Larry Page became CEO and Eric Schmidt became Executive Chairman of Google.

<p><span id="Innovation_Time_Off"></span>As a motivation technique, Google uses a policy often called Innovation Time Off, where Google engineers are encouraged to spend 20% of their work time on projects that interest them. Some of Google&apos;s newer services, such as Gmail, Google News, Orkut, and AdSense originated from these independent endeavors. In a talk at Stanford University, <a href="/wiki/Marissa_Mayer" title="Marissa Mayer">Marissa Mayer</a>, Google&apos;s Vice President of Search Products and User Experience until July 2012, showed that half of all new product launches in the second half of 2005 had originated from the Innovation Time Off.</p>

<p>In October 2006, the company announced plans to install thousands of <a href="/wiki/Solar_panel" title="Solar panel">solar panels</a> to provide up to 1.6&#xA0;mega<a href="/wiki/Watt" title="Watt">watts</a> of electricity, enough to satisfy approximately 30% of the campus&apos; energy needs. The system will be the largest <a href="/wiki/Rooftop_photovoltaic_power_station" title="Rooftop photovoltaic power station">solar power system</a> constructed on a U.S. corporate campus and one of the largest on any corporate site in the world. In addition, Google announced in 2009 that it was deploying herds of <a href="/wiki/Goats" class="mw-redirect" title="Goats">goats</a> to keep grassland around the Googleplex short, helping to prevent the threat from seasonal bush fires while also reducing the <a href="/wiki/Carbon_footprint" title="Carbon footprint">carbon footprint</a> of mowing the extensive grounds. The idea of trimming lawns using goats originated from <a href="/wiki/Bob_Widlar" title="Bob Widlar">Bob Widlar</a>, an engineer who worked for <a href="/wiki/National_Semiconductor" title="National Semiconductor">National Semiconductor</a>. In 2008, Google faced accusations in <i><a href="/wiki/Harper%27s_Magazine" title="Harper&apos;s Magazine">Harper&apos;s Magazine</a></i> of being an &quot;energy glutton&quot;. The company was accused of employing its &quot;<a href="/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil" title="Don&apos;t be evil">Don&apos;t be evil</a>&quot; motto and its public <a href="/wiki/Energy-saving" class="mw-redirect" title="Energy-saving">energy-saving</a> campaigns to cover up or make up for the massive amounts of energy its servers require.</p>
<p>On May 12, 2015, Google announced the setting up of its largest campus outside the United States in Hyderabad, India. The proposed campus can accommodate 6500 employees.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Doodles">Doodles</span></h3>

<p>Since 1998, Google has been designing special, temporary alternate logos to place on their <a href="/wiki/Homepage" class="mw-redirect" title="Homepage">homepage</a> intended to celebrate <a href="/wiki/Holiday" title="Holiday">holidays</a>, events, achievements and people. The first Google <a href="/wiki/Doodle" title="Doodle">Doodle</a> was in honor of the <a href="/wiki/Burning_Man" title="Burning Man">Burning Man Festival</a> of 1998. The doodle was designed by <a href="/wiki/Larry_Page" title="Larry Page">Larry Page</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sergey_Brin" title="Sergey Brin">Sergey Brin</a> to notify users of their absence in case the servers crashed.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Easter_eggs_and_April_Fools.27_Day_jokes">Easter eggs and April Fools&apos; Day jokes</span></h3>

<p>Google has a tradition of creating <a href="/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day" title="April Fools&apos; Day">April Fools&apos; Day</a> jokes. On April 1, 2000, <a href="/wiki/Google%27s_hoaxes#2000" class="mw-redirect" title="Google&apos;s hoaxes">Google MentalPlex</a> allegedly featured the use of mental power to search the web. In 2007, Google announced a free Internet service called <a href="/wiki/TiSP" class="mw-redirect" title="TiSP">TiSP</a>, or Toilet Internet Service Provider, where one obtained a connection by flushing one end of a <a href="/wiki/Optical_fiber" title="Optical fiber">fiber-optic</a> cable down their toilet. Also in 2007, Google&apos;s Gmail page displayed an announcement for <a href="/wiki/Gmail_Paper" class="mw-redirect" title="Gmail Paper">Gmail Paper</a>, allowing users to have email messages printed and shipped to them. In 2008, Google announced Gmail Custom time where users could change the time that the email was sent.</p>
<p>In 2010, Google changed its company name to Topeka in honor of <a href="/wiki/Topeka,_Kansas" title="Topeka, Kansas">Topeka, Kansas</a>, whose mayor changed the city&apos;s name to Google for a short amount of time in an attempt to sway Google&apos;s decision in its new <a href="/wiki/Google_Fiber" title="Google Fiber">Google Fiber Project</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Philanthropy">Philanthropy</span></h3>

<p>In 2004, Google formed the not-for-profit philanthropic <a href="/wiki/Google.org" title="Google.org">Google.org</a>, with a start-up fund of $1&#xA0;billion. The mission of the organization is to create awareness about <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a>, global public health, and global poverty. One of its first projects was to develop a viable <a href="/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid" title="Plug-in hybrid">plug-in hybrid</a> <a href="/wiki/Electric_vehicle" title="Electric vehicle">electric vehicle</a> that can attain 100 miles per gallon. Google hired <a href="/wiki/Larry_Brilliant" title="Larry Brilliant">Larry Brilliant</a> as the program&apos;s executive director in 2004, and the current director is Megan Smith.</p>
<p>In 2008, Google announced its &quot;project 10&quot; which accepted ideas for how to help the community and then allowed Google users to vote on their favorites. After two years of silence, during which many wondered what had happened to the program, Google revealed the winners of the project, giving a total of ten million dollars to various ideas ranging from non-profit organizations that promote education to a website that intends to make all legal documents public and online.</p>
<p>In 2011, Google donated 1&#xA0;million euros to <a href="/wiki/International_Mathematical_Olympiad" title="International Mathematical Olympiad">International Mathematical Olympiad</a> to support the next five annual International Mathematical Olympiads (2011&#x2013;2015). On July 2012, Google launched a &quot;<a href="/wiki/Legalize_Love" class="mw-redirect" title="Legalize Love">Legalize Love</a>&quot; campaign in support of <a href="/wiki/Gay_rights" class="mw-redirect" title="Gay rights">gay rights</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tax_avoidance">Tax avoidance</span></h3>
<p>Google uses various <a href="/wiki/Tax_avoidance" title="Tax avoidance">tax avoidance strategies</a>. Out of the <a href="/wiki/List_of_the_largest_information_technology_companies" title="List of the largest information technology companies">five largest American technology companies</a>, it pays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues. The company accomplishes this partly by licensing technology through <a href="/wiki/Shell_corporation" title="Shell corporation">shell subsidiaries</a> in <a href="/wiki/Tax_haven" title="Tax haven">Ireland, Bermuda, the Bahamas, and the Netherlands</a>. This has reportedly sparked a French investigation into Google&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Transfer_pricing" title="Transfer pricing">transfer pricing</a> practices.</p>
<p>Following criticism of the amount of corporate taxes that Google paid in the United Kingdom, Chairman Eric Schmidt said, &quot;It&apos;s called capitalism. We are proudly capitalistic.&quot; During the same December 2012 interview, Schmidt &quot;confirmed that the company had no intention of paying more to the UK exchequer.&quot; In 2013, Schmidt responded to questions about taxes paid in the UK by pointing to the advertising fees Google charged UK companies as a source of economic growth.</p>
<p>Google Vice President <a href="/wiki/Matt_Brittin" title="Matt Brittin">Matt Brittin</a> testified to the <a href="/wiki/Public_Accounts_Committee_(United_Kingdom)" title="Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)">Public Accounts Committee</a> of the UK House of Commons that his UK sales team made no sales and hence owed no sales taxes to the UK. In January 2016, Google reached a settlement with the UK to pay &#xA3;130m in back taxes plus higher taxes in future.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Environment">Environment</span></h3>
<p>Since 2007, Google has aimed for carbon neutrality in regard to its operations. Google disclosed in September 2011 that it &quot;continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes&quot;, almost 260 million watts or about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant. Total carbon emissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, most due to fossil fuels that provide electricity for the data centers. Google said that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels in 2010. An average search uses only 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, so all global searches are only 12.5 million watts or 5% of the total electricity consumption by Google.</p>
<p>In June 2013, <i>The Washington Post</i> reported that Google had donated $50,000 to the <a href="/wiki/Competitive_Enterprise_Institute" title="Competitive Enterprise Institute">Competitive Enterprise Institute</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Libertarianism" title="Libertarianism">libertarian</a> <a href="/wiki/Think_tank" title="Think tank">think tank</a> that calls human carbon emissions a positive factor in the environment and argues that global warming is not a concern.</p>
<p>In July 2013, it was reported that Google had hosted a fundraising event for Oklahoma Senator <a href="/wiki/Jim_Inhofe" title="Jim Inhofe">Jim Inhofe</a>, who has called climate change a &quot;hoax&quot;. In 2014 Google cut ties with the <a href="/wiki/American_Legislative_Exchange_Council" title="American Legislative Exchange Council">American Legislative Exchange Council</a> (ALEC) after pressure from the Sierra Club, major unions and Google&apos;s own scientists because of ALEC&apos;s stance on climate change and opposition to renewable energy.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Lobbying">Lobbying</span></h3>
<p>In 2013, Google ranked 5th in <a href="/wiki/Lobbying_in_the_United_States" title="Lobbying in the United States">lobbying</a> spending, up from 213th in 2003. In 2012, the company ranked 2nd in campaign donations of technology and Internet sections.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Litigation">Litigation</span></h3>

<p>Google has been involved in a number of lawsuits including the <a href="/wiki/High-Tech_Employee_Antitrust_Litigation" title="High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation">High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation</a> which resulted in Google being one of four companies to pay a $415 million settlement to employees.</p>
