<p>The <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> (EU) comprises 28 <b>member states</b>. Each member state is party to the <a href="/wiki/Treaties_of_the_European_Union" title="Treaties of the European Union">founding treaties</a> of the union and thereby subject to the privileges and obligations of membership. Unlike members of most <a href="/wiki/Intergovernmental_organization" title="Intergovernmental organization">international organisations</a>, the member states of the EU are subjected to binding laws in exchange for representation within the common legislative and judicial institutions. Member states must agree unanimously for the EU to adopt policies concerning defence and foreign affairs. <a href="/wiki/Subsidiarity" title="Subsidiarity">Subsidiarity</a> is a founding principle of the EU.</p><p>In 1957 <a href="/wiki/Inner_Six" title="Inner Six">six core states</a> founded the EU&apos;s predecessor, the <a href="/wiki/European_Economic_Community" title="European Economic Community">European Economic Community</a> (<a href="/wiki/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>, <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Luxembourg" title="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> and <a href="/wiki/West_Germany" title="West Germany">West Germany</a>). The remaining states have acceded in subsequent <a href="/wiki/Enlargement_of_the_European_Union" title="Enlargement of the European Union">enlargements</a>. On 1 July 2013 <a href="/wiki/Croatia" title="Croatia">Croatia</a> became the newest member state of the EU. In order to accede, a state must fulfill the economic and political requirements known as the <a href="/wiki/Copenhagen_criteria" title="Copenhagen criteria">Copenhagen criteria</a>, which require a candidate to have a <a href="/wiki/Democracy" title="Democracy">democratic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Free_market" title="Free market">free market</a> government together with the corresponding freedoms and institutions, and respect for the <a href="/wiki/Rule_of_law" title="Rule of law">rule of law</a>. Enlargement of the Union is also contingent upon the consent of all existing members and the candidate&apos;s adoption of the existing body of EU law, known as the <a href="/wiki/Acquis_communautaire" title="Acquis communautaire">acquis communautaire</a>.</p><p>There is disparity in the size, wealth and political system of member states, but all have equal rights. While in some areas majority voting takes place where larger states have more votes than smaller ones, smaller states have disproportional representation compared to their population. No member state has withdrawn or been suspended from the EU, though some dependent territories or semi-autonomous areas have left.</p><p>Enlargement is, and has been, a principal feature of the Union&apos;s political landscape. The EU&apos;s predecessors were founded by the &quot;<a href="/wiki/Inner_Six" title="Inner Six">Inner Six</a>&quot;, those countries willing to forge ahead with the Community while others remained skeptical. It was only a decade before the first countries changed their policy and attempted to join the Union, which led to the first skepticism of enlargement. <a href="/wiki/French_President" class="mw-redirect" title="French President">French President</a> <a href="/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle" title="Charles de Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a> feared British membership would be an American <a href="/wiki/Trojan_horse" class="mw-redirect" title="Trojan horse">Trojan horse</a> and vetoed its application. It was only after de Gaulle left office and a 12-hour talk by British Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Edward_Heath" title="Edward Heath">Edward Heath</a> and French President <a href="/wiki/Georges_Pompidou" title="Georges Pompidou">Georges Pompidou</a> took place that the United Kingdom&apos;s third application succeeded in 1970.</p><p>Applying in 1969 were the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark, and <a href="/wiki/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a>. Norway, however, declined to accept the invitation to become a member when the electorate voted against it, leaving just the UK, Ireland and Denmark to join. But despite the setbacks, and the withdrawal of <a href="/wiki/Greenland" title="Greenland">Greenland</a> from Denmark&apos;s membership in 1985, three more countries joined the Communities before the end of the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>. In 1987, the geographical extent of the project was tested when <a href="/wiki/Morocco" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> applied, and was rejected as it was not considered a European country.</p><p>1990 saw the Cold War drawing to a close, and <a href="/wiki/East_Germany" title="East Germany">East Germany</a> was welcomed into the Community as part of a reunited Germany. Shortly after, the previously neutral countries of Austria, Finland and Sweden acceded to the new European Union, though <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, which applied in 1992, froze its application due to opposition from voters while Norway, which had applied once more, had its voters reject membership again. Meanwhile, the members of the former <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Bloc" title="Eastern Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a> and <a href="/wiki/Yugoslavia" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> were all starting to move towards EU membership. Ten of these joined in a major enlargement on 1 May 2004 symbolising the unification of East and Western Europe in the EU. Bulgaria and Romania joined in 2007.</p><p>2013 saw the latest member, <a href="/wiki/Croatia" title="Croatia">Croatia</a>, accede to the Union, and the EU has prioritised membership for the rest of the <a href="/wiki/Balkans" title="Balkans">Balkans</a> - namely <a href="/wiki/Western_Balkans" class="mw-redirect" title="Western Balkans">Western Balkans</a>. <a href="/wiki/Albania" title="Albania">Albania</a>, <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Macedonia" title="Republic of Macedonia">Macedonia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Montenegro" title="Montenegro">Montenegro</a>, <a href="/wiki/Serbia" title="Serbia">Serbia</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> are all formal, acknowledged candidates. <a href="/wiki/Accession_of_Turkey_to_the_European_Union" title="Accession of Turkey to the European Union">Turkish membership</a>, pending since the 1980s, is a more contentious issue but it entered negotiations in 2005.</p><p>According to the <a href="/wiki/Copenhagen_criteria" title="Copenhagen criteria">Copenhagen criteria</a>, membership of the European Union is open to any European country that is a stable, <a href="/wiki/Free_market" title="Free market">free market</a> <a href="/wiki/Liberal_democracy" title="Liberal democracy">liberal democracy</a> that respects the <a href="/wiki/Rule_of_law" title="Rule of law">rule of law</a> and <a href="/wiki/Human_rights" title="Human rights">human rights</a>. Furthermore, it has to be willing to accept all the obligations of membership, such as adopting all previously agreed law (the 170,000 pages of <a href="/wiki/Acquis_communautaire" title="Acquis communautaire">acquis communautaire</a>) and switching to the <a href="/wiki/Euro" title="Euro">euro</a>. In addition to enlargement by adding new countries, the EU can also expand by having territories of member states, which are outside the EU, integrate more closely (for example in respect to the <a href="/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Netherlands_Antilles" title="Dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles">dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles</a>) or by a territory of a member state which had previously seceded and then rejoined (see withdrawal below).</p><p>Each state has representation in the <a href="/wiki/Institutions_of_the_European_Union" title="Institutions of the European Union">institutions of the European Union</a>. Full membership gives the government of a member state a seat in the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_the_European_Union" title="Council of the European Union">Council of the European Union</a> and <a href="/wiki/European_Council" title="European Council">European Council</a>. When decisions are not being taken by <a href="/wiki/Consensus" class="mw-redirect" title="Consensus">consensus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Weighted_voting" title="Weighted voting">votes are weighted</a> so that a country with a greater population has more votes within the Council than a smaller country (although not exact, smaller countries have more votes than their population would allow relative to the largest countries). The <a href="/wiki/Presidency_of_the_Council_of_the_European_Union" title="Presidency of the Council of the European Union">Presidency of the Council of the European Union</a> rotates between each of the member states, allowing each state six months to help direct the agenda of the EU.</p><p>Similarly, each state is assigned <a href="/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament" title="Member of the European Parliament">seats in Parliament</a> according to their population (again, with the smaller countries receiving more seats per inhabitant than the larger ones). The members of the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a> have been elected by <a href="/wiki/Universal_suffrage" title="Universal suffrage">universal suffrage</a> since 1979 (before that, they were seconded from <a href="/wiki/National_parliaments_of_the_European_Union" title="National parliaments of the European Union">national parliaments</a>).</p><p>The national governments appoint one member each to the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" title="European Commission">European Commission</a> (in accord with <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_European_Commission" title="President of the European Commission">its president</a>), the <a href="/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice" title="European Court of Justice">European Court of Justice</a> (in accord with other members) and the <a href="/wiki/European_Court_of_Auditors" title="European Court of Auditors">European Court of Auditors</a>. Historically, larger member states were granted an extra Commissioner. However, as the body grew, this right has been removed and each state is represented equally. The six largest states are also granted an Advocates General in the Court of Justice. Finally, the Governing Council of the <a href="/wiki/European_Central_Bank" title="European Central Bank">European Central Bank</a> includes the governors of the national central banks (who may or may not be government appointed) of each <a href="/wiki/Eurozone" title="Eurozone">euro area</a> country.</p><p>The larger states traditionally carry more weight in negotiations, however smaller states can be effective impartial mediators and citizens of smaller states are often appointed to sensitive top posts to avoid competition between the larger states. This, together with the disproportionate representation of the smaller states in terms of votes and seats in parliament, gives the smaller EU states a greater clout than normally attributed to a state of their size. However most negotiations are still dominated by the larger states. This has traditionally been largely through the &quot;<a href="/wiki/France%E2%80%93Germany_relations" title="France&#x2013;Germany relations">Franco-German</a> motor&quot; but Franco-German influence has diminished slightly following the <a href="/wiki/2004_enlargement_of_the_European_Union" title="2004 enlargement of the European Union">influx of new members in 2004</a> (see <a href="/wiki/G6_(EU)" title="G6 (EU)">G6</a>).</p><p>While the member states are sovereign, the union partially follows a <a href="/wiki/Supranational_union" title="Supranational union">supranational</a> system that is comparable to <a href="/wiki/Federalism" title="Federalism">federalism</a>. Previously limited to <a href="/wiki/European_Community" class="mw-redirect" title="European Community">European Community</a> matters, the practice, known as the &quot;community method&quot;, is currently used in most areas of policy. <i>Combined sovereignty</i> is delegated by each member to the institutions in return for representation within those institutions. This practice is often referred to as &quot;pooling of sovereignty&quot;. Those institutions are then empowered to make laws and execute them at a European level.</p><p>If a state fails to comply with the <a href="/wiki/Law_of_the_European_Union" class="mw-redirect" title="Law of the European Union">law of the European Union</a>, it may be fined or have funds withdrawn.</p><p>In contrast to other organisations, the EU&apos;s style of integration has &quot;become a highly developed system for mutual interference in each other&apos;s domestic affairs&quot;. However, on defence and foreign policy issues (and, pre-<a href="/wiki/Lisbon_Treaty" class="mw-redirect" title="Lisbon Treaty">Lisbon Treaty</a>, police and judicial matters) less sovereignty is transferred, with issues being dealt with by unanimity and cooperation. Very early on in the history of the EU, the unique state of its establishment and pooling of sovereignty was emphasised by the Court of Justice:</p><p>By creating a Community of unlimited duration, having its own institutions, its own personality, its own legal capacity and capacity of representation on the international plane and, more particularly, real powers stemming from a limitation of sovereignty or a transfer of powers from the States to Community, the Member States have limited their sovereign rights and have thus created a body of law which binds both their nationals and themselves...The transfer by the States from their domestic legal system to the Community legal system of the rights and obligations arising under the Treaty carries with it a permanent limitation of their sovereign rights.</p><p>Yet, as sovereignty still originates from the national level, it may be withdrawn by a member state who wishes to leave. Hence, if a law is agreed that is not to the liking of a state, it may withdraw from the EU to avoid it. This however has not happened as the benefits of membership are often seen to outweigh the potentially negative impact of a specific law.</p><p>The question of <a href="/wiki/Supremacy_(European_Union_law)" class="mw-redirect" title="Supremacy (European Union law)">whether EU law is superior to national law</a> is subject to some debate. The treaties do not give a judgement on the matter but court judgements have established EU&apos;s law superiority over national law and it is affirmed in a declaration attached to the Treaty of Lisbon (the <a href="/wiki/European_Constitution" class="mw-redirect" title="European Constitution">European Constitution</a> would have fully enshrined this). Some national legal systems also explicitly accept the Court of Justice&apos;s interpretation, such as France and Italy, however in Poland it does not override the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Republic_of_Poland" class="mw-redirect" title="Constitution of the Republic of Poland">national constitution</a>, which it does in Germany. The exact areas where the member states have given legislative competence to the EU are as follows. Every area not mentioned remains with member states.</p><p>As a result of the <a href="/wiki/European_sovereign_debt_crisis" class="mw-redirect" title="European sovereign debt crisis">European sovereign debt crisis</a>, some <a href="/wiki/Eurozone" title="Eurozone">eurozone</a> states required a <a href="/wiki/Bailout" title="Bailout">bailout</a> from the EU via the <a href="/wiki/European_Financial_Stability_Facility" title="European Financial Stability Facility">European Financial Stability Facility</a> and <a href="/wiki/European_Financial_Stability_Mechanism" class="mw-redirect" title="European Financial Stability Mechanism">European Financial Stability Mechanism</a> (to be replaced by the <a href="/wiki/European_Stability_Mechanism" title="European Stability Mechanism">European Stability Mechanism</a> from 2013). In exchange for their bailout, Greece was required to accept a large austerity plan including privatisations and a sell off of state assets. In order to ensure that Greece complies with the EU&apos;s demands, a &quot;large-scale technical assistance&quot; from the European Commission and other member states has been deployed to Greek government ministries. Some, including the <a href="/wiki/Euro_Group#President" class="mw-redirect" title="Euro Group">President of the Euro Group</a> <a href="/wiki/Jean-Claude_Juncker" title="Jean-Claude Juncker">Jean-Claude Juncker</a>, state that &quot;the sovereignty of Greece will be massively limited.&quot; The situation of the bailed out countries (Greece, Portugal and Ireland) has been described as being a <a href="/wiki/Ward_(law)" title="Ward (law)">ward</a> or <a href="/wiki/Protectorate" title="Protectorate">protectorate</a> of the EU with some such as the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> calling for a formalisation of the situation.</p><p>A number of states are less integrated into the EU than others. In most cases this is because those states have gained an <a href="/wiki/Opt-outs_in_the_European_Union" title="Opt-outs in the European Union">opt-out</a> from a certain policy area. The most notable is the opt-out from the <a href="/wiki/Economic_and_Monetary_Union_of_the_European_Union" title="Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union">Economic and Monetary Union</a>, the adoption of the <a href="/wiki/Euro" title="Euro">euro</a> as sole legal currency. Most states outside the <a href="/wiki/Eurozone" title="Eurozone">Eurozone</a> are obliged to adopt the euro when they are ready, but Denmark and the United Kingdom have obtained the right to retain their <a href="/wiki/Currencies_of_the_European_Union" title="Currencies of the European Union">own independent currencies</a>.</p><p>Ireland and the United Kingdom also do not participate in the <a href="/wiki/Schengen_Agreement" title="Schengen Agreement">Schengen Agreement</a>, which eliminates internal EU border checks. Denmark has an opt out from the <a href="/wiki/Common_Security_and_Defence_Policy" title="Common Security and Defence Policy">Common Security and Defence Policy</a>; Denmark, Ireland and the UK have an opt-out on police and justice matters and Poland and the UK have an opt out from the <a href="/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union" title="Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union">Charter of Fundamental Rights</a>.</p><p>There are a number of overseas member state territories which are legally part of the EU, but have certain exemptions based on their remoteness. These &quot;outermost regions&quot; have partial application of EU law and in some cases are outside of Schengen or the EU VAT area&#x2014;however they are legally within the EU. They all use the <a href="/wiki/Euro" title="Euro">euro</a> as their currency.</p><p>Entry to the EU is limited to liberal democracies and <a href="/wiki/Freedom_House" title="Freedom House">Freedom House</a> ranks all EU states as being totally free electoral democracies. All but 4 are ranked at the top 1.0 rating. However, the exact political system of a state is not limited, with each state having its own system based on its historical evolution.</p><p>The majority of member states&#x2014;17 out of 28&#x2014;are <a href="/wiki/Parliamentary_republic" title="Parliamentary republic">parliamentary republics</a>, while seven states are <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchies</a>, meaning they have a <a href="/wiki/Monarch" title="Monarch">monarch</a> although political powers are exercised by elected politicians. Most republics and all the monarchies operate a <a href="/wiki/Parliamentary_system" title="Parliamentary system">parliamentary system</a> whereby the head of state (president or monarch) has a largely ceremonial role with <a href="/wiki/Reserve_power" title="Reserve power">reserve powers</a>. That means most power is in the hands of what is called in most of those countries the <a href="/wiki/Prime_minister" title="Prime minister">prime minister</a>, who is accountable to the <a href="/wiki/National_parliaments_of_the_European_Union" title="National parliaments of the European Union">national parliament</a>. Of the remaining republics, three operate a <a href="/wiki/Semi-presidential_system" title="Semi-presidential system">semi-presidential system</a>, where competencies are shared between the president and <a href="/wiki/Prime_minister" title="Prime minister">prime minister</a>, while one republic operates a <a href="/wiki/Presidential_system" title="Presidential system">presidential system</a>, where the <a href="/wiki/President" title="President">president</a> is head of state and government.</p><p>The EU is divided between <a href="/wiki/Unicameral" class="mw-redirect" title="Unicameral">unicameral</a> (single chamber) and <a href="/wiki/Bicameral" class="mw-redirect" title="Bicameral">bicameral</a> (dual chamber) parliaments, with 15 unicameral national parliaments and 13 bicameral parliaments. The prime minister and government are usually directly accountable to the directly-elected <a href="/wiki/Lower_house" title="Lower house">lower house</a> and require its support to stay in office&#x2014;the exception being Cyprus with its presidential system. <a href="/wiki/Upper_house" title="Upper house">Upper houses</a> are composed differently in different member states: it can be directly elected like the <a href="/wiki/Senate_of_Poland" title="Senate of Poland">Polish senate</a>, indirectly elected, for example, by regional legislatures like the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Council_of_Austria" class="mw-redirect" title="Federal Council of Austria">Federal Council of Austria</a>, unelected, but representing certain interest groups like the <a href="/wiki/National_Council_of_Slovenia" class="mw-redirect" title="National Council of Slovenia">National Council of Slovenia</a>, unelected (though by and large appointed by elected officials) as a remnant of a non-democratic political system in earlier times (as in the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Lords" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> in the United Kingdom). Most (though not all) elections in the EU use some form of <a href="/wiki/Proportional_representation" title="Proportional representation">proportional representation</a>. The most common type of proportional representation is the <a href="/wiki/Party-list_proportional_representation" title="Party-list proportional representation">party-list system</a>.</p><p>There are also differences in the level of <a href="/wiki/Self-governance" title="Self-governance">self-governance</a> for the sub-regions of a member state. Most states, especially the smaller ones, are <a href="/wiki/Unitary_state" title="Unitary state">unitary states</a>; meaning all major political power is concentrated at the national level. 10 states allocate power to more local levels of government. Austria, Belgium and Germany are full <a href="/wiki/Federation" title="Federation">federations</a>, meaning their regions have constitutional autonomies. Denmark, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Portugal are <a href="/wiki/Federacy" title="Federacy">federacies</a>, meaning some regions have autonomy but most do not. Spain and Italy have system of <a href="/wiki/Devolution" title="Devolution">devolution</a> where regions have autonomy, but the national government retains the right to revoke it. The United Kingdom has a mixture of federacy and devolution as only some of its regions enjoy a system of devolution while others are ruled directly from the national government.</p><p>States such as France have a number of <a href="/wiki/Special_Member_State_territories_and_the_European_Union" class="mw-redirect" title="Special Member State territories and the European Union">overseas territories</a>, retained from their <a href="/wiki/Colonial_empire" title="Colonial empire">former empires</a>. Some of these territories such as <a href="/wiki/French_Guiana" title="French Guiana">French Guiana</a> are part of the EU (see outermost regions, above) while others are related to the EU or outside it, such as the <a href="/wiki/Falkland_Islands" title="Falkland Islands">Falkland Islands</a>.</p><p>As of 2016, no member state has <a href="/wiki/Withdrawal_from_the_European_Union" title="Withdrawal from the European Union">withdrawn from the EU</a>. The United Kingdom voted to leave the EU in a non-binding referendum in 2016. <a href="/wiki/Greenland" title="Greenland">Greenland</a>, as a territory, did so when gaining home rule from a member state (Denmark). The <a href="/wiki/Lisbon_Treaty" class="mw-redirect" title="Lisbon Treaty">Lisbon Treaty</a> made the first provision of a member state to leave. The procedure for a state to leave is outlined in <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union/Title_VI:_Final_Provisions#Article_50" class="extiw" title="s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title VI: Final Provisions">TEU Article 50</a> which also makes clear that &quot;Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements&quot;. Although it calls for a negotiated withdrawal between the seceding state and the rest of the EU, if no agreement is reached two years after the seceding state announced its intention to leave, it would cease to be subject to the treaties anyway (thus ensuring a right to unilateral withdrawal).</p><p>There are a number of independence movements within member states (such as <a href="/wiki/Catalan_independentism" class="mw-redirect" title="Catalan independentism">Catalonia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Partition_of_Belgium" title="Partition of Belgium">Flanders</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Scottish_independence" title="Scottish independence">Scotland</a>). Were a territory of a member state to secede but wish to remain in the EU, some scholars claim it would need to reapply to join as if it were a new country applying from scratch. However, other studies claim <b>internal enlargement</b> is legally viable if, in case of a member state dissolution or secession, the resulting states are <i>all</i> considered <a href="/wiki/Succession_of_states" title="Succession of states">successor states</a>. There is also an <a href="/wiki/European_Citizens%27_Initiative" title="European Citizens&apos; Initiative">European Citizens&apos; Initiative</a> that aims at guaranteeing the continuity of rights and obligations of the European citizens belonging to a new state arising from the democratic secession of a European Union member state.</p><p><a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union/Title_I:_Common_Provisions#Article_7" class="extiw" title="s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title I: Common Provisions">TEU Article 7</a> provides for the suspension of certain rights of a member state. Introduced in the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Amsterdam" class="mw-redirect" title="Treaty of Amsterdam">Treaty of Amsterdam</a>, Article 7 outlines that if a member persistently breaches the EU&apos;s founding principles (liberty, democracy, human rights and so forth, outlined in <a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union/Title_I:_Common_Provisions#Article_2" class="extiw" title="s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title I: Common Provisions">TEU Article 2</a>) then the <a href="/wiki/European_Council" title="European Council">European Council</a> can vote to suspend any rights of membership, such as voting and representation as outlined above. Identifying the breach requires unanimity (excluding the state concerned), but sanctions require only a qualified majority.</p><p>The state in question would still be bound by the obligations treaties and the Council acting by majority may alter or lift such sanctions. The <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Nice" title="Treaty of Nice">Treaty of Nice</a> included a preventative mechanism whereby the Council, acting by majority, may identify a potential breach and make recommendations to the state to rectify it before action is taken against it as outlined above. However the treaties do not provide any mechanism to expel a member state outright.</p><p>There are a number of countries with strong links with the EU, similar to elements of membership. Following Norway&apos;s decision not to join the EU, it remained one of the members of the <a href="/wiki/European_Economic_Area" title="European Economic Area">European Economic Area</a> which also includes <a href="/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Liechtenstein" title="Liechtenstein">Liechtenstein</a> (all former members have joined the EU, and Switzerland rejected membership). The EEA links these countries into the EU&apos;s market, extending the <a href="/wiki/Internal_market" title="Internal market">four freedoms</a> to these states. In return, they pay a membership fee and have to adopt most areas of <a href="/wiki/Law_of_the_European_Union" class="mw-redirect" title="Law of the European Union">EU law</a> (which they do not have direct impact in shaping). The democratic repercussions of this have been described as &quot;fax democracy&quot; (waiting for new laws to be faxed in from <a href="/wiki/Brussels_and_the_European_Union" title="Brussels and the European Union">Brussels</a> rather than being involved in drafting them).</p><p>A different example is <a href="/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="Bosnia and Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, which has been under international supervision. The <a href="/wiki/High_Representative_for_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina">High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> is an international administrator who has wide ranging powers over Bosnia and Herzegovina to ensure the peace agreement is respected. The High Representative is also the EU&apos;s representative, and is in practice appointed by the EU. In this role, and since a major ambition of Bosnia and Herzegovina is to join the EU, the country has become a <i>de facto</i> protectorate of the EU. The EU appointed representative has the power to impose legislation and dismiss elected officials and civil servants, meaning the EU has greater direct control over Bosnia and Herzegovina than its own states. Indeed, the <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="Flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina">state&apos;s flag</a> was inspired by the <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_Europe" title="Flag of Europe">EU&apos;s flag</a>.</p><p>In the same manner as Bosnia and Herzegovina, <a href="/wiki/Kosovo" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> is under heavy EU influence, particularly after the <i>de facto</i> transfer from <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Interim_Administration_Mission_in_Kosovo" title="United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo">UN</a> to EU authority. In theory Kosovo is supervised by <a href="/wiki/European_Union_Rule_of_Law_Mission_in_Kosovo" title="European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo">EU missions</a>, with justice and policing personal training and helping to build up the state institutions. However the EU mission does enjoy certain executive powers over the state and has a responsibility to maintain stability and order. Like Bosnia, Kosovo has been termed an &quot;EU protectorate&quot;.</p><p>However, there is also the largely defunct term of <i>associate member</i>. It has occasionally been applied to states which have signed an <a href="/wiki/European_Union_Association_Agreement" title="European Union Association Agreement">association agreement</a> with the EU. Associate membership is not a formal classification and does not entitle the state to any of the representation of free movement rights that full membership allows. The term is almost unheard of in the modern context and was primarily used in the earlier days of the EU with countries such as Greece and Turkey. Turkey&apos;s association agreement was the 1963 <a href="/wiki/Ankara_Agreement" title="Ankara Agreement">Ankara Agreement</a>, implying that Turkey became an associate member that year. Present association agreements include the <a href="/wiki/Stabilisation_and_Association_Process" title="Stabilisation and Association Process">Stabilisation and Association Agreements</a> with the western Balkans; these states are no longer termed &quot;associate members&quot;.</p>
