In the <a href="/wiki/Hebrew_Bible" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> and the <a href="/wiki/New_Testament" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>, Satan is primarily an accuser and adversary, a decidedly malevolent entity, also called the <a href="/wiki/Devil" title="Devil">devil</a>, who possesses demonic qualities.</p><p>Although Satan is generally viewed as having negative characteristics, some groups have very different beliefs: in <a href="/wiki/Theistic_Satanism" title="Theistic Satanism">Theistic Satanism</a>, Satan is considered a deity who is either worshipped or revered.

The definite article <i>ha-</i> (English: &quot;the&quot;) is used to show that this is a title bestowed on a being, versus the name of a being. Thus, this being would be referred to as &quot;the satan&quot;.</p><p><i>Ha-Satan</i> with the <a href="/wiki/Definite_article" class="mw-redirect" title="Definite article">definite article</a> occurs 13 times in the <a href="/wiki/Masoretic_Text" title="Masoretic Text">Masoretic Text</a>, in two books of the Hebrew Bible: <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Job" title="Book of Job">Job</a> ch.1&#x2013;2 (10x) and <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Zechariah" title="Book of Zechariah">Zechariah</a> 3:1&#x2013;2 (3x).</p><p><i>Satan</i> without the definite article is used in 10 instances, of which two are translated <i>diabolos</i> in the Septuagint and &quot;Satan&quot; in the <a href="/wiki/King_James_Bible" class="mw-redirect" title="King James Bible">King James Version</a>:</p><p>The other eight instances of <i>satan</i> without the definite article are traditionally translated (in <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a>, <a href="/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> and English) as &quot;an adversary&quot;, etc., and taken to be humans or obedient angels:</p><p>At the beginning of the book, <a href="/wiki/Job_(biblical_figure)" title="Job (biblical figure)">Job</a> is a good person &quot;who revered God and turned away from evil&quot; (Job 1:1), and has therefore been rewarded by God. When the angels present themselves to God, Satan comes as well. God informs Satan about Job&apos;s blameless, morally upright character. Between Job 1:9&#x2013;10 and 2:4&#x2013;5, Satan points out that God has given Job everything that a man could want, so of course Job would be loyal to God; Satan suggests that Job&apos;s faith would collapse if all he has been given (even his health) were to be taken away from him. God therefore gives Satan permission to test Job. In the end, Job remains faithful and righteous, and there is the implication that Satan is shamed in his defeat.</p><p>Some scholars see contact with religious <a href="/wiki/Dualism" title="Dualism">dualism</a> in <a href="/wiki/Babylon" title="Babylon">Babylon</a>, and early <a href="/wiki/Zoroastrianism" title="Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrianism</a> in particular, as influencing <a href="/wiki/Second_Temple_Judaism" title="Second Temple Judaism">Second Temple Judaism</a>, and consequently early <a href="/wiki/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>.

Occasionally, the term has been used to suggest <i>evil influence</i> opposing human beings, as in the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_exegesis" class="mw-redirect" title="Jewish exegesis">Jewish exegesis</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Yetzer_hara" title="Yetzer hara">Yetzer hara</a> (&quot;evil inclination&quot; Genesis 6:5). <a href="/wiki/Micaiah" title="Micaiah">Micaiah</a>&apos;s &quot;lying spirit&quot; in 1 Kings 22:22 is sometimes related. Thus, Satan is personified as a character in three different places of the <a href="/wiki/Tenakh" class="mw-redirect" title="Tenakh">Tenakh</a>, serving as an accuser (Zechariah 3:1&#x2013;2), a seducer (1 Chronicles 21:1), or as a heavenly persecutor who is &quot;among the sons of God&quot; (Job 2:1). In any case, Satan is always subordinate to the power of God, having a role in the divine plan. Satan is rarely mentioned in <a href="/wiki/Tannaim" title="Tannaim">Tannaitic</a> literature, but is found in Babylonian <a href="/wiki/Aggadah" title="Aggadah">aggadah</a>.</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Medieval_Judaism" class="mw-redirect" title="Medieval Judaism">medieval Judaism</a>, the Rabbis rejected these Enochic literary works into the <a href="/wiki/Biblical_canon" title="Biblical canon">Biblical canon</a>, making every attempt to root them out.

The <a href="/wiki/Yetzer_hara" title="Yetzer hara">Yetzer hara</a> (&quot;evil inclination&quot; Genesis 6:5) is a more common motif for evil in rabbinical texts. Rabbinical scholarship on the <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Job" title="Book of Job">Book of Job</a> generally follows the Talmud and Maimonides as identifying the &quot;Adversary&quot; in the prologue of Job as a metaphor.</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Hasidic_Judaism" title="Hasidic Judaism">Hasidic Judaism</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Kabbalah" title="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a> presents Satan as an agent of God whose function is to tempt one into <a href="/wiki/Sin" title="Sin">sin</a>, then turn around and accuse the sinner on high. The <a href="/wiki/Hasidic_Judaism" title="Hasidic Judaism">Chasidic Jews</a> of the 18th century associated ha-Satan with <i>Baal Davar</i>.</p><p>Satan is traditionally identified as the <a href="/wiki/Serpent_(Bible)" class="mw-redirect" title="Serpent (Bible)">serpent</a> who tempted <a href="/wiki/Eve" title="Eve">Eve</a> to eat the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_fruit" title="Forbidden fruit">forbidden fruit</a>, as he was in Judaism.

According to the Qur&apos;an, Iblis (the <a href="/wiki/Arabic_language" class="mw-redirect" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> name used) disobeyed an order from <a href="/wiki/God_in_Islam" title="God in Islam">Allah</a> to bow to Adam, and as a result Iblis was forced out of heaven. However, he was given respite from further punishment until the <a href="/wiki/Islamic_eschatology" title="Islamic eschatology">day of judgment</a>.</p><p>According to the <a href="/wiki/Qur%27an" class="mw-redirect" title="Qur&apos;an">Qur&apos;an</a>, God created Satan, along with all of the other <a href="/wiki/Jinn#In_Islam" title="Jinn">jinn</a>, out of &quot;smokeless fire&quot;. The primary characteristic of the Devil, besides <a href="/wiki/Hubris" title="Hubris">hubris</a>, is that he has no power other than the power to cast evil suggestions into the hearts of men and women. The Quran says that Satan was among the angels whom God ordered to bow down to Adam after his creation, it says in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/018-qmt.php#018.050">18:50</a>:</p><p>And [mention] when We said to the angels, &quot;Prostrate to Adam,&quot; and they prostrated, except for Iblees. He was of the jinn and departed from the command of his Lord. Then will you take him and his descendants as allies other than Me while they are enemies to you? Wretched it is for the wrongdoers as an exchange.</p><p>Whether Satan was actually an angel or a Jinn whom God elevated to the angelic assembly is a matter of debate among Muslim scholars. Some scholars, such as <a href="/wiki/Ibn_Abbas" class="mw-redirect" title="Ibn Abbas">Ibn Abbas</a>, believe that Satan was actually an angel whom God created out of fire. He was the most worshipful and knowledgeable of angels. Thus, when the Quran identifies Satan as a Jinn, it means that he belonged to a class of fiery creatures called Jinn, which encompasses both heavenly Jinn (fiery angels) and earthly (ordinary) Jinn. Such a notion is evocative of the biblical <a href="/wiki/Seraphim" class="mw-redirect" title="Seraphim">seraphim</a>, a rank of angels looking like burning fire. Long before Adam was created, traditions narrate, earthly jinn roamed the earth and spread corruption upon it. God sent an army of angels under the leadership of Satan to fight them. After his victory, Satan&apos;s ego conflated; he thought he was better than any other creature, and thus God&apos;s favorite. God&apos;s creation of Man and his order to the angels to venerate him was a blow to Satan&apos;s pride. While all the angels obeyed God and bowed down to Adam, Satan disobeyed haughtily saying <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/038-qmt.php#038.076">38:76</a>:</p><p>&quot;I am better than him. You created me from fire and created him from clay.&quot;</p><p>Consequently, God expelled Satan from Heaven, with the latter promising to lure mankind into disbelief and evil as an act of revenge from their father, Adam. Also, some scholars call Satan &quot;The Peacock of Angels&quot;, referencing his foolish <a href="/wiki/Hubris" title="Hubris">hubris</a>. On the other hand, other scholars believe that there are no such things as heavenly Jinn or fiery angels, and thus Satan was not an angel. He was a Jinn whom God elevated to Heaven as a reward for his worship and righteousness. This explains why Satan managed to refuse God&apos;s order, as angels do not have free will; they obey God&apos;s orders without questioning or complaining. As for the angels, they prostrated before Adam to show their homage and obedience to God. However, Satan, adamant in his view that man is inferior, and unlike angels was given the ability to choose, made a choice of not obeying God. This caused him to be expelled by God, a fact that Satan blamed on humanity. <a href="/wiki/Hasan_of_Basra" title="Hasan of Basra">Hasan of Basra</a>, an eminent Muslim theologian who lived in the 7th century A.D, was quoted as saying:</p><p>&quot;Iblis was not an angel even for the time of an eye wink. He is the origin of Jinn as Adam is of Mankind.&quot;</p><p>It was after Satan&apos;s disobedience of God that the title of &quot;Shaitan&quot; was given to him, which can be roughly translated as &quot;Enemy&quot;, &quot;Rebel&quot;, &quot;Evil&quot;, or &quot;Devil&quot;. Shaitan then claims that, if the punishment for his act of disobedience is to be delayed until the Day of Judgment, then he will divert many of Adam&apos;s own descendants from the straight path during his period of respite. God accepts the claims of Iblis and guarantees recompense to Iblis and his followers in the form of Hellfire. In order to test mankind and jinn alike, Allah allowed Iblis to roam the earth to attempt to convert others away from his path. He was sent to earth along with <a href="/wiki/Adam_and_Eve" title="Adam and Eve">Adam and Eve</a>, after eventually luring them into eating the fruit from the <a href="/wiki/Tree_of_the_Knowledge_of_Good_and_Evil" class="mw-redirect" title="Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil">forbidden tree</a>.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Sufism" title="Sufism">Sufism</a> teaches that people should love God without expecting anything in return. Consequently, unrequited love is regarded by Sufis as that perfect type of love because the pining lover expects nothing in return. Thus, some Sufis see Satan as the paradigm of love and the perfect lover. Despite the traditional interpretation of Satan&apos;s fall from Grace as an act of excessive pride and rebellion against God, some Sufis see it as an act of self-sacrifice for God&apos;s love. Satan refused to bow down to Adam out of his uncompromising monotheism and devotion; he refused to venerate anything or anyone but God. <a href="/wiki/Al-Ghazali" title="Al-Ghazali">Al-Ghazali</a>, a well-known medieval Sufi Muslim theologian, narrates:</p><p>Encountering Eblis on the slopes of Sinai, Moses hailed him and asked, &#x201C;O Eblis, why did you not prostrate before Adam?&#x201D; Eblis replied, &#x201C;Heaven forbid that anyone worship anything but the One. [&#x2026;] This command was a test.&#x201D;</p><p>Satan believed that God ordered him to bow down to Adam to test his love for him. Satan should maintain his love for God at any cost. So, even if the cost of Satan&apos;s refusal to prostrate before Adam is falling from Grace, he should proceed with it out of his unconditional love for God. <a href="/wiki/Abdul_Karim_Jili" class="mw-redirect" title="Abdul Karim Jili">Abdul Karim Jili</a>, a Muslim Sufi saint, believes that after the Day of Judgement, Hell will cease to exist, and Satan will be back to the service of God as one of his cherished angels.</p><p>An alternative name for the main deity in the tentatively <a href="/wiki/Indo-European" class="mw-redirect" title="Indo-European">Indo-European</a> pantheon of the <a href="/wiki/Yazidis" title="Yazidis">Yazidis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Melek_Taus" title="Melek Taus">Melek Taus</a>, is Shaitan.

In this religion, &quot;Satan&quot; is not viewed or depicted as a hubristic, irrational, and fraudulent creature, but is rather seen as being <a href="/wiki/Prometheus" title="Prometheus">Prometheus</a>-like in terms of attributes, symbolizing liberty and the like.To adherents, he also serves as a conceptual framework and an external metaphorical projection of [the Satanists] highest personal potential. In his essay <i>&quot;Satanism: The Feared Religion&quot;</i>, the current High Priest of the Church of Satan, <a href="/wiki/Peter_H._Gilmore" title="Peter H. Gilmore">Peter H. Gilmore</a>, further expounds that &quot;...Satan is a symbol of Man living as his prideful, carnal nature dictates. The reality behind Satan is simply the dark evolutionary force of entropy that permeates all of nature and provides the drive for survival and propagation inherent in all living things. Satan is not a conscious entity to be worshiped, rather a reservoir of power inside each human to be tapped at will&quot;.</p><p>LaVeyan Satanists embrace the original etymological meaning of the word &quot;Satan&quot; (<a href="/wiki/Hebrew" class="mw-redirect" title="Hebrew">Hebrew</a>: &#x5E9;&#x5B8;&#x5BC;&#x5C2;&#x5D8;&#x5B8;&#x5DF; <i>satan</i>, meaning &quot;adversary&quot;). According to Peter H. Gilmore, &quot;The Church of Satan has chosen Satan as its primary symbol because in Hebrew it means adversary, opposer, one to accuse or question. We see ourselves as being these Satans; the adversaries, opposers and accusers of all spiritual belief systems that would try to hamper enjoyment of our life as a human being&quot;</p>
