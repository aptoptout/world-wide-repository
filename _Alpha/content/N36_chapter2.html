<p>The abstract noun <i><a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anthropology" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:anthropology">anthropology</a></i> is first attested in reference to <a href="/wiki/History" title="History">history</a>. Its present use first appeared in <a href="/wiki/German_Renaissance" title="German Renaissance">Renaissance</a> <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire" title="Holy Roman Empire">Germany</a> in the works of <a href="/wiki/Magnus_Hundt" title="Magnus Hundt">Magnus Hundt</a> and <a href="/wiki/Otto_Casmann" title="Otto Casmann">Otto Casmann</a>. Their <a href="/wiki/New_Latin" title="New Latin">New Latin</a> <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">anthropologia</span></i> derived from the <a href="/wiki/Combining_form" class="mw-redirect" title="Combining form">combining forms</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greek" title="Ancient Greek">Greek</a> words <i>&#xE1;nthr&#x14D;pos</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%84%CE%BD%CE%B8%CF%81%CF%89%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%82" class="extiw" title="wikt:&#x1F04;&#x3BD;&#x3B8;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;">&#x1F04;&#x3BD;&#x3B8;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</a></span>, &quot;<a href="/wiki/Human" title="Human">human</a>&quot;) and <i>l&#xF3;gos</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BB%CF%8C%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82" class="extiw" title="wikt:&#x3BB;&#x3CC;&#x3B3;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;">&#x3BB;&#x3CC;&#x3B3;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</a></span>, &quot;<a href="/wiki/Science" title="Science">study</a>&quot;). (Its adjectival form appeared in the works of <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>.) It began to be used in English, possibly via <a href="/wiki/French_language" title="French language">French</a> <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">anthropologie</span></i>, by the early 18th century.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Through_the_19th_century">Through the 19th century</span></h3>
<p>In 1647, the Bartholins, founders of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Copenhagen" title="University of Copenhagen">University of Copenhagen</a>, defined <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l&apos;anthropologie</span></i> as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anthropology, that is to say the science that treats of man, is divided ordinarily and with reason into Anatomy, which considers the body and the parts, and Psychology, which speaks of the soul.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently, such as the use by <a href="/wiki/%C3%89tienne_Serres" title="&#xC9;tienne Serres">&#xC9;tienne Serres</a> in 1838 to describe the natural history, or paleontology, of man, based on comparative anatomy, and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 1850 at the <a href="/wiki/National_Museum_of_Natural_History_(France)" title="National Museum of Natural History (France)">National Museum of Natural History (France)</a> by <a href="/wiki/Jean_Louis_Armand_de_Quatrefages_de_Br%C3%A9au" title="Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Br&#xE9;au">Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Br&#xE9;au</a>. Various short-lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed. The <a href="/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_Ethnologique_de_Paris" title="Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; Ethnologique de Paris">Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; Ethnologique de Paris</a>, the first to use <a href="/wiki/Ethnology" title="Ethnology">Ethnology</a>, was formed in 1839. Its members were primarily anti-slavery activists. When slavery was abolished in France in 1848 the Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; was abandoned.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Ethnological Society of New York, currently the <a href="/wiki/American_Ethnological_Society" title="American Ethnological Society">American Ethnological Society</a>, was founded on its model in 1842, as well as the <a href="/wiki/Ethnological_Society_of_London" title="Ethnological Society of London">Ethnological Society of London</a> in 1843, a break-away group of the <a href="/wiki/Aborigines%27_Protection_Society" title="Aborigines&apos; Protection Society">Aborigines&apos; Protection Society</a>. These anthropologists of the times were liberal, anti-slavery, and pro-<a href="/wiki/Human_rights" title="Human rights">human-rights activists.</a> They maintained international connections.</p>
<p>Anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier 19th century. Theorists in such diverse fields as <a href="/wiki/Comparative_anatomy" title="Comparative anatomy">anatomy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Comparative_method_(linguistics)" title="Comparative method (linguistics)">linguistics</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ethnology" title="Ethnology">Ethnology</a>, making feature-by-feature comparisons of their subject matters, were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals, languages, and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then. For them, the publication of <a href="/wiki/Charles_Darwin" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species" title="On the Origin of Species">On the Origin of Species</a></i> was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect. Darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in <a href="/wiki/Agronomy" title="Agronomy">agronomy</a> and in the wild.</p>
<p>Darwin and Wallace unveiled evolution in the late 1850s. There was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences. <a href="/wiki/Paul_Broca" title="Paul Broca">Paul Broca</a> in Paris was in the process of breaking away from the <a href="/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_de_biologie" title="Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; de biologie">Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; de biologie</a> to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies, the <a href="/wiki/Society_of_Anthropology_of_Paris" title="Society of Anthropology of Paris">Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; d&apos;Anthropologie de Paris</a>, meeting for the first time in Paris in 1859. When he read Darwin he became an immediate convert to <i>Transformisme</i>, as the French called <a href="/wiki/Evolutionism" title="Evolutionism">evolutionism</a>. His definition now became &quot;the study of the human group, considered as a whole, in its details, and in relation to the rest of nature&quot;.</p>
<p>Broca, being what today would be called a <a href="/wiki/Neurosurgery" title="Neurosurgery">neurosurgeon</a>, had taken an interest in the pathology of speech. He wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals, which appeared to reside in speech. He discovered the speech center of the human brain, today called <a href="/wiki/Broca%27s_area" title="Broca&apos;s area">Broca&apos;s area</a> after him. His interest was mainly in <a href="/wiki/Biological_anthropology" title="Biological anthropology">Biological anthropology</a>, but a German philosopher specializing in psychology, <a href="/wiki/Theodor_Waitz" title="Theodor Waitz">Theodor Waitz</a>, took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six-volume work, entitled <i>Die Anthropologie der Naturv&#xF6;lker</i>, 1859&#x2013;1864. The title was soon translated as &quot;The Anthropology of Primitive Peoples&quot;. The last two volumes were published posthumously.</p>
<p>Waitz defined anthropology as &quot;the science of the nature of man&quot;. By nature he meant matter animated by &quot;the Divine breath&quot;; i.e., he was an <a href="/wiki/Animism" title="Animism">animist</a>. Following Broca&apos;s lead, Waitz points out that anthropology is a new field, which would gather material from other fields, but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy, physiology, and psychology to differentiate man from &quot;the animals nearest to him&quot;. He stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical, gathered by experimentation. The history of civilization as well as ethnology are to be brought into the comparison. It is to be presumed fundamentally that the species, man, is a unity, and that &quot;the same laws of thought are applicable to all men&quot;.</p>
<p>Waitz was influential among the British ethnologists. In 1863 the explorer <a href="/wiki/Richard_Francis_Burton" title="Richard Francis Burton">Richard Francis Burton</a> and the speech therapist <a href="/wiki/James_Hunt_(speech_therapist)" title="James Hunt (speech therapist)">James Hunt</a> broke away from the <a href="/wiki/Ethnological_Society_of_London" title="Ethnological Society of London">Ethnological Society of London</a> to form the <a href="/wiki/Anthropological_Society_of_London" title="Anthropological Society of London">Anthropological Society of London</a>, which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology. It was the 2nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence. Representatives from the French <i>Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9;</i> were present, though not Broca. In his keynote address, printed in the first volume of its new publication, <i>The Anthropological Review</i>, Hunt stressed the work of Waitz, adopting his definitions as a standard. Among the first associates were the young <a href="/wiki/Edward_Burnett_Tylor" title="Edward Burnett Tylor">Edward Burnett Tylor</a>, inventor of <a href="/wiki/Cultural_anthropology" title="Cultural anthropology">cultural anthropology</a>, and his brother <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Tylor" title="Alfred Tylor">Alfred Tylor</a>, a geologist. Previously Edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist; subsequently, an anthropologist.</p>
<p>Similar organizations in other countries followed: The <a href="/wiki/American_Anthropological_Association" title="American Anthropological Association">American Anthropological Association</a> in 1902, the Anthropological Society of Madrid (1865), the Anthropological Society of Vienna (1870), the Italian Society of Anthropology and Ethnology (1871), and many others subsequently. The majority of these were evolutionist. One notable exception was the <a href="//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berliner_Gesellschaft_f%C3%BCr_Anthropologie,_Ethnologie_und_Urgeschichte" class="extiw" title="de:Berliner Gesellschaft f&#xFC;r Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte">Berlin Society of Anthropology</a> (1869) founded by <a href="/wiki/Rudolph_Virchow" class="mw-redirect" title="Rudolph Virchow">Rudolph Virchow</a>, known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists. Not religious himself, he insisted that Darwin&apos;s conclusions lacked empirical foundation.</p>
<p>During the last three decades of the 19th century a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred, most independent, most publishing their own journals, and all international in membership and association. The major theorists belonged to these organizations. They supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning. By 1898 the American Association for the Advancement of Science was able to report that 48 educational institutions in 13 countries had some curriculum in anthropology. None of the 75 faculty members were under a department named anthropology.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="20th_and_21st_centuries">20th and 21st centuries</span></h3>
<p>This meagre statistic expanded in the 20th century to comprise anthropology departments in the majority of the world&apos;s higher educational institutions, many thousands in number. Anthropology has diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more. Practical anthropology, the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems, has arrived; for example, the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene. Organization has reached global level. For example, the World Council of Anthropological Associations (WCAA), &quot;a network of national, regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology&quot;, currently contains members from about three dozen nations.</p>
<p>Since the work of <a href="/wiki/Franz_Boas" title="Franz Boas">Franz Boas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bronis%C5%82aw_Malinowski" title="Bronis&#x142;aw Malinowski">Bronis&#x142;aw Malinowski</a> in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, <i>social</i> anthropology in Great Britain and <a href="/wiki/Cultural_anthropology" title="Cultural anthropology"><i>cultural</i> anthropology</a> in the US have been distinguished from other social sciences by its emphasis on <a href="/wiki/Cross-cultural_studies" title="Cross-cultural studies">cross-cultural comparisons</a>, long-term in-depth examination of context, and the importance it places on <a href="/wiki/Participant_observation" title="Participant observation">participant-observation</a> or experiential immersion in the area of research. Cultural anthropology in particular has emphasized <a href="/wiki/Cultural_relativism" title="Cultural relativism">cultural relativism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Holism" title="Holism">holism</a>, and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques. This has been particularly prominent in the United States, from Boas&apos; arguments against 19th-century racial <a href="/wiki/Ideology" title="Ideology">ideology</a>, through <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Mead" title="Margaret Mead">Margaret Mead</a>&apos;s advocacy for <a href="/wiki/Gender_equality" title="Gender equality">gender equality</a> and sexual liberation, to current criticisms of <a href="/wiki/Post-colonialism" class="mw-redirect" title="Post-colonialism">post-colonial</a> oppression and promotion of <a href="/wiki/Multiculturalism" title="Multiculturalism">multiculturalism</a>. <a href="/wiki/Ethnography" title="Ethnography">Ethnography</a> is one of its primary <a href="/wiki/Research_design" title="Research design">research designs</a> as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork.</p>
<p>In Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries, the British tradition of <a href="/wiki/Social_anthropology" title="Social anthropology">social anthropology</a> tends to dominate. In the United States, anthropology has traditionally been divided into the <a href="/wiki/Four_field_approach" title="Four field approach">four field approach</a> developed by <a href="/wiki/Franz_Boas" title="Franz Boas">Franz Boas</a> in the early 20th century: <a href="/wiki/Biological_anthropology" title="Biological anthropology"><i>biological</i> or <i>physical</i> anthropology</a>; <a href="/wiki/Social_anthropology" title="Social anthropology"><i>social</i></a>, <a href="/wiki/Cultural_anthropology" title="Cultural anthropology"><i>cultural</i></a>, or <a href="/wiki/Sociocultural_anthropology" title="Sociocultural anthropology"><i>sociocultural</i> anthropology</a>; and <a href="/wiki/Archaeology" title="Archaeology">archaeology</a>; plus <a href="/wiki/Linguistic_anthropology" title="Linguistic anthropology">anthropological linguistics</a>. These fields frequently overlap, but tend to use different methodologies and techniques.</p>
<p>European countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more <a href="/wiki/Ethnology" title="Ethnology">ethnology</a> (a term coined and defined by <a href="/wiki/Adam_Franti%C5%A1ek_Koll%C3%A1r" title="Adam Franti&#x161;ek Koll&#xE1;r">Adam F. Koll&#xE1;r</a> in 1783). In non-colonial European countries, <a href="/wiki/Social_anthropology" title="Social anthropology">social anthropology</a> is now defined as the study of social organization in non-state societies. It is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the European tradition.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Fields">Fields</span></h2>

<p>Anthropology is a global discipline where humanities, social, and natural sciences are forced to confront one another. Anthropology builds upon knowledge from <a href="/wiki/Natural_sciences" class="mw-redirect" title="Natural sciences">natural sciences</a>, including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of <i><a href="/wiki/Human" title="Human">Homo sapiens</a></i>, human physical traits, <a href="/wiki/Human_behavior" title="Human behavior">human behavior</a>, the variations among different groups of humans, how the evolutionary past of <i>Homo sapiens</i> has influenced its social organization and culture, and from <a href="/wiki/Social_sciences" class="mw-redirect" title="Social sciences">social sciences</a>, including the organization of human social and cultural relations, institutions, social conflicts, etc. Early anthropology originated in Classical Greece and Persia and studied and tried to understand observable cultural diversity. As such, anthropology has been central in the development of several new (late 20th century) interdisciplinary fields such as <a href="/wiki/Cognitive_science" title="Cognitive science">cognitive science</a>, <a href="/wiki/Global_studies" title="Global studies">global studies</a>, and various <a href="/wiki/Ethnic_studies" title="Ethnic studies">ethnic studies</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Clifford_Geertz" title="Clifford Geertz">Clifford Geertz</a>,</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>&quot;anthropology is perhaps the last of the great nineteenth-century conglomerate disciplines still for the most part organizationally intact. Long after natural history, moral philosophy, philology, and political economy have dissolved into their specialized successors, it has remained a diffuse assemblage of ethnology, human biology, comparative linguistics, and prehistory, held together mainly by the vested interests, sunk costs, and administrative habits of academia, and by a romantic image of comprehensive scholarship.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/wiki/Sociocultural_anthropology" title="Sociocultural anthropology">Sociocultural anthropology</a> has been heavily influenced by <a href="/wiki/Structuralism" title="Structuralism">structuralist</a> and postmodern theories, as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies. During the 1970s and 1990s, there was an <a href="/wiki/Epistemological" class="mw-redirect" title="Epistemological">epistemological</a> shift away from the <a href="/wiki/Positivist" class="mw-redirect" title="Positivist">positivist</a> traditions that had largely informed the discipline. During this shift, enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology. In contrast, archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist. Due to this difference in epistemology, the four sub-fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sociocultural">Sociocultural</span></h3>

<p>Sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of <a href="/wiki/Cultural_anthropology" title="Cultural anthropology">cultural anthropology</a> and <a href="/wiki/Social_anthropology" title="Social anthropology">social anthropology</a>. Cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people <i>make sense</i> of the world around them, while social anthropology is the study of the <i>relationships</i> among persons and groups. Cultural anthropology is more related to <a href="/wiki/Philosophy" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>, literature and <a href="/wiki/The_arts" title="The arts">the arts</a> (how one&apos;s culture affects experience for self and group, contributing to more complete understanding of the people&apos;s knowledge, customs, and institutions), while social anthropology is more related to <a href="/wiki/Sociology" title="Sociology">sociology</a> and history. in that it helps develop understanding of social structures, typically of others and other populations (such as minorities, subgroups, dissidents, etc.). There is no hard-and-fast distinction between them, and these categories overlap to a considerable degree.</p>
<p>Inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by <a href="/wiki/Cultural_relativism" title="Cultural relativism">cultural relativism</a>, the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values. Accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross-cultural comparison. This project is often accommodated in the field of <a href="/wiki/Ethnography" title="Ethnography">ethnography</a>. Ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research, i.e. an ethnographic monograph. As methodology, ethnography is based upon long-term fieldwork within a community or other research site. <a href="/wiki/Participant_observation" title="Participant observation">Participant observation</a> is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology. <a href="/wiki/Ethnology" title="Ethnology">Ethnology</a> involves the systematic comparison of different cultures. The process of participant-observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an <a href="/wiki/Emic" class="mw-redirect" title="Emic">emic</a> (conceptual, vs. <a href="/wiki/Etic" class="mw-redirect" title="Etic">etic</a>, or technical) point of view.</p>
<p>The study of <a href="/wiki/Kinship" title="Kinship">kinship</a> and <a href="/wiki/Social_organization" title="Social organization">social organization</a> is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology, as kinship is a <a href="/wiki/Human_universal" class="mw-redirect" title="Human universal">human universal</a>. Sociocultural anthropology also covers <a href="/wiki/Economic_anthropology" title="Economic anthropology">economic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Political_anthropology" title="Political anthropology">political organization</a>, law and conflict resolution, patterns of consumption and exchange, material culture, technology, infrastructure, gender relations, ethnicity, childrearing and socialization, religion, myth, symbols, values, etiquette, worldview, sports, music, nutrition, recreation, games, food, festivals, and language (which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology).</p>
<p>Comparison across cultures is a key element of method in sociocultural anthropology, including the industrialized (and de-industrialized) West. Cultures in the <a href="/wiki/Standard_Cross-Cultural_Sample" class="mw-redirect" title="Standard Cross-Cultural Sample">Standard Cross-Cultural Sample</a> (SCCS) of world societies are:</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Art">Art</span></h4>

<p>One of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of &apos;art&apos; as a cultural phenomenon. Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of &apos;painting&apos;, &apos;sculpture&apos;, or &apos;literature&apos;, conceived as independent artistic activities, do not exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western contexts. To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being &apos;artistic&apos;, have certain evident &apos;aesthetic&apos; qualities. Boas&apos; <i>Primitive Art</i>, Claude L&#xE9;vi-Strauss&apos; <i>The Way of the Masks</i> (1982) or Geertz&apos;s &apos;Art as Cultural System&apos; (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of &apos;art&apos; into an anthropology of culturally specific &apos;aesthetics&apos;.</p>

<p>Media anthropology (also known as anthropology of media or mass media) emphasizes <a href="/wiki/Ethnography" title="Ethnography">ethnographic studies</a> as a means of understanding producers, audiences, and other cultural and social aspects of mass media. The types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production (e.g., ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers, journalists in the field, film production) to contexts of media reception, following audiences in their everyday responses to media. Other types include <a href="/wiki/Cyber_anthropology" class="mw-redirect" title="Cyber anthropology">cyber anthropology</a>, a relatively new area of <a href="/wiki/Internet_research" title="Internet research">internet research</a>, as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media, such as development work, <a href="/wiki/Social_movement" title="Social movement">social movements</a>, or health education.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Economic">Economic</span></h4>

<p>Economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic, geographic and cultural scope. It has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics, of which it is highly critical. Its origins as a sub-field of anthropology begin with the Polish-British founder of Anthropology, <a href="/wiki/Bronislaw_Malinowski" class="mw-redirect" title="Bronislaw Malinowski">Bronislaw Malinowski</a>, and his French compatriot, <a href="/wiki/Marcel_Mauss" title="Marcel Mauss">Marcel Mauss</a>, on the nature of gift-giving exchange (or <a href="/wiki/Reciprocity_(cultural_anthropology)" title="Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)">reciprocity</a>) as an alternative to market exchange. Economic Anthropology remains, for the most part, focused upon exchange. The school of thought derived from Marx and known as Political Economy focuses on production, in contrast. Economic Anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists, and have now turned to examine corporations, banks, and the <a href="/wiki/Global_financial_system" title="Global financial system">global financial system</a> from an anthropological perspective.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Political_economy">Political economy</span></h4>

<p>Political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of <a href="/wiki/Historical_Materialism" class="mw-redirect" title="Historical Materialism">Historical Materialism</a> to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies. Political Economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture. Three main areas of interest rapidly developed. The first of these areas was concerned with the &quot;pre-capitalist&quot; societies that were subject to evolutionary &quot;tribal&quot; stereotypes. Sahlins work on Hunter-gatherers as the &apos;original affluent society&apos; did much to dissipate that image. The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world&apos;s population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam. The third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist world-system. More recently, these Political Economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial (and post-industrial) capitalism around the world.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Applied">Applied</span></h4>

<p>Applied Anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems. It is a, &quot;complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy&quot;. More simply, applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community. It is closely related to <a href="/wiki/Development_anthropology" title="Development anthropology">Development anthropology</a> (distinct from the more critical <a href="/wiki/Anthropology_of_development" title="Anthropology of development">Anthropology of development</a>).</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Development">Development</span></h4>

<p>Anthropology of development tends to view development from a <i>critical</i> perspective. The kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach simply involve pondering why, if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty, is poverty increasing? Why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes? Why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer? Why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis? In short why does so much planned development fail?</p>

<p><i>Kinship</i> can refer both to <i>the study of</i> the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures, or it can refer to <i>the patterns of social relationships</i> themselves. Over its history, anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms, such as &quot;<a href="/wiki/Kinship" title="Kinship">descent</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="/wiki/Descent_group" class="mw-redirect" title="Descent group">descent groups</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="/wiki/Lineage_(anthropology)" title="Lineage (anthropology)">lineages</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="/wiki/Affinity_(law)" title="Affinity (law)">affines</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="/wiki/Cognatic_kinship" title="Cognatic kinship">cognates</a>&quot;, and even &quot;<a href="/wiki/Fictive_kinship" title="Fictive kinship">fictive kinship</a>&quot;.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Feminist">Feminist</span></h4>

<p>Feminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology (<a href="/wiki/Archaeology" title="Archaeology">archeological</a>, <a href="/wiki/Biological_anthropology" title="Biological anthropology">biological</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cultural_anthropology" title="Cultural anthropology">cultural</a>, <a href="/wiki/Linguistic_anthropology" title="Linguistic anthropology">linguistic</a>) that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings, anthropological hiring practices, and the scholarly production of knowledge. Anthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions, whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white European and American feminists. Historically, such &apos;peripheral&apos; perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the <a href="/wiki/Western_world" title="Western world">western world</a>.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Medical">Medical</span></h4>

<p>Medical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies &quot;human health and disease, health care systems, and biocultural adaptation&quot;. Currently, research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole. It focuses on the following six basic fields:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering (Farmer, 1999, 2003; Beneduce, 2010) as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness. On the other hand, there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production, such as <i>cultural psychiatry</i> and <i>transcultural psychiatry</i> or <i>ethnopsychiatry</i>.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Nutritional">Nutritional</span></h4>

<p>Nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between <a href="/wiki/Economic_systems" class="mw-redirect" title="Economic systems">economic systems</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nutrition" title="Nutrition">nutritional status</a> and <a href="/wiki/Food_security" title="Food security">food security</a>, and how changes in the former affect the latter. If economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food, food security, and dietary health, then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization. Nutritional status affects overall health status, work performance potential, and the overall potential for economic development (either in terms of human development or traditional western models) for any given group of people.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Psychological">Psychological</span></h4>

<p>Psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of <a href="/wiki/Cultural_anthropology" title="Cultural anthropology">cultural</a> and <a href="/wiki/Psychology" title="Psychology">mental processes</a>. This subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans&apos; development and <a href="/wiki/Enculturation" title="Enculturation">enculturation</a> within a particular cultural group&#x2014;with its own history, language, practices, and conceptual categories&#x2014;shape processes of human <a href="/wiki/Cognition" title="Cognition">cognition</a>, <a href="/wiki/Emotion" title="Emotion">emotion</a>, <a href="/wiki/Perception" title="Perception">perception</a>, <a href="/wiki/Motivation" title="Motivation">motivation</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Mental_health" title="Mental health">mental health</a>. It also examines how the understanding of cognition, emotion, motivation, and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Cognitive">Cognitive</span></h4>

<p>Cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge, cultural <a href="/wiki/Innovation" title="Innovation">innovation</a>, and transmission over time and space using the methods and <a href="/wiki/Theories" class="mw-redirect" title="Theories">theories</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Cognitive_sciences" class="mw-redirect" title="Cognitive sciences">cognitive sciences</a> (especially <a href="/wiki/Experimental_psychology" title="Experimental psychology">experimental psychology</a> and <a href="/wiki/Evolutionary_biology" title="Evolutionary biology">evolutionary biology</a>) often through close collaboration with historians, ethnographers, archaeologists, linguists, musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and <a href="/wiki/Interpretation_(logic)" title="Interpretation (logic)">interpretation</a> of cultural forms. Cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Transpersonal">Transpersonal</span></h4>

<p>Transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between <a href="/wiki/Altered_states_of_consciousness" class="mw-redirect" title="Altered states of consciousness">altered states of consciousness</a> and culture. As with <a href="/wiki/Transpersonal_psychology" title="Transpersonal psychology">transpersonal psychology</a>, the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness (ASC) and <a href="/wiki/Transpersonal_experience" class="mw-redirect" title="Transpersonal experience">transpersonal experience</a>. However, the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues&#x2014;for instance, the roles of <a href="/wiki/Mythology" title="Mythology">myth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ritual" title="Ritual">ritual</a>, <a href="/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)" title="Diet (nutrition)">diet</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Literature" title="Literature">texts</a> in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Political_and_legal">Political and legal</span></h3>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Political">Political</span></h4>

<p>Political anthropology concerns the structure of <a href="/wiki/Form_of_government" class="mw-redirect" title="Form of government">political systems</a>, looked at from the basis of the structure of societies. Political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies, a new development started from the 1960s, and is still unfolding: anthropologists started increasingly to study more &quot;complex&quot; social settings in which the presence of states, bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena. The turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels. First of all, anthropologists continued to study <a href="/wiki/Political_organization" title="Political organization">political organization</a> and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere (as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization). Second of all, anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and of course on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions). An anthropology of the state developed, and it is a most thriving field today. Geertz&apos; comparative work on &quot;Negara&quot;, the Balinese state is an early, famous example.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Legal">Legal</span></h4>

<p>Legal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in &quot;the cross-cultural study of social ordering&quot;. Earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation. More recent applications include issues such as <a href="/wiki/Human_rights" title="Human rights">human rights</a>, <a href="/wiki/Legal_pluralism" title="Legal pluralism">legal pluralism</a>, and political uprisings.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Public">Public</span></h4>

<p>Public Anthropology was created by Robert Borofsky, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University, to &quot;demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline - illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad, public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change&quot; (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.publicanthropology.org">Borofsky 2004</a>).</p>

<p>Cyborg anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the <a href="/wiki/American_Anthropological_Association" title="American Anthropological Association">American Anthropological Association</a>&apos;s annual meeting in 1993. The sub-group was very closely related to <a href="/wiki/Science_and_technology_studies" class="mw-redirect" title="Science and technology studies">STS</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Society_for_the_Social_Studies_of_Science" class="mw-redirect" title="Society for the Social Studies of Science">Society for the Social Studies of Science</a>. <a href="/wiki/Donna_Haraway" title="Donna Haraway">Donna Haraway</a>&apos;s 1985 <i><a href="/wiki/Cyborg_Manifesto" class="mw-redirect" title="Cyborg Manifesto">Cyborg Manifesto</a></i> could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term. Cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built, specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Digital">Digital</span></h4>

<p>Digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital-era technology, and extends to various areas where anthropology and <a href="/wiki/Technology" title="Technology">technology</a> intersect. It is sometimes grouped with <a href="/wiki/Cultural_anthropology" title="Cultural anthropology">sociocultural anthropology</a>, and sometimes considered part of <a href="/wiki/Material_culture" title="Material culture">material culture</a>.

<p>Ecological anthropology is defined as the &quot;study of <a href="/wiki/Cultural_adaptation" class="mw-redirect" title="Cultural adaptation">cultural adaptations</a> to environments&quot;. The sub-field is also defined as, &quot;the study of relationships between a population of humans and their <a href="/wiki/Biophysical_environment" class="mw-redirect" title="Biophysical environment">biophysical environment</a>&quot;. The focus of its research concerns &quot;how cultural <a href="/wiki/Beliefs" class="mw-redirect" title="Beliefs">beliefs</a> and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments, and how people used elements of their culture to maintain their <a href="/wiki/Ecosystems" class="mw-redirect" title="Ecosystems">ecosystems</a>.&quot;</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Environmental">Environmental</span></h4>

<p>Environmental anthropology is a sub-specialty within the field of anthropology that takes an active role in examining the relationships between humans and their environment across space and time. The contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology, and arguably at least the backdrop, if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today, is <a href="/wiki/Political_ecology" title="Political ecology">political ecology</a>. Many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture, politics and power, globalization, localized issues, and more. The focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for/against or creation of policy, and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land. Often, the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly (organizing, participation) or indirectly (articles, documentaries, books, ethnographies). Such is the case with environmental justice advocate Melissa Checker and her relationship with the people of Hyde Park.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Religion">Religion</span></h3>


<p>The anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions, and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures. Modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between <a href="/wiki/Magical_thinking" title="Magical thinking">magical thinking</a> and religion, and that every religion is a cultural product, created by the human <a href="/wiki/Community" title="Community">community</a> that worships it.</p>

There are two principle approaches in urban anthropology: by examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities. These two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other. By defining different types of cities, one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities. By directly looking at the different social issues, one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city.</p>

This is the notion that cultures should not be judged by another&apos;s values or viewpoints, but be examined dispassionately on their own terms. There should be no notions, in good anthropology, of one culture being better or worse than another culture.</p>
<p>Ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting <a href="/wiki/Genocide" title="Genocide">genocide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Infanticide" title="Infanticide">infanticide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Racism" title="Racism">racism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mutilation" title="Mutilation">mutilation</a> (including <a href="/wiki/Circumcision" title="Circumcision">circumcision</a> and <a href="/wiki/Subincision" class="mw-redirect" title="Subincision">subincision</a>), and <a href="/wiki/Torture" title="Torture">torture</a>. Topics like racism, slavery, and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies to genes to <a href="/wiki/Acculturation" title="Acculturation">acculturation</a> have been proposed, not to mention theories of <a href="/wiki/Colonialism" title="Colonialism">colonialism</a> and many others as root causes of <a href="/wiki/Man%27s_inhumanity_to_man" title="Man&apos;s inhumanity to man">Man&apos;s inhumanity to man</a>. To illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach, one can take just one of these topics, such as &quot;racism&quot; and find thousands of anthropological references, stretching across all the major and minor sub-fields.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ethical_stance_to_military_involvement">Ethical stance to military involvement</span></h3>
<p>Anthropologists&apos; involvement with the U.S. government, in particular, has caused bitter controversy within the discipline. Franz Boas publicly objected to US participation in World War I, and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several American archaeologists in espionage in Mexico under their cover as scientists.</p>
<p>But by the 1940s, many of Boas&apos; anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the &quot;Axis&quot; (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan). Many served in the armed forces, while others worked in intelligence (for example, <a href="/wiki/Office_of_Strategic_Services" title="Office of Strategic Services">Office of Strategic Services</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Office_of_War_Information" class="mw-redirect" title="Office of War Information">Office of War Information</a>). At the same time, <a href="/wiki/David_H._Price" class="mw-redirect" title="David H. Price">David H. Price</a>&apos;s work on American anthropology during the Cold War provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies.</p>
<p>Attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the CIA and government intelligence activities during the Vietnam War years have turned up surprisingly little (although anthropologist <a href="/w/index.php?title=Hugo_Nutini&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Hugo Nutini (page does not exist)">Hugo Nutini</a> was active in the stillborn <a href="/wiki/Project_Camelot" title="Project Camelot">Project Camelot</a>). Many anthropologists (students and teachers) were active in the antiwar movement. Numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the <a href="/wiki/American_Anthropological_Association" title="American Anthropological Association">American Anthropological Association</a> (AAA).</p>
<p>Professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the <a href="/wiki/State_(polity)" title="State (polity)">state</a>. Their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings. The <a href="/wiki/Association_of_Social_Anthropologists_of_the_UK_and_Commonwealth" class="mw-redirect" title="Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth">Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth</a> (ASA) has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous. The AAA&apos;s current &apos;Statement of Professional Responsibility&apos; clearly states that &quot;in relation with their own government and with host governments&#xA0;... no secret research, no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given.&quot;</p>
<p>Anthropologists, along with other social scientists, are working with the US military as part of the US Army&apos;s strategy in Afghanistan. The <i><a href="/wiki/Christian_Science_Monitor" class="mw-redirect" title="Christian Science Monitor">Christian Science Monitor</a></i> reports that &quot;Counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs&quot; <a href="/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%93present)" class="mw-redirect" title="War in Afghanistan (2001&#x2013;present)">in Afghanistan</a>, under the <i><a href="/wiki/Human_Terrain_System" title="Human Terrain System">Human Terrain System</a></i> (HTS) program; in addition, HTS teams are working with the <a href="/wiki/US_military_in_Iraq" class="mw-redirect" title="US military in Iraq">US military in Iraq</a>. In 2009, the American Anthropological Association&apos;s Commission on the Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Communities released its final report concluding, in part, that, &quot;When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions, not subject to external review, where data collection occurs in the context of war, integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency, and in a potentially coercive environment &#x2013; all characteristic factors of the HTS concept and its application &#x2013; it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology. In summary, while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible, CEAUSSIC suggests that the AAA emphasize the incompatibility of HTS with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing HTS to define the meaning of &quot;anthropology&quot; within DoD.&quot;</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Post.E2.80.93World_War_II_developments">Post&#x2013;World War II developments</span></h2>
<p>Before WWII British &apos;social anthropology&apos; and American &apos;cultural anthropology&apos; were still distinct traditions. After the war, enough British and American anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as &apos;sociocultural&apos; anthropology.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Basic_trends">Basic trends</span></h3>
<p>There are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work. One of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more <a href="/wiki/Holism" title="Holism">holistic</a> account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical. The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place, problem or phenomenon in detail, using a variety of methods, over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia.</p>
<p>In the 1990s and 2000s (decade), calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.</p>
<p>Biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation and in the possibility of human universals (behaviors, ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures). They use many different methods of study, but modern population <a href="/wiki/Genetics" title="Genetics">genetics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Participant_observation" title="Participant observation">participant observation</a> and other techniques often take anthropologists &quot;into the field,&quot; which means traveling to a community in its own setting, to do something called &quot;fieldwork.&quot; On the biological or physical side, human measurements, genetic samples, nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs.</p>
<p>Along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis, anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions. Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material, such as the <a href="/wiki/Paleolithic" title="Paleolithic">Paleolithic</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Neolithic" title="Neolithic">Neolithic</a>, of particular use in archaeology. Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types, such as <a href="/wiki/Olduwan" class="mw-redirect" title="Olduwan">Olduwan</a> or <a href="/wiki/Mousterian" title="Mousterian">Mousterian</a> or <a href="/wiki/Levallois_technique" title="Levallois technique">Levalloisian</a> help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past. Anthropologists and geographers share approaches to <a href="/wiki/Culture_regions" class="mw-redirect" title="Culture regions">Culture regions</a> as well, since mapping cultures is central to both sciences. By making comparisons across cultural traditions (time-based) and cultural regions (space-based), anthropologists have developed various kinds of <a href="/wiki/Comparative_method" class="mw-redirect" title="Comparative method">comparative method</a>, a central part of their science.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Commonalities_between_fields">Commonalities between fields</span></h3>
<p>Because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises (see <a href="/wiki/History_of_Anthropology" class="mw-redirect" title="History of Anthropology">History of Anthropology</a>), including but not limited to <a href="/wiki/Fossil_collecting" title="Fossil collecting">fossil-hunting</a>, <a href="/wiki/Exploration" title="Exploration">exploring</a>, documentary film-making, <a href="/wiki/Paleontology" title="Paleontology">paleontology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Primatology" title="Primatology">primatology</a>, antiquity dealings and curatorship, <a href="/wiki/Philology" title="Philology">philology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Etymology" title="Etymology">etymology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Genetics" title="Genetics">genetics</a>, regional analysis, <a href="/wiki/Ethnology" title="Ethnology">ethnology</a>, history, <a href="/wiki/Philosophy" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Religious_studies" title="Religious studies">religious studies</a>, it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article, although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made.</p>
<p>Some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of &quot;other cultures&quot;, both in terms of time (past societies) and space (non-European/non-Western societies). For example, the classic of <a href="/wiki/Urban_anthropology" title="Urban anthropology">urban anthropology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ulf_Hannerz" title="Ulf Hannerz">Ulf Hannerz</a> in the introduction to his seminal <i>Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology</i> mentions that the &quot;<a href="/wiki/Third_World" title="Third World">Third World</a>&quot; had habitually received most of attention; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in &quot;other cultures&quot; looked for them far away and started to look &quot;across the tracks&quot; only in late 1960s.</p>
<p>Now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the author&apos;s &quot;home&quot;. It is also argued that other fields of study, like History and <a href="/wiki/Sociology" title="Sociology">Sociology</a>, on the contrary focus disproportionately on the West.</p>
<p>In France, the study of Western societies has been traditionally left to <a href="/wiki/Sociologist" class="mw-redirect" title="Sociologist">sociologists</a>, but this is increasingly changing, starting in the 1970s from scholars like Isac Chiva and journals like <i><a href="/wiki/Terrain_(journal)" title="Terrain (journal)">Terrain</a></i> (&quot;fieldwork&quot;), and developing with the center founded by <a href="/wiki/Marc_Aug%C3%A9" title="Marc Aug&#xE9;">Marc Aug&#xE9;</a> (<i><a href="/wiki/%C3%89cole_des_hautes_%C3%A9tudes_en_sciences_sociales" class="mw-redirect" title="&#xC9;cole des hautes &#xE9;tudes en sciences sociales">Le Centre d&apos;anthropologie des mondes contemporains</a></i>, the Anthropological Research Center of Contemporary Societies).</p>
<p>Since the 1980s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the North Atlantic region, frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale. There has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people; increasingly, research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories, social movements, governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses.</p>
