<p><b>Philosophy</b> (from <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#x3C6;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3C6;&#x3AF;&#x3B1;</span>, <i>philosophia</i>, literally &quot;love of wisdom&quot;) is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by <a href="/wiki/Pythagoras" title="Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a> (c. 570 &#x2013; c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, <a href="/wiki/Socratic_method" title="Socratic method">critical discussion</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dialectic" title="Dialectic">rational argument</a> and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to <a href="/wiki/Pyrrhonism" title="Pyrrhonism">know anything</a> and to prove it? What is <a href="/wiki/Absolute_(philosophy)" title="Absolute (philosophy)">most real</a>? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a <a href="/wiki/Taoism" title="Taoism">best way to live</a>? Is it better to be <a href="/wiki/Justice" title="Justice">just or unjust</a> (if you can get away with it)? Do humans have <a href="/wiki/Free_will" title="Free will">free will</a>?</p><p>Historically, &quot;philosophy&quot; encompassed any body of knowledge.

In the 19th century, the growth of modern <a href="/wiki/University" title="University">research universities</a> led academic philosophy and other disciplines to <a href="/wiki/Contemporary_philosophy" title="Contemporary philosophy">professionalize</a> and specialize. In the modern era, some investigations that were traditionally part of philosophy became separate academic disciplines, including <a href="/wiki/Psychology" title="Psychology">psychology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sociology" title="Sociology">sociology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Linguistics" title="Linguistics">linguistics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Economics" title="Economics">economics</a>.</p><p>Other investigations closely related to art, science, politics, or other pursuits remained part of philosophy.

However, many of those who study philosophy in undergraduate or graduate programs contribute in the fields of law, journalism, politics, religion, science, business and various art and entertainment activities.</p><p>In one sense, philosophy is synonymous with wisdom or learning. In that sense, all cultures have a philosophical tradition.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Western_philosophy" title="Western philosophy">Western philosophy</a> dates to the Greek philosophers, who were active in <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greece</a> beginning in the 6th century BC. <a href="/wiki/Pythagoras" title="Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a> distinguished himself from other &quot;wise ones&quot; by calling himself a mere <i>lover of wisdom</i>, suggesting that he was not wise. <a href="/wiki/Socrates" title="Socrates">Socrates</a> used this title and insisted that he possessed no <i>wisdom</i> but was a <i>pursuer of</i> wisdom. Socrates&apos; student <a href="/wiki/Plato" title="Plato">Plato</a> is often credited as the founder of Western philosophy. The philosopher <a href="/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead" title="Alfred North Whitehead">Alfred North Whitehead</a> said of Plato: &quot;The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato. I do not mean the systematic scheme of thought which scholars have doubtfully extracted from his writings. I allude to the wealth of general ideas scattered through them.&quot;</p><p>Eastern philosophy is a term that encompasses the many philosophical currents originating outside Europe, including <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a>, <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>, <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Persian_Empire" title="Persian Empire">Persia</a> and other regions. They have their own timelines, regions and philosophers. Major traditions include:</p><p>Traditionally, the term &quot;philosophy&quot; referred to any body of knowledge. In this sense, philosophy is closely related to religion, mathematics, natural science, education and politics. Newton&apos;s 1687 &quot;<a href="/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica" title="Philosophi&#xE6; Naturalis Principia Mathematica">Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy</a>&quot; is classified in the 2000s as a book of physics; he used the term &quot;<a href="/wiki/Natural_philosophy" title="Natural philosophy">natural philosophy</a>&quot; because it used to encompass disciplines that later became associated with sciences such as <a href="/wiki/Astronomy" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Medicine" title="Medicine">medicine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Physics" title="Physics">physics</a>.</p><p>Philosophy was traditionally divided into three major branches:</p><p>This division is not obsolete but has changed. Natural philosophy has split into the various natural sciences, especially astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology and cosmology. Moral philosophy has birthed the social sciences, but still includes value theory (including aesthetics, ethics, political philosophy, etc.). Metaphysical philosophy has birthed formal sciences such as logic, mathematics and philosophy of science, but still includes epistemology, cosmology and others.</p><p>Many philosophical debates that began in ancient times are still debated today. <a href="/wiki/Colin_McGinn" title="Colin McGinn">Colin McGinn</a>tand others claim that no <a href="/wiki/Philosophical_progress" title="Philosophical progress">philosophical progress</a> has occurred during that interval. <a href="/wiki/David_Chalmers" title="David Chalmers">Chalmers</a> and others, by contrast, see progress in philosophy similar to that in science, while Talbot Brewer argued that &quot;progress&quot; is the wrong standard by which to judge philosophical activity.</p><p>Philosopher questions can be grouped into categories. These groupings allow philosophers to focus on a set of similar topics and interact with other thinkers who are interested in the same questions. The groupings also make philosophy easier for students to approach. Students can learn the basic principles involved in one aspect of the field without being overwhelmed with the entire set of philosophical theories.</p><p>Various sources present different categorical schemes. The categories adopted in this article aim for breadth and simplicity.</p><p>These five major branches can be separated into sub-branches and each sub-branch contains many specific fields of study.</p><p>These divisions are neither exhaustive, nor mutually exclusive. (A philosopher might specialize in <a href="/wiki/Kant" class="mw-redirect" title="Kant">Kantian</a> epistemology, or <a href="/wiki/Plato" title="Plato">Platonic</a> aesthetics, or modern political philosophy.) Furthermore, these philosophical inquiries sometimes overlap with each other and with other inquiries such as science, religion or mathematics.</p><p>Metaphysics is the study of the most general features of <a href="/wiki/Reality" title="Reality">reality</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Existence" title="Existence">existence</a>, <a href="/wiki/Time" title="Time">time</a>, <a href="/wiki/Object_(philosophy)" title="Object (philosophy)">objects</a> and their <a href="/wiki/Property_(philosophy)" title="Property (philosophy)">properties</a>, wholes and their parts, events, processes and <a href="/wiki/Causality" title="Causality">causation</a> and the relationship between <a href="/wiki/Mind" title="Mind">mind</a> and <a href="/wiki/Human_body" title="Human body">body</a>. Metaphysics includes <a href="/wiki/Cosmology" title="Cosmology">cosmology</a>, the study of the <a href="/wiki/World" title="World">world</a> in its entirety and <a href="/wiki/Ontology" title="Ontology">ontology</a>, the study of <a href="/wiki/Being" title="Being">being</a>.</p><p>Epistemology is the study of knowledge (Greek episteme). Epistemologists study the putative sources of knowledge, including intuition, a priori reason, memory, perceptual knowledge, self-knowledge and testimony. They also ask: What is <a href="/wiki/Truth" title="Truth">truth</a>? Is knowledge justified true belief? Are any beliefs <a href="/wiki/Theory_of_justification" title="Theory of justification">justified</a>? Putative knowledge includes propositional knowledge (knowledge that something is the case), know-how (knowledge of how to do something) and acquaintance (familiarity with someone or something). Epistemologists examine these and ask whether knowledge is really possible.</p><p>Among the numerous topics within metaphysics and epistemology, broadly construed are:</p><p>Value theory (or <a href="/wiki/Axiology" title="Axiology">axiology</a>) is the major branch of philosophy that addresses topics such as goodness, beauty and justice. Value theory includes ethics, aesthetics, political philosophy, feminist philosophy, philosophy of law and more.</p><p>Ethics, or &quot;moral philosophy&quot;, studies and considers what is good and bad <a href="/wiki/Action_(philosophy)" title="Action (philosophy)">conduct</a>, right and <a href="/wiki/Wrong" class="mw-redirect" title="Wrong">wrong</a> <a href="/wiki/Values_(philosophy)" class="mw-redirect" title="Values (philosophy)">values</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Good_and_evil" title="Good and evil">good and evil</a>.

It is more precisely defined as the study of <a href="/wiki/Senses" class="mw-redirect" title="Senses">sensory</a> or sensori-emotional values, sometimes called <a href="/wiki/Judgment" class="mw-redirect" title="Judgment">judgments</a> of <a href="/wiki/Feeling" title="Feeling">sentiment</a> and taste.

An example from art theory is to discern the set of principles underlying the work of a particular artist or artistic movement such as the <a href="/wiki/Cubist" class="mw-redirect" title="Cubist">Cubist</a> aesthetic. The <a href="/wiki/Philosophy_of_film" title="Philosophy of film">philosophy of film</a> analyzes films and filmmakers for their philosophical content and explores film (images, cinema, etc.) as a medium for philosophical reflection and expression.</p><p>Political philosophy is the study of <a href="/wiki/Government" title="Government">government</a> and the relationship of individuals (or families and clans) to communities including the <a href="/wiki/State_(polity)" title="State (polity)">state</a>. It includes questions about justice, law, property and the rights and obligations of the citizen. Politics and ethics are traditionally linked subjects, as both discuss the question of what how people should live together.</p><p>Other branches of value theory:</p><p>There are a variety of branches of value theory.</p><p>Many academic disciplines generated philosophical inquiry. The relationship between &quot;X&quot; and the &quot;philosophy of X&quot; is debated. <a href="/wiki/Richard_Feynman" title="Richard Feynman">Richard Feynman</a> argued that the philosophy of a topic is irrelevant to its primary study, saying that &quot;<a href="/wiki/Philosophy_of_science" title="Philosophy of science">philosophy of science</a> is as useful to scientists as <a href="/wiki/Ornithology" title="Ornithology">ornithology</a> is to birds.&quot; <a href="/wiki/Curtis_White" class="mw-disambig" title="Curtis White">Curtis White</a>, by contrast, argued that philosophical tools are essential to humanities, sciences and social sciences.</p><p>Its topics are numbers, symbols and the formal methods of reasoning as employed in the social and natural sciences.</p><p>Logic is the study of reasoning and argument. An argument is &quot;<i>a</i> <i>connected series of statements intended to establish a proposition</i>.&quot; The connected series of statements are &quot;<a href="/wiki/Premise" title="Premise">premises</a>&quot; and the proposition is the conclusion.

Of the many Chinese philosophical schools, only Confucianism and Taoism survived the <a href="/wiki/Qin_Dynasty" class="mw-redirect" title="Qin Dynasty">Qin Dynasty</a>&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Burning_of_books_and_burying_of_scholars" title="Burning of books and burying of scholars">suppression of any Chinese philosophy</a> that opposed Legalism.</p><p>Confucianism is <a href="/wiki/Humanism" title="Humanism">humanistic</a>, claiming that humans are teachable, improvable and perfectible through individual and communal endeavour, specifically including self-cultivation and self-creation. Confucianism focuses on the cultivation of virtue and maintenance of ethics, the most basic of which are <i>ren</i>, <i>yi</i> and <i>li</i>. <i>Ren</i> is an obligation of <a href="/wiki/Altruism" title="Altruism">altruism</a> and humanity towards other individuals within a community, <i>yi</i> is the upholding of righteousness and the moral disposition to do good and <i>li</i> is a system of norms and propriety that determines how a person should properly act within a community.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Taoism" title="Taoism">Taoism</a> focuses on establishing harmony with the <a href="/wiki/Tao" title="Tao">Tao</a>, which is the origin of and the totality of everything that exists. The word &quot;Tao&quot; (or &quot;Dao&quot;, depending on the <a href="/wiki/Romanization" title="Romanization">romanization</a> scheme) is usually translated as &quot;way&quot;, &quot;path&quot; or &quot;principle&quot;.

It is usually divided into three periods: the <a href="/wiki/Pre-Socratic_philosophy" title="Pre-Socratic philosophy">pre-Socratic period</a>, the Ancient Classical Greek period of <a href="/wiki/Plato" title="Plato">Plato</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> and the post-Aristotelian (or <a href="/wiki/Hellenistic_period" title="Hellenistic period">Hellenistic</a>) period. A possible fourth period includes the <a href="/wiki/Neoplatonic" class="mw-redirect" title="Neoplatonic">Neoplatonic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Christian" title="Christian">Christian</a> philosophers of <a href="/wiki/Late_Antiquity" title="Late Antiquity">Late Antiquity</a>. The most important of the ancient philosophers in terms of subsequent influence are Plato and Aristotle. Roman Ancient history asserted that <a href="/wiki/Pythagoras" title="Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a> was the first to call himself a philosopher, or lover of wisdom. Pythagorean ideas exercised a marked influence on Plato and through him, all of <a href="/wiki/Western_philosophy" title="Western philosophy">Western philosophy</a>. Plato and Aristotle, the first <a href="/wiki/Classical_Greece" title="Classical Greece">Classical Greek</a> philosophers, referred critically to other simple &quot;wise men&quot;, who were called &quot;<a href="/wiki/Sophist" title="Sophist">sophists</a>,&quot; and who were common before Pythagoras&apos; time. This critique may imply a contemporaneous distinction between the &quot;lovers of wisdom&quot; (the true Philosophers) and other earlier and more common traveling teachers.</p><p>The main subjects of ancient philosophy are: the fundamental causes and principles of the <a href="/wiki/Universe" title="Universe">universe</a>; reconciling the diversity and change of the natural universe with the possibility of obtaining fixed and certain knowledge about it; questions about things that cannot be perceived by the senses, such as <a href="/wiki/Number" title="Number">numbers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Classical_element" title="Classical element">elements</a>, <a href="/wiki/Universals" class="mw-redirect" title="Universals">universals</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gods" class="mw-redirect" title="Gods">gods</a>. Socrates is said to have been the initiator of more focused study upon human elements, including the analysis of patterns of <a href="/wiki/Reasoning" class="mw-redirect" title="Reasoning">reasoning</a> and argument and the nature of <a href="/wiki/The_good_life" title="The good life">the good life</a> and the importance of understanding and knowledge in order to pursue it; the explication of the concept of <a href="/wiki/Justice" title="Justice">justice</a> and its relation to various <a href="/wiki/Political_systems" class="mw-redirect" title="Political systems">political systems</a>.</p><p>In this period the crucial features of the Western <a href="/wiki/Philosophical_method" class="mw-redirect" title="Philosophical method">philosophical method</a> were established: a critical approach to established views and the appeal to reason and argumentation. This includes Socrates&apos; <a href="/wiki/Dialectic" title="Dialectic">dialectic</a> method of inquiry, known as the <a href="/wiki/Socratic_method" title="Socratic method">Socratic method</a> or method of &quot;elenchus&quot;, which he largely applied to the examination of key moral concepts such as the Good and <a href="/wiki/Justice" title="Justice">Justice</a>. To solve a problem, it would be broken down into a series of questions, the answers to which gradually yield the desirred answer. The influence of this approach is most strongly felt today in the use of the <a href="/wiki/Scientific_method" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a>, in which <a href="/wiki/Hypothesis" title="Hypothesis">hypothesis</a> is the first step.</p><p>The term Indian philosophy (Sanskrit: <i>Darshanas</i>), encompasses several schools that originated in the <a href="/wiki/Indian_subcontinent" title="Indian subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Hindu_philosophy" title="Hindu philosophy">Hindu philosophy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Buddhist_philosophy" title="Buddhist philosophy">Buddhist philosophy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jain_philosophy" title="Jain philosophy">Jain philosophy</a>.

Medieval philosophy began with the rediscovery and further development of classical <a href="/wiki/Greek_philosophy" class="mw-redirect" title="Greek philosophy">Greek</a> and Hellenistic philosophy and attempted to address theological problems and to integrate the sacred doctrines of <a href="/wiki/Abrahamic_religion" class="mw-redirect" title="Abrahamic religion">Abrahamic religion</a> (<a href="/wiki/Islam" title="Islam">Islam</a>, <a href="/wiki/Judaism" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>) with <a href="/wiki/Secularism" title="Secularism">secular</a> learning.

Yet this period of nearly a thousand years was the longest period of philosophical development in Europe and possibly the richest. <a href="/wiki/Jorge_Gracia" class="mw-redirect" title="Jorge Gracia">Jorge Gracia</a> argued that &quot;in intensity, sophistication and achievement, the philosophical flowering in the thirteenth century could be rightly said to rival the golden age of Greek philosophy in the fourth century B.C.&quot; Major topics included the relation of <a href="/wiki/Faith" title="Faith">faith</a> to <a href="/wiki/Reason" title="Reason">reason</a>, the existence and unity of <a href="/wiki/God" title="God">God</a>, the object of <a href="/wiki/Theology" title="Theology">theology</a> and <a href="/wiki/Metaphysics" title="Metaphysics">metaphysics</a>, knowledge, of universals and of individuation.</p><p>Major thinkers include Christian philosophers <a href="/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo" title="Augustine of Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Boethius" title="Boethius">Boethius</a>, <a href="/wiki/Anselm_of_Canterbury" title="Anselm of Canterbury">Anselm</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gilbert_of_Poitiers" class="mw-redirect" title="Gilbert of Poitiers">Gilbert of Poitiers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Abelard" title="Peter Abelard">Peter Abelard</a>, <a href="/wiki/Roger_Bacon" title="Roger Bacon">Roger Bacon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bonaventure" title="Bonaventure">Bonaventure</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas" title="Thomas Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Duns_Scotus" title="Duns Scotus">Duns Scotus</a>, <a href="/wiki/William_of_Ockham" title="William of Ockham">William of Ockham</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jean_Buridan" title="Jean Buridan">Jean Buridan</a>; the Jewish philosophers <a href="/wiki/Maimonides" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gersonides" title="Gersonides">Gersonides</a>; and the <a href="/wiki/Muslim" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> philosophers <a href="/wiki/Al-Kindi" title="Al-Kindi">Alkindus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Al-Farabi" title="Al-Farabi">Alfarabi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham" class="mw-redirect" title="Ibn al-Haytham">Alhazen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Avicenna" title="Avicenna">Avicenna</a>, <a href="/wiki/Al-Ghazali" title="Al-Ghazali">Algazel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ibn_Bajjah" class="mw-redirect" title="Ibn Bajjah">Avempace</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ibn_Tufail" title="Ibn Tufail">Abubacer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ibn_Khald%C5%ABn" class="mw-redirect" title="Ibn Khald&#x16B;n">Ibn Khald&#x16B;n</a> and <a href="/wiki/Averroes" title="Averroes">Averroes</a>. <a href="/wiki/Scholasticism" title="Scholasticism">Scholasticism</a> continued to flourish as late as the 17th century, via <a href="/wiki/Francisco_Suarez" class="mw-redirect" title="Francisco Suarez">Francisco Suarez</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_of_St._Thomas" title="John of St. Thomas">John of St. Thomas</a>. Aquinas, the father of <a href="/wiki/Thomism" title="Thomism">Thomism</a>, was influential in Catholic Europe; he placed a great emphasis on reason and argumentation and was one of the first to use the new translation of Aristotle&apos;s metaphysical and epistemological writing. His work was a significant departure from the <a href="/wiki/Neoplatonic" class="mw-redirect" title="Neoplatonic">Neoplatonic</a> and Augustinian thinking that dominated early Scholasticism.</p><p>The Renaissance (&quot;rebirth&quot;) was a period of transition between the Middle Ages and modern thought, in which the recovery of classical texts helped shift philosophical interests away from technical studies in logic, metaphysics and theology towards eclectic inquiries into morality, philology and mysticism. The study of the classics and the humanities generally, such as history and literature, enjoyed a scholarly interest hitherto unknown in Christendom, a tendency referred to as <a href="/wiki/Humanism" title="Humanism">humanism</a>. Displacing the medieval interest in metaphysics and logic, the humanists followed <a href="/wiki/Petrarch" title="Petrarch">Petrarch</a> in making man and his virtues the focus of philosophy.</p><p>The study of classical philosophy developed in two new ways. On the one hand, the study of Aristotle was changed through the influence of <a href="/wiki/Averroism" title="Averroism">Averroism</a>. The disagreements between Averroist Aristotelians and more orthodox Catholic Aristotelians such as <a href="/wiki/Albertus_Magnus" title="Albertus Magnus">Albertus Magnus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas" title="Thomas Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> eventually contributed to the development of a &quot;humanist Aristotelianism&quot; developed in the Renaissance, as exemplified in the thought of <a href="/wiki/Pietro_Pomponazzi" title="Pietro Pomponazzi">Pietro Pomponazzi</a> and <a href="/wiki/Giacomo_Zabarella" class="mw-redirect" title="Giacomo Zabarella">Giacomo Zabarella</a>. Secondly, as an alternative to Aristotle, the study of Plato and the <a href="/wiki/Neoplatonists" class="mw-redirect" title="Neoplatonists">Neoplatonists</a> became common. This was assisted by the rediscovery of works that were not well known in Western Europe. Notable Renaissance Platonists include <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_of_Cusa" title="Nicholas of Cusa">Nicholas of Cusa</a> and later <a href="/wiki/Marsilio_Ficino" title="Marsilio Ficino">Marsilio Ficino</a> and <a href="/wiki/Giovanni_Pico_della_Mirandola" title="Giovanni Pico della Mirandola">Giovanni Pico della Mirandola</a>.</p><p>The Renaissance also renewed interest in anti-Aristotelian theories of nature considered as an organic, living whole comprehensible independently of theology, as in the work of <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_of_Cusa" title="Nicholas of Cusa">Nicholas of Cusa</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_Copernicus" class="mw-redirect" title="Nicholas Copernicus">Nicholas Copernicus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Giordano_Bruno" title="Giordano Bruno">Giordano Bruno</a>, <a href="/wiki/Telesius" class="mw-redirect" title="Telesius">Telesius</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tommaso_Campanella" title="Tommaso Campanella">Tommaso Campanella</a>. Such movements in natural philosophy dovetailed with a revival of interest in <a href="/wiki/Occultism" class="mw-redirect" title="Occultism">occultism</a>, magic, <a href="/wiki/Hermeticism" title="Hermeticism">hermeticism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Astrology" title="Astrology">astrology</a>, which were thought to yield hidden ways of knowing and mastering nature (e.g., Ficino and Mirandola). These new movements in philosophy developed contemporaneously with larger religious and political transformations in Europe: the <a href="/wiki/Protestant_Reformation" title="Protestant Reformation">Reformation</a> and the decline of <a href="/wiki/Feudalism" title="Feudalism">feudalism</a>. Though the theologians of the Protestant Reformation showed little direct interest in philosophy, their destruction of the traditional foundations of theological and intellectual authority harmonized with a revival of <a href="/wiki/Fideism" title="Fideism">fideism</a> and skepticism in thinkers such as <a href="/wiki/Erasmus" class="mw-redirect" title="Erasmus">Erasmus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Montaigne" class="mw-redirect" title="Montaigne">Montaigne</a> and <a href="/wiki/Francisco_Sanches" title="Francisco Sanches">Francisco Sanches</a>. Meanwhile, the gradual centralization of political power in nation-states was echoed by the emergence of secular political philosophies, as in the works of <a href="/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Machiavelli" title="Niccol&#xF2; Machiavelli">Niccol&#xF2; Machiavelli</a> (described as the first modern political thinker), <a href="/wiki/Thomas_More" title="Thomas More">Thomas More</a>, Erasmus, <a href="/wiki/Justus_Lipsius" title="Justus Lipsius">Justus Lipsius</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jean_Bodin" title="Jean Bodin">Jean Bodin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hugo_Grotius" title="Hugo Grotius">Hugo Grotius</a>.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Mid-Imperial_China" class="mw-redirect" title="Mid-Imperial China">Mid-Imperial Chinese</a> philosophy is primarily defined by the development of <a href="/wiki/Neo-Confucianism" title="Neo-Confucianism">Neo-Confucianism</a>. During the <a href="/wiki/Tang_Dynasty" class="mw-redirect" title="Tang Dynasty">Tang Dynasty</a>, Buddhism from <a href="/wiki/Buddhism_in_Nepal" title="Buddhism in Nepal">Nepal</a> spread throughout China. (Philosophy and religion were clearly separate in the West, but were more continuous in the East due to, for example, Buddhism&apos;s philosophical concepts.)</p><p><a href="/wiki/Neo-Confucianism" title="Neo-Confucianism">Neo-Confucianism</a> is a philosophical movement that advocated a more rationalist and secular form of <a href="/wiki/Confucianism" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> by rejecting superstitious and mystical elements of <a href="/wiki/Daoism" class="mw-redirect" title="Daoism">Daoism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Buddhism" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> that had influenced Confucianism during and after the Han Dynasty. Although the Neo-Confucianists were critical of Daoism and Buddhism, the two did have an influence on the philosophy and the Neo-Confucianists borrowed terms and concepts from both. However, unlike the Buddhists and Daoists, who saw <a href="/wiki/Metaphysics" title="Metaphysics">metaphysics</a> as a catalyst for spiritual development, religious enlightenment and immortality, the Neo-Confucianists used metaphysics as a guide for developing a rationalist <a href="/wiki/Ethics" title="Ethics">ethical</a> philosophy. Neo-Confucianism had its origins in the <a href="/wiki/Tang_Dynasty" class="mw-redirect" title="Tang Dynasty">Tang Dynasty</a>; the Confucianist scholars <a href="/wiki/Han_Yu" title="Han Yu">Han Yu</a> and <a href="/wiki/Li_Ao" title="Li Ao">Li Ao</a> were the forbears of the Neo-Confucianists of the Song Dynasty. The Song Dynasty philosopher <a href="/wiki/Zhou_Dunyi" title="Zhou Dunyi">Zhou Dunyi</a> is seen as the first true &quot;pioneer&quot; of Neo-Confucianism, using Daoist metaphysics as a framework for his ethical philosophy. Elsewhere in East Asia, <a href="/wiki/Japanese_Philosophy" class="mw-redirect" title="Japanese Philosophy">Japanese Philosophy</a> began to develop as indigenous <a href="/wiki/Shinto" title="Shinto">Shinto</a> beliefs fused with Buddhism, Confucianism and other schools of <a href="/wiki/Chinese_philosophy" title="Chinese philosophy">Chinese</a> and <a href="/wiki/Indian_philosophy" title="Indian philosophy">Indian philosophy</a>. As in Japan, <a href="/wiki/Korean_philosophy" title="Korean philosophy">Korean philosophy</a> integrated the emotional content of <a href="/wiki/Korean_Shamanism" class="mw-redirect" title="Korean Shamanism">Shamanism</a> into Neo-Confucianism. <a href="/wiki/Vietnamese_philosophy" title="Vietnamese philosophy">Vietnamese philosophy</a> also became influenced heavily by Confucianism.</p><p>The period between 5th and 9th centuries CE was the most prominent epoch in the development of Indian philosophy as Hindu and Buddhist philosophies both flourished. The non-dualistic <a href="/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta" title="Advaita Vedanta">Advaita Vedanta</a> emerged as the most influential and most dominant school. The major philosophers of this school were <a href="/wiki/Gaudapada" title="Gaudapada">Gaudapada</a>, <a href="/wiki/Adi_Shankara" title="Adi Shankara">Adi Shankara</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vidyaranya" title="Vidyaranya">Vidyaranya</a>. Advaita Vedanta rejected theism and dualism by insisting that &quot;<a href="/wiki/Brahman" title="Brahman">Brahman</a> [ultimate reality] is without parts or attributes...one without a second.&quot; Since Brahman has no properties, contains no internal diversity and is identical with the whole reality, it cannot be understood as God. (Indescribable) Brahman is best described as Satchidananda (merging &quot;Sat&quot; + &quot;Chit&quot; + &quot;Ananda&quot;, i.e., existence, consciousness and bliss). Advaita ushered in new schools of thought in the medieval period, including <a href="/wiki/Visishtadvaita" class="mw-redirect" title="Visishtadvaita">Visishtadvaita</a> (qualified monism), <a href="/wiki/Dvaita" title="Dvaita">Dvaita</a> (dualism), <a href="/wiki/Dvaitadvaita" title="Dvaitadvaita">Dvaitadvaita</a> (dualism-nondualism), <a href="/wiki/Suddhadvaita" class="mw-redirect" title="Suddhadvaita">Suddhadvaita</a> (pure non-dualism), <a href="/wiki/Achintya_Bheda_Abheda" title="Achintya Bheda Abheda">Achintya Bheda Abheda</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pratyabhijna" title="Pratyabhijna">Pratyabhij&#xF1;a</a> (the recognitive school).</p><p>Early Islamic thought refers to philosophy during the &quot;<a href="/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age" title="Islamic Golden Age">Islamic Golden Age</a>&quot;, traditionally dated between the 8th and 12th centuries. One main school was <a href="/wiki/Kalam" title="Kalam">Kalam</a>, which mainly dealt with <a href="/wiki/Islamic_theology" class="mw-redirect" title="Islamic theology">Islamic theological</a> questions such as the <a href="/wiki/Mu%27tazili" class="mw-redirect" title="Mu&apos;tazili">Mu&apos;tazili</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ash%27ari" title="Ash&apos;ari">Ash&apos;ari</a>. The other school was <a href="/wiki/Philosophy#Falsafa" title="Philosophy">Falsafa</a>, which was founded on interpretations of Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism. Later philosopher-theologians attempted to harmonize the two, notably by Ibn Sina (Avicenna) who founded <a href="/wiki/Avicennism" title="Avicennism">Avicennism</a>, Ibn Rushd (Averro&#xEB;s) who founded <a href="/wiki/Averroism" title="Averroism">Averroism</a> and others such as <a href="/wiki/Alhacen" class="mw-redirect" title="Alhacen">Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen)</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ab%C5%AB_Rayh%C4%81n_al-B%C4%ABr%C5%ABn%C4%AB" class="mw-redirect" title="Ab&#x16B; Rayh&#x101;n al-B&#x12B;r&#x16B;n&#x12B;">Ab&#x16B; Rayh&#x101;n al-B&#x12B;r&#x16B;n&#x12B;</a>. Avicenna developedhis &quot;Floating Man&quot; thought experiment concerning <a href="/wiki/Self-awareness" title="Self-awareness">Self-awareness</a>, in which a man isolated from sense experience (e.g., blindfolded and free falling) would still be aware of his existence.

It arises from the confluence of <a href="/wiki/Greeks" title="Greeks">Greek</a> and <a href="/wiki/Patristic" class="mw-redirect" title="Patristic">Patristic</a> philosophy with traditional Ethiopian modes of thought. Ethiopian thinkers were also influenced by Arabic thought. The literature developed under these circumstances is the result of a twofold effort of creative assimilation. <a href="/wiki/Orthodoxy" title="Orthodoxy">Orthodox Christianity</a> combined with Greek pagan and early Patristic thought into an Ethiopian-Christian synthesis. The moral reflection of religious inspiration was prevalent and the use of narrative, <a href="/wiki/Parable" title="Parable">parable</a>, <a href="/wiki/Apothegm" class="mw-redirect" title="Apothegm">apothegm</a> and rich imagery outweighed the use of abstract argument. This literature includes adaptations of Greek texts, including the <i>Physiolog</i> (cca. 5th century A.D.), <i>The Life and Maxims of Skendes</i> (11th century A.D.) and <i>The Book of the Wise Philosophers</i> (1510/22). In the 17th century, Ethiopians&apos; religious beliefs were challenged by King <a href="/wiki/Susenyos_of_Ethiopia" class="mw-redirect" title="Susenyos of Ethiopia">Suseynos</a>&apos; adoption of Catholicism and by the subsequent presence of Jesuit missionaries. The attempt to forcefully impose religion inspired further development of Ethiopian philosophy during the 17th century. <a href="/wiki/Zera_Yacob" class="mw-redirect" title="Zera Yacob">Zera Yacob</a> (1599&#x2013;1692) was the most important exponent. His treatise <i><a href="/wiki/Hatata" title="Hatata">Hatata</a></i> (1667) is often included in the canon of universal philosophy.</p><p>The early modern era of Western philosophy occupied the 17th and 18th centuries.The 18th century is often referred to as the beginning of the <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" title="Age of Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>, when <a href="/wiki/Reason" title="Reason">reason</a>&#xA0;became celebrated as the primary source of&#xA0;<a href="/wiki/Authority" title="Authority">authority</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a href="/wiki/Legitimacy_(political)" title="Legitimacy (political)">legitimacy</a>, along with the ideals of <a href="/wiki/Liberty" title="Liberty">liberty</a>,&#xA0;equality,&#xA0;<a href="/wiki/Toleration" title="Toleration">tolerance</a>,&#xA0;<a href="/wiki/Fraternity" title="Fraternity">fraternity</a>,&#xA0;<a href="/wiki/Constitutional_government" class="mw-redirect" title="Constitutional government">constitutional government</a>&#xA0;and <a href="/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state" title="Separation of church and state">limits on the power of the church over the state</a>.

Other central topics in this period include the nature of the mind and its relation to the body, the implications of the natural sciences for traditional theological topics such as free will and God and the emergence of a secular basis for moral and political philosophy.

The approximate end of the early modern period is most often identified with <a href="/wiki/Immanuel_Kant" title="Immanuel Kant">Kant</a>&apos;s systematic attempt to limit metaphysics, justify scientific knowledge and reconcile both of these with morality and freedom.</p><p>Later modern philosophy began with the 19th century. German philosophers exercised broad influence in this century, owing in part to the dominance of the German university system. <a href="/wiki/German_idealist" class="mw-redirect" title="German idealist">German idealists</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte" title="Johann Gottlieb Fichte">Fichte</a>, <a href="/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel" title="Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel">Hegel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Joseph_Schelling" title="Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling">Schelling</a>, transformed the work of Kant by maintaining that the world is constituted by a rational or mind-like process and as such is entirely knowable. <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer" title="Arthur Schopenhauer">Schopenhauer</a>&apos;s identification of this world-constituting process as an irrational <a href="/wiki/Will_to_live" title="Will to live">will to live</a> influenced later thinking, such including <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Nietzsche</a>. After Hegel&apos;s death in 1831, 19th-century philosophy largely turned against idealism in favor of varieties of philosophical <a href="/wiki/Naturalism_(philosophy)" title="Naturalism (philosophy)">naturalism</a>, exemplified by <a href="/wiki/Auguste_Comte" title="Auguste Comte">Comte</a> (<a href="/wiki/Positivism" title="Positivism">positivism</a>), <a href="/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill" title="John Stuart Mill">Mill</a> (empiricism) and <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Marx</a> (materialism). Logic made significant advances, as increasing mathematical understanding opened fields of inference to formalization in the work of <a href="/wiki/George_Boole" title="George Boole">Boole</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gottlob_Frege" title="Gottlob Frege">Frege</a>. Other philosophers who initiated lines of thought that would continue to shape philosophy into the 20th century include <a href="/wiki/Henry_Sidgwick" title="Henry Sidgwick">Sidgwick</a> (ethics), <a href="/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce" title="Charles Sanders Peirce">Peirce</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_James" title="William James">James</a> (<a href="/wiki/Pragmatism" title="Pragmatism">pragmatism</a>) and <a href="/wiki/S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard" title="S&#xF8;ren Kierkegaard">Kierkegaard</a> (<a href="/wiki/Existentialism" title="Existentialism">existentialism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Post-structuralism" title="Post-structuralism">post-structuralism</a>).</p><p>In the twentieth century, philosophy became a professional discipline practiced within universities. It became less general and more specialized. In the view of one prominent recent historian: &quot;Philosophy has become a highly organized discipline, done by specialists primarily for other specialists. The number of philosophers has exploded, the volume of publication has swelled and the subfields of serious philosophical investigation have multiplied. Not only is the broad field of philosophy today far too vast to be embraced by one mind, something similar is true even of many highly specialized subfields.&quot; Briggle and Frodeman argued that this professionalization has negatively affected the discipline.</p><p>In the English-speaking world, <a href="/wiki/Analytic_philosophy" title="Analytic philosophy">analytic philosophy</a> dominated much of the 20th century. In the first half of the century, it was a cohesive school, shaped strongly by <a href="/wiki/Logical_positivism" title="Logical positivism">logical positivism</a>, united by the notion that philosophical problems could and should be solved by attention to <a href="/wiki/Logic" title="Logic">logic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Language" title="Language">language</a>. <a href="/wiki/Bertrand_Russell" title="Bertrand Russell">Russell</a> was a model for its early development, moving from a rejection of the idealism dominant in late 19th-century British philosophy to a neo-Humean empiricism, strengthened by the conceptual resources of modern mathematical logic. In the latter half of the 20th century, analytic philosophy diffused into a wide variety of disparate views.</p><p>After <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War 2</a> the analytic program developed an interest in ordinary language as a way of avoiding or redescribing traditional philosophical problems and to a <a href="/wiki/Naturalized_epistemology" title="Naturalized epistemology">naturalism</a> that sought to dissolve philosophical puzzles via progress in the natural sciences (such as cognitive psychology and evolutionary biology). <a href="/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein" title="Ludwig Wittgenstein">Wittgenstein</a>&apos;s attack on traditional philosophy as a linguistic misunderstanding of normal forms of life, was the most influential. The later work of Russell and of <a href="/wiki/Willard_Van_Orman_Quine" title="Willard Van Orman Quine">Quine</a> are influential exemplars of the naturalist approach. The diversity of analytic philosophy from the 1970s onward defies generalization: the naturalism of Quine and his followers led to a &quot;new metaphysics&quot; of <a href="/wiki/Possible_worlds" class="mw-redirect" title="Possible worlds">possible worlds</a>, as in the work of <a href="/wiki/David_Kellogg_Lewis" class="mw-redirect" title="David Kellogg Lewis">Lewis</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Experimental_philosophy" title="Experimental philosophy">experimental philosophy</a> movement sought to reappraise philosophical problems through social science research techniques.</p><p>In continental Europe, no school dominated. Fleeing fascism and communism, the logical positivists left central Europe, diminishing philosophical interest in natural science. Instead an emphasis on the humanities, broadly construed, figured prominently in <a href="/wiki/Continental_philosophy" title="Continental philosophy">continental philosophy</a>. 20th-century movements such as <a href="/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy)" title="Phenomenology (philosophy)">phenomenology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Existentialism" title="Existentialism">existentialism</a>, modern <a href="/wiki/Hermeneutics" title="Hermeneutics">hermeneutics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Critical_theory" title="Critical theory">critical theory</a>, <a href="/wiki/Structuralism" title="Structuralism">structuralism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Poststructuralism" class="mw-redirect" title="Poststructuralism">poststructuralism</a> are included within this loose category.

Western philosophy arose contemporaneously with science, mathematics, mythology, art, religion and political society.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Western_philosophy" title="Western philosophy">Western philosophy</a> is conventionally divided into four eras &#x2013; Ancient, Medieval, Modern and Contemporary. The Ancient era runs through the fall of Rome. The Medieval period runs until roughly the late 15th century and the <a href="/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>. The &quot;Modern&quot; period then began and continued to the end of the 19th century, when contemporary philosophy began.</p><p>Western Philosophy began in the Greek cities of western Asia Minor (Ionia) with <a href="/wiki/Thales" title="Thales">Thales</a> of <a href="/wiki/Miletus" title="Miletus">Miletus</a>, who was active around 585 B.C. and crafted the opaque dictum, &quot;all is water.&quot; His most noted students were respectively <a href="/wiki/Anaximander" title="Anaximander">Anaximander</a> (all is <a href="/wiki/Apeiron_(cosmology)" title="Apeiron (cosmology)">apeiron</a> (roughly, <i>the unlimited</i>)) and <a href="/wiki/Anaximenes_of_Miletus" title="Anaximenes of Miletus">Anaximenes of Miletus</a> (&quot;all is air&quot;).</p><p><a href="/wiki/Pythagoras" title="Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a>, from the island of Samos off the coast of Ionia, later lived at Croton in southern Italy (Magna Graecia). <a href="/wiki/Pythagoreanism" title="Pythagoreanism">Pythagoreans</a> hold that &quot;all is number,&quot; giving <i>formal</i> accounts in contrast to the previous <i>material</i> of the Ionians. They also believe in <a href="/wiki/Metempsychosis" title="Metempsychosis">metempsychosis</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Metempsychosis" title="Metempsychosis">transmigration of souls</a> (<a href="/wiki/Reincarnation" title="Reincarnation">reincarnation</a>).</p><p>The first true philosophic dialectic occurs between the &quot;<a href="/wiki/Becoming_(philosophy)" title="Becoming (philosophy)">becoming</a>&quot; of <a href="/wiki/Heraclitus" title="Heraclitus">Heraclitus</a> of <a href="/wiki/Ephesus" title="Ephesus">Ephesus</a> (&quot;all is fire&quot;, &quot;everything flows,&quot; all is chaotic and transitory&quot;) and the &quot;<a href="/wiki/Being" title="Being">being</a>&quot; of <a href="/wiki/Parmenides" title="Parmenides">Parmenides</a> of <a href="/wiki/Eleatic_School" class="mw-redirect" title="Eleatic School">Elea</a> (all is One, change is impossible). His student <a href="/wiki/Zeno_of_Elea" title="Zeno of Elea">Zeno</a> argued against motion with <a href="/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes" title="Zeno&apos;s paradoxes">his famous paradoxes</a>.

He introduced the concept of <i><a href="/wiki/Nous" title="Nous">Nous</a></i> (Mind) as an ordering force, which moved and separated out the original mixture, which was <a href="/wiki/Homogeneous" class="mw-redirect" title="Homogeneous">homogeneous</a>, or nearly so.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Empedocles" title="Empedocles">Empedocles</a> proposed powers called Love and Hate that would act as forces to bring about the mixture and separation of the elements, more discrete than in the mixture of Anaxagoras. Empedocles is best known as the originator of the <a href="/wiki/Cosmogony" title="Cosmogony">cosmogenic</a> theory of the four <a href="/wiki/Classical_elements" class="mw-redirect" title="Classical elements">classical elements</a>, earth, air, wind and fire. Empedocles is the last Greek philosopher to record his ideas in verse. More of his work survives than of any other Presocratic philosopher.</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Sophistry" class="mw-redirect" title="Sophistry">Sophists</a> became known for claiming that truth was no more than opinion and for teaching people to argue fallaciously to prove whatever conclusions they wished. Most famous them of was <a href="/wiki/Protagoras" title="Protagoras">Protagoras</a> who stated, &quot;man is the measure of all things&quot;.</p><p>Another school was the <a href="/wiki/Atomism" title="Atomism">atomists</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Leucippus" title="Leucippus">Leucippus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Democritus" title="Democritus">Democritus</a>, wherein the world is a composite of innumerable interacting parts.</p><p>Philosophical inquiry gradually became more concentrated in <a href="/wiki/History_of_Athens" title="History of Athens">Athens</a>, which had become the dominant city-state in <a href="/wiki/Greece" title="Greece">Greece</a>. Orators influenced Athenian history (possibly even causing its <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Lade" title="Battle of Lade">failure</a>). The city used slave labor to farm and perform other tasks, freeing the citizens to engage in inquiry and other pastimes. Skillful oratory was necessary to influence the democratic Athenian Assembly and thereby gain respect and wealth. Many sophists maintained schools of debate, with paying students, leading to increasingly refined methods of debate.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Socrates" title="Socrates">Socrates</a> was the key figure in transforming Greek philosophy into a unified and continuous project. He studied under the Sophists. Following a visit to the <a href="/wiki/Oracle_of_Delphi" class="mw-redirect" title="Oracle of Delphi">Oracle of Delphi</a> he began questioning anyone in Athens who would engage him, attempting to disprove the oracular prophecy that no man would be wiser than Socrates. Through these live dialogues, he examined common concepts that lacked clear or concrete definitions, such as beauty, truth and the virtues of piety, wisdom, temperance, courage and justice. Socrates&apos; awareness of his own ignorance allowed him to discover errors in his own thinking as well as in others. He wrote nothing, but inspired many disciples, including many sons of prominent Athenian citizens (including <a href="/wiki/Plato" title="Plato">Plato</a>). His influence led to his <a href="/wiki/Socrates#Trial_and_death" title="Socrates">trial and execution</a> in 399 B.C. on the charge that his philosophy and sophistry were undermining the youth, <a href="/wiki/Piety" title="Piety">piety</a> and moral fiber of the city. He was offered a chance to flee from his fate but chose to remain in Athens, abide by his principles and drink a poisonous tea made of <a href="/wiki/Conium" title="Conium">hemlock</a>.</p><p>Socrates&apos; most important student was Plato, who founded the <a href="/wiki/Academy" title="Academy">Academy</a> of Athens and wrote a number of dialogues that applied the <a href="/wiki/Socratic_method" title="Socratic method">Socratic method</a> of inquiry to examine philosophical problems. In the later dialogues Socrates figures less prominently, although Plato had already begun putting his own thoughts into Socrates&apos; mouth.</p><p>His <a href="/wiki/The_Forms" class="mw-redirect" title="The Forms">theory of forms</a> holds that the mind is imbued with an innate capacity to understand and contemplate concepts from a higher-order preeminent world. These concepts are more real, permanent and universal than the things we observe directly, which are changing and temporal.</p><p>He argued that the immortal soul is superior to the body; that <a href="/wiki/Evil" class="mw-redirect" title="Evil">evil</a> was simple ignorance of truth; that true knowledge leads to true virtue; that art, including music, should be subordinate to moral purpose.</p><p>He argued that the society of the <a href="/wiki/City-state" title="City-state">city-state</a> should be governed by a meritorious class of property-less <a href="/wiki/Philosopher_king" title="Philosopher king">philosopher kings</a>. These philosopher kings would have no permanent wives or paternity rights over their children and be protected by an athletically gifted, honorable, duty-bound military class. In his most famous work, <i><a href="/wiki/Plato%27s_Republic" class="mw-redirect" title="Plato&apos;s Republic">The Republic</a></i>, Plato critiques democracy, condemns tyranny and proposes a three-tiered merit-based structure of society, with workers, guardians and philosophers in an equal relationship. There no innocents would ever be put to death, citing the philosophers&apos; relentless love of truth and knowledge of the forms or ideals, concern for general welfare and lack of propertied interest as causes for their suitability as governors.</p><p>Plato&apos;s outstanding student was <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, perhaps the first systematic philosopher. <a href="/wiki/Aristotelian_logic" class="mw-redirect" title="Aristotelian logic">Aristotelian logic</a> was the first type of <a href="/wiki/Logic" title="Logic">logic</a> to attempt to categorize every valid <a href="/wiki/Syllogism" title="Syllogism">syllogism</a>. A syllogism is a form of argument that is guaranteed to be accepted, because it is known (by all educated persons) to be <a href="/wiki/Validity" title="Validity">valid</a>. A crucial assumption in <a href="/wiki/Aristotelian_logic" class="mw-redirect" title="Aristotelian logic">Aristotelian logic</a> is that its subjects are real objects. Two of Aristotle&apos;s syllogisms are invalid to modern eyes. For example, &quot;All A are B. All A are C. Therefore, some B are C.&quot; This syllogism fails if set A is empty, but there are real members of set B. In Aristotle&apos;s syllogistic logic you could say this, because his logic applied only to things that exist (&quot;no empty classes&quot;).</p><p>The application of Aristotelian logic is preceded by having the student memorize syllogisms. Each syllogism had a name, for example: <i><a href="/wiki/Modus_ponens" title="Modus ponens">modus ponens</a></i> had the form of &quot;If A is true, then B is true. A is true, therefore B is true.&quot; Memorization proceeded from diagrams, or learning a key sentence, with the first letter of each word reminding the student of the names of the syllogisms. Most university students of logic memorized Aristotle&apos;s 19 syllogisms that concerned two subjects, permitting them to validly connect a subject and object. A few logicians developed systems with three subjects, or described a way of elaborating the rules of three subjects.</p><p>Other pupils of Socrates aside from Plato founded schools, such as <a href="/wiki/Euclid_of_Megara" title="Euclid of Megara">Euclid of Megara</a>. The Hellenistic period included the <a href="/wiki/Cyrenaics" title="Cyrenaics">Cyrenaics</a> of <a href="/wiki/Aristippus" title="Aristippus">Aristippus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cynicism_(philosophy)" title="Cynicism (philosophy)">Cynics</a> of <a href="/wiki/Antisthenes" title="Antisthenes">Antisthenes</a> resolving themselves in the <a href="/wiki/Epicurean" class="mw-redirect" title="Epicurean">Epicurean</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stoicism" title="Stoicism">Stoic</a> schools. Skepticism also originated in this period.</p><p>The history of western medieval philosophy is generally divided into the early medieval period (mid-4th to 13th centuries) and the high medieval period. The early period started with <a href="/wiki/St._Augustine" class="mw-redirect" title="St. Augustine">St. Augustine</a>. The latter period began when a great bulk of <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>&apos;s works that had been lost in the West were discovered and translated into Latin from Arabic and Greek. It lasted one century and a half compared to the nine centuries of the early period. It ended around the time of <a href="/wiki/William_of_Ockham" title="William of Ockham">William of Ockham</a> in the middle of the 14th century.</p><p>Medieval philosophy was primarily concerned with reconciling the Christian faith with philosophical reason, thereby &quot;baptizing&quot; it. Early medieval philosophy was influenced by <a href="/wiki/Stoicism" title="Stoicism">Stoicism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Neo-Platonism" class="mw-redirect" title="Neo-Platonism">neo-Platonism</a>, but, above all, <a href="/wiki/Plato" title="Plato">Plato</a>nic reasoning.</p><p>The dominant figure of this period was St. Augustine, who adopted and Christianized Plato&apos;s thought. His influence was diminished with the rediscovery of Aristotle&apos;s texts. Augustinianism was the preferred starting point for most philosophers (including <a href="/wiki/St._Anselm_of_Canterbury" class="mw-redirect" title="St. Anselm of Canterbury">St. Anselm of Canterbury</a>) until that discovery. Towards the end of the early period and throughout the high period, the <a href="/wiki/Nature_of_God" class="mw-redirect" title="Nature of God">nature of God</a> and the application of <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>&apos;s concept of <a href="/wiki/Term_logic" title="Term logic">logic</a> and thought to every area of life were prime concerns. Attempts were made to reconcile them by means of <a href="/wiki/Scholasticism" title="Scholasticism">scholasticism</a>. One continuing interest was to prove the <a href="/wiki/Existence_of_God" title="Existence of God">existence of God</a>, through logic alone, if possible. The point of this exercise was not to justify belief in God, deemed self-evident, but to elevate classical philosophy, with its <a href="/wiki/Pagan" class="mw-redirect" title="Pagan">pagan</a> origins, to a respectable position in a Christian context.</p><p>One monumental effort to overcome mere logical argument was to follow Aristotelian demonstration by starting from effects and reasoning up to their causes. This took the form of the <a href="/wiki/Cosmological_argument" title="Cosmological argument">cosmological argument</a>, conventionally attributed to <a href="/wiki/St._Thomas_Aquinas" class="mw-redirect" title="St. Thomas Aquinas">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>. The argument roughly is that every phenomenon has a cause and that each cause in turn must be caused by something else. But since the chain of causes cannot stretch infinitely into the past, there must have been an uncaused &quot;first cause&quot; that was posited to be God. Aquinas adapted this argument to prove the goodness of God. Everything has some goodness and each cause is better than the thing it causes. Therefore, the first cause is the best possible thing. Similar arguments were used to prove God&apos;s power and uniqueness.</p><p>Another important argument for the existence of God was the <a href="/wiki/Ontological_argument" title="Ontological argument">ontological argument</a>, advanced by <a href="/wiki/St._Anselm" class="mw-redirect" title="St. Anselm">St. Anselm</a>. Basically, it claimed that God is that than which nothing greater can be thought. Nothing that exists only in the mind can be said to be greater than something that exists outside the mind. Hence the greatest thing that the mind can conceive of must exist in reality. Therefore, God exists. This argument was used in different forms by philosophers from Descartes forward. Other important thinkers from the medieval period include <a href="/wiki/Blessed_John_Duns_Scotus" class="mw-redirect" title="Blessed John Duns Scotus">Scotus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Anicius_Manlius_Severinus_Bo%C3%ABthius" class="mw-redirect" title="Anicius Manlius Severinus Bo&#xEB;thius">Bo&#xEB;thius</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Ab%C3%A9lard" class="mw-redirect" title="Pierre Ab&#xE9;lard">Ab&#xE9;lard</a>.</p><p>In medieval times, any research other than <a href="/wiki/Theology" title="Theology">theology</a> or <a href="/wiki/Medicine" title="Medicine">medicine</a> was called &quot;philosophy&quot;, hence the <a href="/wiki/Philosophical_Transactions_of_the_Royal_Society" title="Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</a> is a scientific journal dating from 1665, the <a href="/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy" title="Doctor of Philosophy">Doctor of Philosophy</a> (Ph.D.) degree covers a wide range of subjects from the <a href="/wiki/Humanities" title="Humanities">humanities</a> to the sciences and the <a href="/wiki/Cambridge_Philosophical_Society" title="Cambridge Philosophical Society">Cambridge Philosophical Society</a>, which is actually concerned with what would now be called <a href="/wiki/Science" title="Science">science</a> and not modern philosophy.</p><p>Contemporary philosophical <a href="/wiki/Historiography" title="Historiography">historiography</a> emphasizes a gap between Medieval and modern thought. This &quot;gap&quot; defines the &quot;modern&quot; in &quot;modern philosophy&quot;. In Western history, if Columbus&apos; 1492 voyages symbolically ended the Middle Ages. This boundary does not fit the evolution of philosophy well. Between High Scholasticism (13th and part of the 14th centuries) and the empiricist-rationalist disputes characterizing modern philosophy (17th century onward) transitional systems emerged. One focus was on emancipating the humanities, including aesthetics, <a href="/wiki/Rhetoric" title="Rhetoric">rhetoric</a> and the beginning of natural observations from <a href="/wiki/Theology" title="Theology">theology</a>. Philosophy had its own rebirth during the <a href="/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>.</p><p>Two circumstancial events helped liberate philosophy: the <a href="/wiki/Protestant_Reformation" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> and the adoption of vernacular languages instead of Latin in treatises and public discussions.</p><p>Most medieval philosophers were priests and monks, while Renaissance philosophers were more heterogeneous, including rhetoricians, magicians and astrologues, early empirical scientists, poets and philologists. One common theme among Renaissance thinkers was a concern for humanity (and the humanities) and the search for human uniqueness. The study of <i>humanae litterae</i> (human writings) overcame that of <i>divinae litterae</i> (divine writings) and opened the way for modern skepticism and science.</p><p>Renaissance philosophers diversified the approaches and topics of their predecessors. Those oriented towards empiricism and rationalism, such as <a href="/wiki/Galileo_Galilei" title="Galileo Galilei">Galileo</a> and <a href="/wiki/Machiavelli" class="mw-redirect" title="Machiavelli">Machiavelli</a>, qualify as modern philosophers. By contrast, those influenced by esoteric traditions (<a href="/wiki/Giovanni_Pico_della_Mirandola" title="Giovanni Pico della Mirandola">Mirandola</a>, <a href="/wiki/Marsilio_Ficino" title="Marsilio Ficino">Ficino</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_of_Cusa" title="Nicholas of Cusa">Nicholas of Cusa</a> and <a href="/wiki/Giordano_Bruno" title="Giordano Bruno">Bruno</a>) are better described as Medieval philosophers. Thinkers who do not clearly fall into either category and epitomize Renaissance philosophy, including <a href="/wiki/Montaigne" class="mw-redirect" title="Montaigne">Montaigne</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tommaso_Campanella" title="Tommaso Campanella">Campanella</a>, <a href="/wiki/Telesius" class="mw-redirect" title="Telesius">Telesius</a>, <a href="/wiki/Erasmus" class="mw-redirect" title="Erasmus">Erasmus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_More" title="Thomas More">More</a>.</p><p>The term &quot;modern philosophy&quot; has many definitions. One common usage is to date modern philosophy to the &quot;<a href="/wiki/Age_of_Reason" class="mw-redirect" title="Age of Reason">Age of Reason</a>&quot;, where systematic philosophy became common, marking <a href="/wiki/Hobbes" class="mw-redirect" title="Hobbes">Hobbes</a> (writing in the 17th century) as the first modern philosopher. The grounding of philosophy in problems of knowledge, rather than problems of metaphysics, dominates the era, exemplified by <a href="/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes" title="Ren&#xE9; Descartes">Descartes</a>.</p><p>Another definition starts from the Renaissance.

One dispute is over whether philosophical problems arise through misuse of language/misunderstandings of its logic or through philosophical problems. <a href="/wiki/Michael_Dummett" title="Michael Dummett">Dummett</a> makes the case that <a href="/wiki/Gottlob_Frege" title="Gottlob Frege">Frege</a>&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Foundations_of_Arithmetic" title="The Foundations of Arithmetic">The Foundations of Arithmetic</a></i> is the first analytic work, on the grounds that Frege took the &quot;linguistic turn&quot;, analyzing philosophical problems through language. <a href="/wiki/Bertrand_Russell" title="Bertrand Russell">Russell</a> and <a href="/wiki/G.E._Moore" class="mw-redirect" title="G.E. Moore">Moore</a> are often counted as founders of analytic philosophy, based on their rejection of British idealism, their defense of <a href="/wiki/Philosophical_realism" title="Philosophical realism">realism</a> and the emphasis they laid on the legitimacy of analysis.</p><p>Russell&apos;s classic works <i><a href="/wiki/The_Principles_of_Mathematics" title="The Principles of Mathematics">The Principles of Mathematics</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/On_Denoting" title="On Denoting">On Denoting</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Principia_Mathematica" title="Principia Mathematica">Principia Mathematica</a></i> with <a href="/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead" title="Alfred North Whitehead">Whitehead</a>, promoted the use of mathematical logic in philosophy. They set the research program in the early stages of the analytic tradition. They emphasized problems such as the reference of proper names, whether &apos;existence&apos; is a property, the nature of propositions, the analysis of definite descriptions, the discussions on the foundations of mathematics; and explored issues of ontological commitment and metaphysical problems regarding time, the nature of matter, mind and persistence and change. Russell and Moore&apos;s philosophy developed as a critique of <a href="/wiki/Hegel" class="mw-redirect" title="Hegel">Hegel</a> and his British followers in particular and of grand systems of <a href="/wiki/Speculative_philosophy" class="mw-redirect" title="Speculative philosophy">speculative philosophy</a> in general. <a href="/wiki/Charles_Taylor_(philosopher)" title="Charles Taylor (philosopher)">Taylor</a> is one analytic philosopher who rejects neither Hegel nor speculative philosophy. <a href="/wiki/Logical_positivism" title="Logical positivism">Logical positivism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ordinary_language_philosophy" title="Ordinary language philosophy">ordinary language</a> were both influenced by Russell and Wittgenstein&apos;s development of <a href="/wiki/Logical_Atomism" class="mw-redirect" title="Logical Atomism">logical atomism</a>, the former positively and the latter negatively.</p><p>In 1921, Wittgenstein published his <i><a href="/wiki/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus" title="Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus">Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</a></i>, which gave a rigidly &quot;logical&quot; account of linguistic and philosophical issues. At the time, he found most of the problems of philosophy to be mere puzzles of language, which could be solved by investigating and then observing language&apos;s logical structure. Later, he reversed some positions he set out in <i>Tractatus</i>, for example in his second major work, <i><a href="/wiki/Philosophical_Investigations" title="Philosophical Investigations">Philosophical Investigations</a></i> (1953). <i>Investigations</i> was influential in the development of &quot;ordinary language philosophy,&quot; which was promoted by <a href="/wiki/Gilbert_Ryle" title="Gilbert Ryle">Ryle</a>, <a href="/wiki/J.L._Austin" class="mw-redirect" title="J.L. Austin">Austin</a> and others.</p><p>Quine had a major influence in the US, with <i><a href="/wiki/Two_Dogmas_of_Empiricism" title="Two Dogmas of Empiricism">Two Dogmas of Empiricism</a></i>. Quine criticized the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements, arguing that a clear conception of &quot;analyticity&quot; was unattainable. He argued for <a href="/wiki/Holism" title="Holism">holism</a>, the thesis that language, including scientific language, is a set of interconnected sentences, none of which can be verified on its own. Instead he argued that sentences depend on each other for their meaning and truth conditions. A consequence of this approach is that language as a whole has only a thin relation to experience. Some sentences that refer directly to experience might be modified by sense impressions, but as language is theoretical, for the whole language to be modified, more than this is required. However, most of the linguistic structure can in principle be revised, even logic, in order to better model the world. Notable students of Quine include <a href="/wiki/Donald_Davidson_(philosopher)" title="Donald Davidson (philosopher)">Davidson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Dennett" title="Daniel Dennett">Dennett</a>. The former devised a program for giving a semantics to <a href="/wiki/Natural_language" title="Natural language">natural language</a> and thereby answer the philosophical conundrum &quot;what is meaning?&quot;. A crucial part of the program was the use of <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Tarski" title="Alfred Tarski">Tarski</a>&apos;s semantic theory of truth. <a href="/wiki/Michael_Dummett" title="Michael Dummett">Dummett</a>, among others, argued that truth conditions should be dispensed with in the theory of meaning and replaced by &quot;assertability conditions&quot;. Some propositions, on this view, are neither true nor false and thus such a theory of meaning entails a rejection of the <a href="/wiki/Law_of_the_excluded_middle" class="mw-redirect" title="Law of the excluded middle">law of the excluded middle</a>. This, for Dummett, entails antirealism, as Russell himself pointed out in <i>An Inquiry into Meaning and Truth</i>.</p><p>By the 1970s renewed interest in many traditional philosophical problems was evident in the younger of analytic philosophers. <a href="/wiki/David_Kellogg_Lewis" class="mw-redirect" title="David Kellogg Lewis">Lewis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Saul_Kripke" title="Saul Kripke">Kripke</a>, <a href="/wiki/Derek_Parfit" title="Derek Parfit">Parfit</a> studied traditional metaphysical problems, which they began exploring with logic and the philosophy of language. Among those problems were: free will, <a href="/wiki/Essentialism" title="Essentialism">essentialism</a>, the nature of personal identity, identity over time, the mind, causal laws, space-time, the properties of material beings and <a href="/wiki/Modality" class="mw-disambig" title="Modality">modality</a>. Analytic philosophers continued to consider these questions in the 2010s. They are also interested in the methodology of analytic philosophy. <a href="/wiki/Timothy_Williamson" title="Timothy Williamson">Williamson</a> wrote <i>The Philosophy of Philosophy</i> on that topic. Influential figures include <a href="/wiki/David_Kellogg_Lewis" class="mw-redirect" title="David Kellogg Lewis">Lewis</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_Searle" title="John Searle">Searle</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Nagel" title="Thomas Nagel">Nagel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hilary_Putnam" title="Hilary Putnam">Putnam</a>, Dummett, <a href="/wiki/Peter_van_Inwagen" title="Peter van Inwagen">Inwagen</a>, Kripke and <a href="/wiki/Patricia_Churchland" title="Patricia Churchland">Patricia Churchland</a>. Analytic philosophy has been accused of not contributing to the political debate or to traditional questions in aesthetics. However, with the appearance of <a href="/wiki/John_Rawls" title="John Rawls">Rawls</a>&apos; <i><a href="/wiki/A_Theory_of_Justice" title="A Theory of Justice">A Theory of Justice</a></i> and <a href="/wiki/Robert_Nozick" title="Robert Nozick">Nozick</a>&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/Anarchy,_State,_and_Utopia" title="Anarchy, State, and Utopia">Anarchy, State and Utopia</a></i>, analytic political philosophy gained respect.

Frege helped <a href="/wiki/George_Boole" title="George Boole">Boole</a> and others overturn Aristotle&apos;s logic, which had held sway for millennia. He developed <a href="/wiki/Predicate_logic" title="Predicate logic">predicate logic</a>, which allowed a much greater range of sentences to be parsed into logical form than was possible using the ancient Aristotelian logic.</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Logicist" class="mw-redirect" title="Logicist">logicist</a> project to ground mathematics in logic dominated the era, although it received a serious setback from <a href="/wiki/Russell%27s_Paradox" class="mw-redirect" title="Russell&apos;s Paradox">Russell&apos;s Paradox</a> and was defeated utterly by <a href="/wiki/Godel" class="mw-redirect" title="Godel">Godel</a>&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Godel%27s_Incompleteness_Theorem" class="mw-redirect" title="Godel&apos;s Incompleteness Theorem">Incompleteness Theorem</a>. During his early career, he was much influenced by Like Frege. Russell along with collaborator <a href="/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead" title="Alfred North Whitehead">Whitehead</a>, attempted to show that mathematics is reducible to logical fundamentals in <i>The Principles of Mathematics</i> (1903). Later, his book, also written with Whitehead, <i><a href="/wiki/Principia_Mathematica" title="Principia Mathematica">Principia Mathematica</a></i> (1910&#x2013;13), encouraged many philosophers to renew their interest in the development of <a href="/wiki/Mathematical_logic" title="Mathematical logic">symbolic logic</a>. Additionally, Russell adopted Frege&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Predicate_logic" title="Predicate logic">predicate logic</a> as his primary philosophical method, thinking that could expose the underlying structure of philosophical problems, most famously in his analysis of <a href="/wiki/Definite_description" title="Definite description">definite descriptions</a> in &quot;On Denoting&quot;.</p><p>An important aspect of British idealism was <a href="/wiki/Logical_holism" title="Logical holism">logical holism</a>&#x2014;the opinion that the aspects of the world cannot be known wholly without also knowing the whole world. Inspired by developments of modern logic, Russell&apos;s early work claimed that the problems of philosophy could be solved by showing the simple constituents of complex notions. This is closely related to the opinion that <a href="/wiki/Property_(philosophy)#Relations" title="Property (philosophy)">relations</a> between items are actually <i>internal relations</i>, that is, <a href="/wiki/Property_(philosophy)" title="Property (philosophy)">properties</a> internal to the nature of those items. Russell, along with Wittgenstein, in response promulgated <a href="/wiki/Logical_atomism" title="Logical atomism">logical atomism</a> and the doctrine of <i>external relations</i>&#x2014; the belief that the world consists of <i>independent</i> facts.</p><p>A basic principle of analytic philosophy is conceptual clarity, in the name of which Moore and Russell rejected <a href="/wiki/Hegelianism" title="Hegelianism">Hegelianism</a>, which they accused of obscurity.</p><p>In Husserl&apos;s 1891 book <i>Philosophie der Arithmetik</i>, he adduced &quot;<a href="/wiki/Psychologism" title="Psychologism">psychologism</a>&quot; in an attempt to show that the concept of the <a href="/wiki/Cardinal_number" title="Cardinal number">cardinal number</a> derived from psychical acts of grouping objects and counting them. Instead, Frege sought to show that mathematics and logic have their own validity, independent of the judgments or mental states of individual mathematicians and logicians. Frege further developed his philosophy of logic and mathematics in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Foundations_of_Arithmetic" title="The Foundations of Arithmetic">The Foundations of Arithmetic</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Basic_Laws_of_Arithmetic" class="mw-redirect" title="The Basic Laws of Arithmetic">The Basic Laws of Arithmetic</a></i> where he provided an alternative to psychological accounts of the concept of a number. Husserl later gave his own devastating critiques of psychologism.</p><p>Late 19th-century English philosophy was dominated by <a href="/wiki/British_idealism" title="British idealism">British idealism</a>.</p><p>Wittgenstein saw all philosophical problems as language problems. Early Wittgenstein and the <a href="/wiki/Logical_positivists" class="mw-redirect" title="Logical positivists">logical positivists</a> saw language as reducible to logical terms, perhaps exemplified in Russell&apos;s theory of definite descriptions. Wittgenstein shifted later, presenting language as a social phenomenon, not reducible to logical terms. Quine and others rejected the logical positivists. This was supported by the theory of <a href="/wiki/Implicature" title="Implicature">implicature</a> and in <a href="/wiki/J._L._Austin" title="J. L. Austin">Austin</a>&apos;s theory of <a href="/wiki/Performative_utterance" title="Performative utterance">performative utterance</a>.</p><p>Frege denied that terms have meaning in virtue of the objects to which they refer. Much of Kripke&apos;s fame comes from disputing Frege on this point. Kripke made influential contributions to logic, especially <a href="/wiki/Modal_logic" title="Modal logic">modal logic</a>. His work has profoundly influenced the analytic tradition. His principal contribution was a semantics for modal logic, involving <a href="/wiki/Possible_world" title="Possible world">possible worlds</a> as described in <a href="/wiki/Kripke_semantics" title="Kripke semantics">Kripke semantics</a>. Notable Quine student <a href="/wiki/David_Lewis_(philosopher)" title="David Lewis (philosopher)">Lewis</a> is probably best known for his controversial <a href="/wiki/Modal_realism" title="Modal realism">modal realist</a> stance that all possible worlds exist; with our world as but one among them. That is, when you say &quot;It is possible you could jump over the moon&quot; an actual world exists wherein that could happen.</p><p>Continental philosophy comprises 19th- and 20th-century philosophical traditions developed in mainland Europe.

Kant&apos;s intention was consider what we know and identify what must be true about it, as a logical consequence of the <i>way</i> we know it. One major theme was that fundamental features of reality evade direct knowledge because of limits to human faculties. Kant held that objective knowledge of the world required the mind to impose a <a href="/wiki/Conceptual_framework" title="Conceptual framework">conceptual</a> or <a href="/wiki/Categorical_framework" class="mw-redirect" title="Categorical framework">categorical framework</a> on sensory data&#x2014;a framework including space and time. He maintained that <i>things-in-themselves</i> exist independently of perceptions and judgments. Thereafter, <a href="/wiki/Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte" title="Johann Gottlieb Fichte">Fichte</a> and <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Joseph_von_Schelling" class="mw-redirect" title="Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling">Schelling</a> dispensed with belief in the independent existence of the world and created a thoroughgoing idealist philosophy.</p><p>The most notable work of this tradition was <a href="/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel" title="Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel">Hegel</a>&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/Phenomenology_of_Spirit" class="mw-redirect" title="Phenomenology of Spirit">Phenomenology of Spirit</a></i>, of 1807. Hegel admitted his ideas were not new. He claimed that previous philosophies were incomplete and attempted to complete them. Hegel asserted that the twin aims of philosophy are to account for contradictions apparent in human experience (such as the supposed contradiction between &quot;being&quot; and &quot;not being&quot;) and to resolve them by showing their compatibility at a higher level of examination (&quot;being&quot; and &quot;not being&quot; are resolved with &quot;becoming&quot;). This program of acceptance and reconciliation of contradictions became known as the &quot;Hegelian <a href="/wiki/Dialectic" title="Dialectic">dialectic</a>&quot;.</p><p>Philosophers influenced by Hegel include <a href="/wiki/Ludwig_Andreas_Feuerbach" class="mw-redirect" title="Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach">Feuerbach</a> (who coined the term &quot;projection&quot; to describe our inability to recognize external objects without envisioning qualities of ourselves in them), <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Marx</a>, <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Engels" title="Friedrich Engels">Engels</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/British_idealism" title="British idealism">British idealists</a>, notably <a href="/wiki/T._H._Green" class="mw-redirect" title="T. H. Green">Green</a>, <a href="/wiki/J._M._E._McTaggart" title="J. M. E. McTaggart">McTaggart</a> and <a href="/wiki/F._H._Bradley" title="F. H. Bradley">Bradley</a>. Unlike idealism, Hegelian dialectic and Kant&apos;s &quot;Copernican Turn&quot; remain important philosophical concepts.</p><p>Husserl&apos;s phenomenology was an attempt to give an account of the structure of conscious experience. He attempted to show that all conscious acts are directed at or about objective content, a feature that Husserl called <i><a href="/wiki/Intentionality" title="Intentionality">intentionality</a></i>. In the first part of his two-volume work, <i><a href="/wiki/Logical_Investigations_(Husserl)" title="Logical Investigations (Husserl)">Logical Investigations</a></i> (1901), he launched an extended attack on <a href="/wiki/Psychologism" title="Psychologism">psychologism</a>. In the second part, he developed <i>descriptive phenomenology</i>, attempting to show how objective judgments are grounded in conscious experience. He was not speaking of the first-person experiences of particular individuals, but in the properties essential to any such experience. He also attempted to identify the essential properties of any act of meaning. He developed the method further in <i>Ideas</i> (1913) as transcendental phenomenology, proposing to ground experience and thus human knowledge, in the structure of consciousness of an ideal, or <a href="/wiki/Transcendence_(philosophy)" title="Transcendence (philosophy)">transcendental</a>, ego. Later, he attempted to reconcile his transcendental standpoint with an acknowledgement of the intersubjective <a href="/wiki/Life-world" class="mw-redirect" title="Life-world">life-world</a> in which real subjects interact. Husserl published only a few works, which treated phenomenology mainly in abstract methodological terms; but he left many unpublished concrete analyses. Husserl&apos;s work was immediately influential in Germany, with the creation of phenomenological schools in Munich and G&#xF6;ttingen. Phenomenology later achieved international fame through the work of such philosophers as Heidegger (formerly Husserl&apos;s research assistant), <a href="/wiki/Maurice_Merleau-Ponty" title="Maurice Merleau-Ponty">Merleau-Ponty</a> and Sartre. Via Heidegger and Sartre, Husserl&apos;s focus on subjective experience influenced existentialism.</p><p>Existentialism is the belief that philosophical thinking begins with the subject&#x2014;not merely the thinking subject, but the acting, feeling, living individual. In existentialism, the individual&apos;s starting point is called &quot;the existential attitude&quot;, or a sense of disorientation and confusion in the face of an apparently meaningless/absurd world. Many existentialists regarded traditional philosophy, in both style and content, as too abstract and remote from concrete experience.</p><p>Although they did not use the term, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche are widely regarded as the fathers of existentialism. The main target of Kierkegaard&apos;s writings was Hegel&apos;s idealist philosophical system that he thought ignored or excluded the inner subjective life of living human beings. Kierkegaard conversely held that &quot;truth is subjectivity&quot;, arguing that what is most important to a subject deal with the subject&apos;s inner relationship to existence. Kierkegaard, a Christian, believed that the truth of religious faith was a subjective question to be wrestled with passionately.</p><p>Although Kierkegaard and Nietzsche were among his influences, the extent to which Heidegger can be considered an existentialist is debatable. In <i><a href="/wiki/Being_and_Time" title="Being and Time">Being and Time</a></i> he presented a method of rooting philosophical explanations in human existence (<i>Dasein</i>) to be analysed in terms of existential categories (<i>existentiale</i>). This led many commentators to treat him as an existentialist. However, in <i>The Letter on Humanism</i>, Heidegger explicitly rejected Sartre&apos;s existentialism. Sartre became the tradition&apos;s best-known proponent, exploring it in theoretical works such as <i><a href="/wiki/Being_and_Nothingness" title="Being and Nothingness">Being and Nothingness</a></i>, and in plays and novels. Sartre, along with <a href="/wiki/Simone_de_Beauvoir" title="Simone de Beauvoir">de Beauvoir</a>, represented an atheistic branch of existentialism, now more closely associated with their ideas of <a href="/wiki/Nausea_(novel)" title="Nausea (novel)">nausea</a>, contingency, <a href="/wiki/Bad_faith#Ethics.2C_phenomenology.2C_existentialism" title="Bad faith">bad faith</a> and the absurd than with spiritual angst. The individual&apos;s responsibility for the authenticity of his or her existence is common to all these thinkers.</p><p>Inaugurated by linguist <a href="/wiki/Ferdinand_de_Saussure" title="Ferdinand de Saussure">Saussure</a>, structuralism sought to clarify systems of signs through analyzing the <a href="/wiki/Discourse" title="Discourse">discourses</a> they define. Saussure conceived of the sign as delimited by the other signs in the system and that ideas could not exist prior to linguistic structure, which articulates thought. This led continental thought toward the &quot;decentering&quot; of the speaker: language is no not spoken to express a true inner self: instead language &quot;speaks&quot; the speaker. Structuralism sought the imprimatur of a hard science, but its <a href="/wiki/Positivism" title="Positivism">positivism</a> soon came under fire by poststructuralists, some of whom were former structuralists.</p><p>Structuralists believed they could analyze systems from an external, objective standing, but the poststructuralists argued that structures cannot transcend and thus analysis is determined by the object of analysis. While the distinction between the signifier and signified was treated as unambiguous by structuralists, poststructuralists asserted that every attempt to comprehend the signified results only in more signifiers, ever deferring meaning, ultimately defeating interpretation. Structuralism dominated continental philosophy throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, encompassing <a href="/wiki/Claude_L%C3%A9vi-Strauss" title="Claude L&#xE9;vi-Strauss">L&#xE9;vi-Strauss</a>, <a href="/wiki/Roland_Barthes" title="Roland Barthes">Barthes</a> and Lacan. Post-structuralism dominated from the 1970s onwards, including thinkers such as Foucault, Derrida, <a href="/wiki/Gilles_Deleuze" title="Gilles Deleuze">Deleuze</a> and even Barthes.</p><p>Pragmatism asserts that the truth of beliefs consists in their usefulness and efficacy rather than their correspondence with reality. <a href="/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce" title="Charles Sanders Peirce">Peirce</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_James" title="William James">James</a> were its co-founders and it was later modified by <a href="/wiki/John_Dewey" title="John Dewey">Dewey</a> as <a href="/wiki/Instrumentalism" title="Instrumentalism">instrumentalism</a>. Since the usefulness of any belief at any time might be contingent on circumstance, Peirce and James conceptualised final truth as something established only by the future, final settlement of all opinion.</p><p>Pragmatism attempted to find a scientific concept of truth that does not depend on personal insight (revelation) or reference to some metaphysical realm. It interpreted the meaning of a statement by the effect its acceptance would have on practice. Inquiry taken far enough is thus the only path to truth.</p><p>For <a href="/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce" title="Charles Sanders Peirce">Peirce</a> commitment to inquiry was essential to truth-finding, implied by the idea and hope that inquiry is not fruitless. The interpretation of these principles has been subject to discussion ever since. Peirce&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Pragmatic_maxim" title="Pragmatic maxim">maxim of pragmatism</a> is, &quot;Consider what effects, which might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object.&quot;</p><p>Critics accused pragmatism falling victim to a simple fallacy: that because something that is true proves useful, that usefulness is an appropriate basis for its truthfulness. Pragmatist thinkers include Dewey, <a href="/wiki/George_Santayana" title="George Santayana">Santayana</a>, Quine and <a href="/wiki/C._I._Lewis" class="mw-redirect" title="C. I. Lewis">Lewis</a>. Pragmatism was later worked on by Rorty, Lachs, <a href="/wiki/Donald_Davidson_(philosopher)" title="Donald Davidson (philosopher)">Davidson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Susan_Haack" title="Susan Haack">Haack</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hilary_Putnam" title="Hilary Putnam">Putnam</a>.</p><p>Instrumentalism is named for its premise that theories are tools or instruments identifying reliable means-end relations found in experience, but not claiming to reveal realities beyond experience. Its premises and practices were most clearly and persuasively stated by <a href="/wiki/John_Dewey" title="John Dewey">Dewey</a> and <a href="/wiki/Karl_Popper" title="Karl Popper">Popper</a>. Independently, they defined the school quite similarly, but their judgments of its premises were irreconcilable.</p><p>A variety of other academic and non-academic approaches have been explored.</p><p>Largely Aristotelian in its approach and content, <a href="/wiki/Thomism" title="Thomism">Thomism</a> is a philosophical tradition that follows the writings of Thomas Aquinas. His work has been read, studied and disputed since the 13th century, especially by Roman Catholics. Aquinas enjoyed a revived interest beginning in the late 19th century, among both atheists (<a href="/wiki/Philippa_Foot" title="Philippa Foot">Philippa Foot</a>) and theists (<a href="/wiki/G._E._M._Anscombe" class="mw-redirect" title="G. E. M. Anscombe">Elizabeth Anscombe</a>). Thomist philosophers tend to be <a href="/wiki/Rationalism" title="Rationalism">rationalists</a> in epistemology, as well as metaphysical <a href="/wiki/Philosophical_realism" title="Philosophical realism">realists</a> and <a href="/wiki/Virtue_ethics" title="Virtue ethics">virtue ethicists</a>. The claim that humans are rational animals whose good can be known by reason that can be achieved by the will. Thomists (e.g., Aristotle) argue that soul or psyche is real and immaterial but inseparable from matter in organisms. Soul is the form of the body. Thomists accept Aristotle&apos;s causes as natural, including teleological or final causes. In this way, although Aquinas argued that whatever is in the intellect begins in the senses, natural teleology can be discerned with the senses and abstracted from nature through induction.</p><p>Contemporary Thomism encompasses multiple variants, from <a href="/wiki/Neo-Scholasticism" title="Neo-Scholasticism">Neo-Scholasticism</a> to Existential Thomism.</p><p>The so-called new <a href="/wiki/Natural_Law" class="mw-redirect" title="Natural Law">natural lawyers</a> like <a href="/wiki/Germain_Grisez" title="Germain Grisez">Grisez</a> and <a href="/wiki/Robert_P._George" title="Robert P.

However, most students of academic philosophy later contribute to law, journalism, religion, sciences, politics, business, or various arts.
