With fellow member <a href="/wiki/Paul_McCartney" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>, he formed a celebrated <a href="/wiki/Lennon%E2%80%93McCartney" title="Lennon&#x2013;McCartney">songwriting partnership</a>.</p><p>Born and raised in <a href="/wiki/Liverpool" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, Lennon became involved in the <a href="/wiki/Skiffle#Skiffle_in_Britain" title="Skiffle">skiffle craze</a> as a teenager; his first band, <a href="/wiki/The_Quarrymen" title="The Quarrymen">the Quarrymen</a>, evolved into the Beatles in 1960. When <a href="/wiki/Break-up_of_the_Beatles" title="Break-up of the Beatles">the group disbanded</a> in 1970, Lennon embarked on a solo career that produced the critically acclaimed albums <i><a href="/wiki/John_Lennon/Plastic_Ono_Band" title="John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band">John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Imagine_(album)" class="mw-redirect" title="Imagine (album)">Imagine</a></i>, and iconic songs such as &quot;<a href="/wiki/Give_Peace_a_Chance" title="Give Peace a Chance">Give Peace a Chance</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="/wiki/Working_Class_Hero" title="Working Class Hero">Working Class Hero</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a href="/wiki/Imagine_(John_Lennon_song)" title="Imagine (John Lennon song)">Imagine</a>&quot;. After his marriage to <a href="/wiki/Yoko_Ono" title="Yoko Ono">Yoko Ono</a> in 1969, he changed his name to John Ono Lennon. Lennon disengaged himself from the music business in 1975 to raise his infant son <a href="/wiki/Sean_Lennon" title="Sean Lennon">Sean</a>, but re-emerged with Ono in 1980 with the new album <i><a href="/wiki/Double_Fantasy" title="Double Fantasy">Double Fantasy</a></i>. He was <a href="/wiki/Death_of_John_Lennon" title="Death of John Lennon">murdered</a> three weeks after its release.</p><p>Lennon revealed a rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. Controversial through his political and <a href="/wiki/Peace_activist" class="mw-redirect" title="Peace activist">peace activism</a>, he moved to <a href="/wiki/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> in 1971, where his criticism of the <a href="/wiki/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> resulted in a lengthy attempt by <a href="/wiki/Richard_Nixon" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>&apos;s administration to deport him, while some of his songs were adopted as anthems by the <a href="/wiki/Anti-war_movement" title="Anti-war movement">anti-war movement</a> and the larger <a href="/wiki/Counterculture_of_the_1960s" title="Counterculture of the 1960s">counterculture</a>.</p><p>As of 2012, Lennon&apos;s solo album sales in the United States exceeded 14 million and, as writer, co-writer, or performer, he is responsible for 25 number-one singles on the US <a href="/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100" title="Billboard Hot 100">Hot 100</a> chart. In 2002, a BBC poll on the <a href="/wiki/100_Greatest_Britons" title="100 Greatest Britons">100 Greatest Britons</a> voted him eighth and, in 2008, <i><a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a></i> ranked him the fifth-greatest singer of all time. He was posthumously inducted into the <a href="/wiki/Songwriters_Hall_of_Fame" title="Songwriters Hall of Fame">Songwriters Hall of Fame</a> in 1987, and into the <a href="/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame" title="Rock and Roll Hall of Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> twice, as a member of the Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1994.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Lennon was born in war-time England, on 9 October 1940 at Liverpool Maternity Hospital, to <a href="/wiki/Julia_Lennon" title="Julia Lennon">Julia</a> (n&#xE9;e Stanley) and <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Lennon" title="Alfred Lennon">Alfred Lennon</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Merchant_Navy" class="mw-redirect" title="Merchant Navy">merchant seaman</a> of Irish descent, who was away at the time of his son&apos;s birth. His parents named him John Winston Lennon after his paternal grandfather, John &quot;Jack&quot; Lennon, and then-Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Winston_Churchill" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>. His father was often away from home but sent regular pay cheques to 9<span class="nowrap">&#xA0;</span>Newcastle Road, Liverpool, where Lennon lived with his mother; the cheques stopped when he went <a href="/wiki/AWOL" class="mw-redirect" title="AWOL">absent without leave</a> in February 1944. When he eventually came home six months later, he offered to look after the family, but Julia&#x2014;by then pregnant with another man&apos;s child&#x2014;rejected the idea. After her sister, <a href="/wiki/Mimi_Smith" title="Mimi Smith">Mimi Smith</a>, twice complained to Liverpool&apos;s Social Services, Julia handed the care of Lennon over to her. In July 1946 Lennon&apos;s father visited Smith and took his son to Blackpool, secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him. Julia followed them&#x2014;with her partner at the time, &apos;Bobby&apos; Dykins&#x2014;and after a heated argument his father forced the five-year-old to choose between them. Lennon twice chose his father, but as his mother walked away, he began to cry and followed her. It would be 20 years before he had contact with his father again.</p><p>Throughout the rest of his childhood and adolescence he lived with his aunt and uncle, Mimi and <a href="/wiki/George_Toogood_Smith" title="George Toogood Smith">George Smith</a>, who had no children of their own, at <a href="/wiki/251_Menlove_Avenue" title="251 Menlove Avenue">Mendips, 251<span class="nowrap">&#xA0;</span>Menlove Avenue</a>, <a href="/wiki/Woolton" title="Woolton">Woolton</a>. His aunt purchased volumes of short stories for him, and his uncle, a dairyman at his family&apos;s farm, bought him a mouth organ and engaged him in solving <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/crossword" class="extiw" title="wikt:crossword">crossword</a> puzzles. Julia visited Mendips on a regular basis, and when John was 11 years old he often visited her at 1&#xA0;Blomfield Road, Liverpool, where she played him <a href="/wiki/Elvis_Presley" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a> records, taught him the banjo, and showed him how to play &quot;<a href="/wiki/Ain%27t_That_a_Shame" title="Ain&apos;t That a Shame">Ain&apos;t That a Shame</a>&quot; by <a href="/wiki/Fats_Domino" title="Fats Domino">Fats Domino</a>. In September 1980, Lennon commented about his family and his rebellious nature:</p><p>Part of me would like to be accepted by all facets of society and <i>not</i> be this loudmouthed lunatic poet/musician. But I cannot be what I am not&#xA0;... I was the one who all the other boys&apos; parents&#x2014;including Paul&apos;s father&#x2014;would say, &apos;Keep away from him&apos;...&#xA0;The parents instinctively recognised I was a troublemaker, meaning I did not conform and I would influence their children, which I did. I did my best to disrupt every friend&apos;s home&#xA0;... Partly out of envy that I didn&apos;t have this so-called home&#xA0;... but I <i>did</i>...&#xA0;There were five women that were my family. Five <i>strong</i>, <i>intelligent</i>, <i>beautiful</i> women, five sisters. One happened to be my mother. [She] just couldn&apos;t deal with life. She was the youngest and she had a husband who ran away to sea and the war was on and she couldn&apos;t cope with me, and I ended up living with her elder sister. Now those women were fantastic&#xA0;... And that was my first feminist education&#xA0;... I would infiltrate the other boys minds. I could say, &quot;Parents are not gods because I don&apos;t live with mine and, therefore, I know.&apos;</p><p>He regularly visited his cousin, Stanley Parkes, who lived in <a href="/wiki/Fleetwood" title="Fleetwood">Fleetwood</a>. Seven years Lennon&apos;s senior, Parkes took him on trips and to local cinemas. During the school holidays, Parkes often visited Lennon with Leila Harvey, another cousin, often travelling to Blackpool two or three times a week to watch shows. They would visit the <a href="/wiki/Blackpool_Tower_Circus" class="mw-redirect" title="Blackpool Tower Circus">Blackpool Tower Circus</a> and see artists such as <a href="/wiki/Dickie_Valentine" title="Dickie Valentine">Dickie Valentine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Askey" title="Arthur Askey">Arthur Askey</a>, <a href="/wiki/Max_Bygraves" title="Max Bygraves">Max Bygraves</a> and <a href="/wiki/Joe_Loss" title="Joe Loss">Joe Loss</a>, with Parkes recalling that Lennon particularly liked <a href="/wiki/George_Formby,_Jr." class="mw-redirect" title="George Formby, Jr.">George Formby</a>. After Parkes&apos;s family moved to Scotland, the three cousins often spent their school holidays together there. Parkes recalled, &quot;John, cousin Leila and I were very close. From Edinburgh we would drive up to the family croft at <a href="/wiki/Durness" title="Durness">Durness</a>, which was from about the time John was nine years old until he was about 16.&quot; He was 14 years old when his uncle George died of a liver haemorrhage on 5 June 1955 (aged 52).</p><p>Lennon was raised as an <a href="/wiki/Anglican" class="mw-redirect" title="Anglican">Anglican</a> and attended <a href="/wiki/Dovedale_Primary_School" title="Dovedale Primary School">Dovedale Primary School</a>. From September 1952 to 1957, after passing his <a href="/wiki/Eleven-Plus" class="mw-redirect" title="Eleven-Plus">Eleven-Plus</a> exam, he attended <a href="/wiki/Quarry_Bank_High_School" class="mw-redirect" title="Quarry Bank High School">Quarry Bank High School</a> in Liverpool, and was described by Harvey at the time as, &quot;A happy-go-lucky, good-humoured, easy going, lively lad.&quot; He often drew comical cartoons which appeared in his own self-made school magazine called <i>The Daily Howl</i>, but despite his artistic talent, his school reports were damning: &quot;Certainly on the road to failure&#xA0;... hopeless&#xA0;... rather a clown in class&#xA0;... wasting other pupils&apos; time.&quot;</p><p>His mother bought him his first guitar in 1956, an inexpensive <a href="/wiki/Gallotone_Champion" class="mw-redirect" title="Gallotone Champion">Gallotone Champion</a> acoustic for which she &quot;lent&quot; her son five pounds and ten shillings on the condition that the guitar be delivered to her own house, and not Mimi&apos;s, knowing well that her sister was not supportive of her son&apos;s musical aspirations. As Mimi was sceptical of his claim that he would be famous one day, she hoped he would grow bored with music, often telling him, &quot;The guitar&apos;s all very well, John, but you&apos;ll never make a living out of it&quot;. On 15 July 1958, when Lennon was 17 years old, his mother, walking home after visiting the Smiths&apos; house, was struck by a car and killed.</p><p>Lennon failed all his <a href="/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Education" title="General Certificate of Education">GCE</a> O-level examinations, and was accepted into the <a href="/wiki/Liverpool_College_of_Art" title="Liverpool College of Art">Liverpool College of Art</a> only after his aunt and headmaster intervened. Once at the college, he started wearing <a href="/wiki/Teddy_Boy" title="Teddy Boy">Teddy Boy</a> clothes and acquired a reputation for disrupting classes and ridiculing teachers. As a result, he was excluded from the painting class, then the graphic arts course, and was threatened with expulsion for his behaviour, which included sitting on a nude model&apos;s lap during a <a href="/wiki/Figure_drawing" title="Figure drawing">life drawing</a> class. He failed an annual exam, despite help from fellow student and future wife <a href="/wiki/Cynthia_Powell" class="mw-redirect" title="Cynthia Powell">Cynthia Powell</a>, and was &quot;thrown out of the college before his final year&quot;.</p><p>At age 15, Lennon formed the <a href="/wiki/Skiffle_group" class="mw-redirect" title="Skiffle group">skiffle group</a>, the Quarrymen. Named after Quarry Bank High School, the group was established by him in September 1956. By the summer of 1957, the Quarrymen played a &quot;spirited set of songs&quot; made up of half skiffle and half <a href="/wiki/Rock_and_roll" title="Rock and roll">rock and roll</a>. Lennon first met Paul McCartney at the Quarrymen&apos;s second performance, held in Woolton on 6 July at the St. Peter&apos;s Church garden f&#xEA;te, after which he asked McCartney to join the band.</p><p>McCartney says that Aunt Mimi &quot;was very aware that John&apos;s friends were lower class&quot;, and would often patronise him when he arrived to visit Lennon. According to Paul&apos;s brother Mike, McCartney&apos;s father was also disapproving, declaring Lennon would get his son &quot;into trouble&quot;, although he later allowed the fledgling band to rehearse in the McCartneys&apos; front room at <a href="/wiki/20_Forthlin_Road" title="20 Forthlin Road">20<span class="nowrap">&#xA0;</span>Forthlin Road</a>. During this time, the 18-year-old Lennon wrote his first song, &quot;<a href="/wiki/Hello_Little_Girl" title="Hello Little Girl">Hello Little Girl</a>&quot;, a UK top 10 hit for <a href="/wiki/The_Fourmost" title="The Fourmost">The Fourmost</a> nearly five years later.</p><p>McCartney suggested his friend <a href="/wiki/George_Harrison" title="George Harrison">George Harrison</a> as the lead guitarist. Lennon thought Harrison (then 14 years old) was too young. McCartney engineered an audition on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, where Harrison played &quot;<a href="/wiki/Raunchy_(instrumental)" title="Raunchy (instrumental)">Raunchy</a>&quot; for Lennon and was asked to join. <a href="/wiki/Stuart_Sutcliffe" title="Stuart Sutcliffe">Stuart Sutcliffe</a>, Lennon&apos;s friend from art school, later joined as bassist. Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Sutcliffe became &quot;The Beatles&quot; in early 1960. In August that year, the Beatles engaged for a 48-night <a href="/wiki/The_Beatles_in_Hamburg" title="The Beatles in Hamburg">residency in Hamburg</a>, Germany, and desperately in need of a drummer, asked <a href="/wiki/Pete_Best" title="Pete Best">Pete Best</a> to join them. Lennon was now 19, and his aunt, horrified when he told her about the trip, pleaded with him to continue his art studies instead. After the first Hamburg residency, the band accepted another in April 1961, and a third in April 1962. Like the other band members, Lennon was introduced to <a href="/wiki/Preludin" class="mw-redirect" title="Preludin">Preludin</a> while in Hamburg, and regularly took the drug, as well as <a href="/wiki/Amphetamines" class="mw-redirect" title="Amphetamines">amphetamines</a>, as a stimulant during their long, overnight performances.</p><p><a href="/wiki/Brian_Epstein" title="Brian Epstein">Brian Epstein</a>, the Beatles&apos; manager from 1962, had no prior experience of artist management, but had a strong influence on their early dress code and attitude on stage. Lennon initially resisted his attempts to encourage the band to present a professional appearance, but eventually complied, saying, &quot;I&apos;ll wear a bloody balloon if somebody&apos;s going to pay me&quot;. McCartney took over on bass after Sutcliffe decided to stay in Hamburg, and drummer <a href="/wiki/Ringo_Starr" title="Ringo Starr">Ringo Starr</a> replaced Best, completing the four-piece line-up that would endure until the group&apos;s break-up in 1970. The band&apos;s first single, &quot;<a href="/wiki/Love_Me_Do" title="Love Me Do">Love Me Do</a>&quot;, was released in October 1962 and reached No. 17 on the British charts. They recorded their debut album, <i><a href="/wiki/Please_Please_Me" title="Please Please Me">Please Please Me</a></i>, in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963, a day when Lennon was suffering the effects of a cold, which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded that day, &quot;<a href="/wiki/Twist_and_Shout" title="Twist and Shout">Twist and Shout</a>&quot;. The Lennon&#x2013;McCartney songwriting partnership yielded eight of its fourteen tracks. With few exceptions&#x2014;one being the album title itself&#x2014;Lennon had yet to bring his love of wordplay to bear on his song lyrics, saying: &quot;We were just writing songs<span class="nowrap">&#xA0;</span>... pop songs with no more thought of them than that&#x2014;to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant&quot;. In a 1987 interview, McCartney said that the other Beatles idolised John: &quot;He was like our own little Elvis<span class="nowrap">&#xA0;</span>... We all looked up to John. He was older and he was very much the leader; he was the quickest wit and the smartest.&quot;</p><p>The Beatles achieved mainstream success in the UK during the beginning of 1963. Lennon was on tour when his first son, <a href="/wiki/Julian_Lennon" title="Julian Lennon">Julian</a>, was born in April. During their <a href="/wiki/Royal_Variety_Show" class="mw-redirect" title="Royal Variety Show">Royal Variety Show</a> performance, attended by the Queen Mother and other British royalty, Lennon poked fun at his audience: &quot;For our next song, I&apos;d like to ask for your help. For the people in the cheaper seats, clap your hands<span class="nowrap">&#xA0;</span>... and the rest of you, if you&apos;ll just rattle your jewellery.&quot; After a year of <a href="/wiki/Beatlemania_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="Beatlemania in the United Kingdom">Beatlemania in the UK</a>, the group&apos;s historic February 1964 US debut appearance on <i><a href="/wiki/The_Ed_Sullivan_Show" title="The Ed Sullivan Show">The Ed Sullivan Show</a></i> marked their breakthrough to international stardom. A two-year period of constant touring, moviemaking, and songwriting followed, during which Lennon wrote two books, <i><a href="/wiki/In_His_Own_Write" title="In His Own Write">In His Own Write</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/A_Spaniard_in_the_Works" title="A Spaniard in the Works">A Spaniard in the Works</a></i>. The Beatles received recognition from the British Establishment when they were appointed <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="Order of the British Empire">Members of the Order of the British Empire</a> (MBE) in the <a href="/wiki/1965_Birthday_Honours" title="1965 Birthday Honours">1965 Queen&apos;s Birthday Honours</a>.</p><p>Lennon grew concerned that fans attending Beatles concerts were unable to hear the music above the screaming of fans, and that the band&apos;s musicianship was beginning to suffer as a result. Lennon&apos;s &quot;<a href="/wiki/Help!_(song)" title="Help! (song)">Help!</a>&quot; expressed his own feelings in 1965: &quot;I <i>meant</i> it<span class="nowrap">&#xA0;</span>... It was me singing &apos;help&apos;&quot;. He had put on weight (he would later refer to this as his &quot;Fat Elvis&quot; period), and felt he was subconsciously seeking change. In March that year he was unknowingly introduced to <a href="/wiki/LSD" class="mw-redirect" title="LSD">LSD</a> when a dentist, hosting a dinner party attended by Lennon, Harrison and their wives, spiked the guests&apos; coffee with the drug. When they wanted to leave, their host revealed what they had taken, and strongly advised them not to leave the house because of the likely effects. Later, in an elevator at a nightclub, they all believed it was on fire: &quot;We were all screaming<span class="nowrap">&#xA0;</span>... hot and hysterical.&quot; <span id="BiggerThanJesus"></span> In March 1966, during an interview with <i>Evening Standard</i> reporter <a href="/wiki/Maureen_Cleave" title="Maureen Cleave">Maureen Cleave</a>, Lennon remarked, &quot;Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink<span class="nowrap">&#xA0;</span>... We&apos;re more popular than Jesus now&#x2014;I don&apos;t know which will go first, rock and roll or Christianity.&quot; The comment went virtually unnoticed in England but caused <a href="/wiki/More_popular_than_Jesus" title="More popular than Jesus">great offence in the US</a> when quoted by a magazine there five months later. The furore that followed&#x2014;burning of Beatles records, <a href="/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> activity and threats against Lennon&#x2014;contributed to the band&apos;s decision to stop touring.</p><p>Deprived of the routine of live performances after their final commercial concert on 29 August 1966, Lennon felt lost and considered leaving the band. Since his involuntary introduction to LSD, he had made increasing use of the drug, and was almost constantly under its influence for much of 1967. According to biographer Ian MacDonald, Lennon&apos;s continuous experience with LSD during the year brought him &quot;close to <a href="/wiki/Egolessness" class="mw-redirect" title="Egolessness">erasing his identity</a>&quot;. 1967 saw the release of &quot;<a href="/wiki/Strawberry_Fields_Forever" title="Strawberry Fields Forever">Strawberry Fields Forever</a>&quot;, hailed by <i>Time</i> magazine for its &quot;astonishing inventiveness&quot;, and the group&apos;s landmark album <i><a href="/wiki/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band" title="Sgt. Pepper&apos;s Lonely Hearts Club Band">Sgt. Pepper&apos;s Lonely Hearts Club Band</a></i>, which revealed Lennon&apos;s lyrics contrasting strongly with the simple love songs of the Lennon&#x2013;McCartney&apos;s early years.</p><p>In August, after having been introduced to the <a href="/wiki/Maharishi_Mahesh_Yogi" title="Maharishi Mahesh Yogi">Maharishi Mahesh Yogi</a>, the group attended a weekend of personal instruction at his <a href="/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation" title="Transcendental Meditation">Transcendental Meditation</a> seminar in Bangor, Wales, and were informed of Epstein&apos;s death during the seminar. &quot;I knew we were in trouble then&quot;, Lennon said later. &quot;I didn&apos;t have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music, and I was scared&quot;. Led primarily by Harrison and Lennon&apos;s interest in Eastern religion, the Beatles later travelled to Maharishi&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Ashram" title="Ashram">ashram</a> in India for further guidance. While there, they composed most of the songs for <i><a href="/wiki/The_Beatles_(album)" title="The Beatles (album)">The Beatles</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Abbey_Road" title="Abbey Road">Abbey Road</a></i>.</p><p>The anti-war, black comedy <i><a href="/wiki/How_I_Won_the_War" title="How I Won the War">How I Won the War</a></i>, featuring Lennon&apos;s only appearance in a non&#x2013;Beatles full-length film, was shown in cinemas in October 1967. McCartney organised the group&apos;s first post-Epstein project, the self-written, -produced and -directed television film <i><a href="/wiki/Magical_Mystery_Tour_(film)" title="Magical Mystery Tour (film)">Magical Mystery Tour</a></i>, released in December that year. While the film itself proved to be their first critical flop, its <a href="/wiki/Magical_Mystery_Tour" title="Magical Mystery Tour">soundtrack release</a>, featuring Lennon&apos;s acclaimed, <a href="/wiki/Lewis_Carroll" title="Lewis Carroll">Lewis Carroll</a>-inspired &quot;<a href="/wiki/I_Am_the_Walrus" title="I Am the Walrus">I Am the Walrus</a>&quot;, was a success. With Epstein gone, the band members became increasingly involved in business activities, and in February 1968 they formed <a href="/wiki/Apple_Corps" title="Apple Corps">Apple Corps</a>, a multimedia corporation composed of <a href="/wiki/Apple_Records" title="Apple Records">Apple Records</a> and several other subsidiary companies. Lennon described the venture as an attempt to achieve, &quot;artistic freedom within a business structure&quot;, but his increased drug experimentation and growing preoccupation with <a href="/wiki/Yoko_Ono" title="Yoko Ono">Yoko Ono</a>, and McCartney&apos;s own marriage plans, left Apple in need of professional management. Lennon asked <a href="/wiki/Lord_Beeching" class="mw-redirect" title="Lord Beeching">Lord Beeching</a> to take on the role, but he declined, advising Lennon to go back to making records. Lennon approached <a href="/wiki/Allen_Klein" title="Allen Klein">Allen Klein</a>, who had managed <a href="/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones" title="The Rolling Stones">The Rolling Stones</a> and other bands during the <a href="/wiki/British_Invasion" title="British Invasion">British Invasion</a>. Klein was appointed as Apple&apos;s chief executive by Lennon, Harrison and Starr, but McCartney never signed the management contract.</p><p>At the end of 1968, Lennon was featured in the film <i><a href="/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones_Rock_and_Roll_Circus" title="The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus">The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus</a></i> (not released until 1996) in the role of a <a href="/wiki/The_Dirty_Mac" title="The Dirty Mac">Dirty Mac</a> band member.

Lennon and Ono were married on 20 March 1969, and soon released a series of 14 <a href="/wiki/Lithograph" class="mw-redirect" title="Lithograph">lithographs</a> called &quot;Bag One&quot; depicting scenes from their honeymoon, eight of which were deemed indecent and most of which were banned and confiscated. Lennon&apos;s creative focus continued to move beyond the Beatles and between 1968 and 1969 he and Ono recorded three albums of experimental music together: <i><a href="/wiki/Unfinished_Music_No.1:_Two_Virgins" class="mw-redirect" title="Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins">Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins</a></i> (known more for its cover than for its music), <i><a href="/wiki/Unfinished_Music_No.2:_Life_with_the_Lions" class="mw-redirect" title="Unfinished Music No.2: Life with the Lions">Unfinished Music No.2: Life with the Lions</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Wedding_Album" title="Wedding Album">Wedding Album</a></i>. In 1969, they formed the <a href="/wiki/Plastic_Ono_Band" title="Plastic Ono Band">Plastic Ono Band</a>, releasing <i><a href="/wiki/Live_Peace_in_Toronto_1969" title="Live Peace in Toronto 1969">Live Peace in Toronto 1969</a></i>. Between 1969 and 1970, Lennon released the singles &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; (widely adopted as an anti-Vietnam-War anthem in 1969), &quot;<a href="/wiki/Cold_Turkey" title="Cold Turkey">Cold Turkey</a>&quot; (documenting his withdrawal symptoms after he became addicted to heroin) and &quot;<a href="/wiki/Instant_Karma!" title="Instant Karma!">Instant Karma!</a>&quot; In protest at Britain&apos;s involvement in the <a href="/wiki/Nigerian_Civil_War" title="Nigerian Civil War">Nigerian Civil War</a>, its support of America in the <a href="/wiki/Vietnam_war" class="mw-redirect" title="Vietnam war">Vietnam war</a> and (perhaps jokingly) against &quot;Cold Turkey&quot; slipping down the charts, Lennon returned his <a href="/wiki/MBE" class="mw-redirect" title="MBE">MBE</a> medal to the Queen, though this had no effect on his MBE status, which could not be renounced.</p><p>Lennon left the Beatles in September 1969, and agreed not to inform the media while the group renegotiated their recording contract, but he was outraged that McCartney publicised his own departure on releasing <a href="/wiki/McCartney_(album)" title="McCartney (album)">his debut solo album</a> in April 1970. Lennon&apos;s reaction was, &quot;Jesus Christ! He gets all the credit for it!&quot; He later wrote, &quot;I started the band. I disbanded it. It&apos;s as simple as that.&quot; In later interviews with <i><a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a></i> magazine, he revealed his bitterness towards McCartney, saying, &quot;I was a fool not to do what Paul did, which was use it to sell a record.&quot; He spoke too of the hostility he perceived the other members had towards Ono, and of how he, Harrison, and Starr &quot;got fed up with being sidemen for Paul&#xA0;... After Brian Epstein died we collapsed. Paul took over and supposedly led us. But what is leading us when we went round in circles?&quot;</p><p>In 1970, Lennon and Ono went through <a href="/wiki/Primal_therapy#John_Lennon" title="Primal therapy">primal therapy</a> with <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Janov" title="Arthur Janov">Arthur Janov</a> in Los Angeles, California. Designed to release emotional pain from early childhood, the therapy entailed two half-days a week with Janov for four months; he had wanted to treat the couple for longer, but they felt no need to continue and returned to London. Lennon&apos;s emotional debut solo album, <i><a href="/wiki/John_Lennon/Plastic_Ono_Band" title="John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band">John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band</a></i> (1970), was received with high praise. Critic <a href="/wiki/Greil_Marcus" title="Greil Marcus">Greil Marcus</a> remarked, &quot;John&apos;s singing in the last verse of &apos;God&apos; may be the finest in all of rock.&quot; The album featured the songs &quot;<a href="/wiki/Mother_(John_Lennon_song)" title="Mother (John Lennon song)">Mother</a>&quot;, in which Lennon confronted his feelings of childhood rejection, and the Dylanesque &quot;<a href="/wiki/Working_Class_Hero" title="Working Class Hero">Working Class Hero</a>&quot;, a bitter attack against the bourgeois social system which, due to the lyric &quot;you&apos;re still fucking peasants&quot;, fell foul of broadcasters. The same year, <a href="/wiki/Tariq_Ali" title="Tariq Ali">Tariq Ali</a>&apos;s revolutionary political views, expressed when he interviewed Lennon, inspired the singer to write &quot;<a href="/wiki/Power_to_the_People_(song)" title="Power to the People (song)">Power to the People</a>&quot;. Lennon also became involved with Ali during a protest against <a href="/wiki/Oz_(magazine)" title="Oz (magazine)"><i>Oz</i> magazine&apos;s</a> prosecution for alleged obscenity. Lennon denounced the proceedings as &quot;disgusting fascism&quot;, and he and Ono (as Elastic Oz Band) released the single &quot;God Save Us/Do the Oz&quot; and joined marches in support of the magazine.</p><p>With Lennon&apos;s next album, <i>Imagine</i> (1971), critical response was more guarded. <i>Rolling Stone</i> reported that &quot;it contains a substantial portion of good music&quot; but warned of the possibility that &quot;his posturings will soon seem not merely dull but irrelevant&quot;. The album&apos;s title track would become an anthem for anti-war movements, while another, &quot;<a href="/wiki/How_Do_You_Sleep%3F_(John_Lennon_song)" title="How Do You Sleep? (John Lennon song)">How Do You Sleep?</a>&quot;, was a musical attack on McCartney in response to lyrics from <i><a href="/wiki/Ram_(album)" title="Ram (album)">Ram</a></i> that Lennon felt, and McCartney later confirmed, were directed at him and Ono. However, Lennon softened his stance in the mid-1970s and said he had written &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot; about himself. He said in 1980: &quot;I used my resentment against Paul<span class="nowrap">&#xA0;</span>&#x2026; to create a song<span class="nowrap">&#xA0;</span>&#x2026; not a terrible vicious horrible vendetta<span class="nowrap">&#xA0;</span>[&#x2026;] I used my resentment and withdrawing from Paul and the Beatles, and the relationship with Paul, to write &apos;How Do You Sleep&apos;. I don&apos;t really go &apos;round with those thoughts in my head all the time.&quot;</p><p>Lennon and Ono moved to New York in August 1971, and in December released &quot;<a href="/wiki/Happy_Xmas_(War_Is_Over)" title="Happy Xmas (War Is Over)">Happy Xmas (War Is Over)</a>&quot;. The new year saw the <a href="/wiki/Presidency_of_Richard_Nixon" title="Presidency of Richard Nixon">Nixon administration</a> take what it called a &quot;strategic counter-measure&quot; against Lennon&apos;s anti-war and anti-Nixon propaganda, embarking on what would be a <a href="#Deportation_attempt">four-year attempt to deport him</a>. In 1972, Lennon and Ono attended a post-election wake held in the New York home of activist <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Rubin" title="Jerry Rubin">Jerry Rubin</a> after <a href="/wiki/George_McGovern" title="George McGovern">McGovern</a> lost to Nixon. Embroiled in a continuing legal battle with the immigration authorities, Lennon was denied <a href="/wiki/Permanent_residence_(United_States)" title="Permanent residence (United States)">permanent residency in the US</a> (which wouldn&apos;t be resolved until 1976). Depressed, Lennon got intoxicated and had sex with a female guest, leaving Ono embarrassed. Her song &quot;Death of Samantha&quot; was inspired by the incident.</p><p>Recorded as a collaboration with Ono and with backing from the New York band <a href="/wiki/Elephant%27s_Memory" title="Elephant&apos;s Memory">Elephant&apos;s Memory</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/Some_Time_in_New_York_City" title="Some Time in New York City">Some Time in New York City</a></i> was released in 1972. Containing songs about women&apos;s rights, race relations, Britain&apos;s role in Northern Ireland and Lennon&apos;s problems obtaining a green card, the album was poorly received&#x2014;unlistenable, according to one critic. &quot;<a href="/wiki/Woman_Is_the_Nigger_of_the_World" title="Woman Is the Nigger of the World">Woman Is the Nigger of the World</a>&quot;, released as a US single from the album the same year, was televised on 11 May, on <i><a href="/wiki/The_Dick_Cavett_Show" title="The Dick Cavett Show">The Dick Cavett Show</a></i>. Many radio stations refused to broadcast the song because of the word &quot;<a href="/wiki/Nigger" title="Nigger">nigger</a>&quot;. Lennon and Ono gave two benefit concerts with Elephant&apos;s Memory and guests in New York in aid of patients at the <a href="/wiki/Willowbrook_State_School" title="Willowbrook State School">Willowbrook State School</a> mental facility. Staged at <a href="/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden" title="Madison Square Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> on 30 August 1972, they were his last full-length concert appearances.</p><p>While Lennon was recording <i><a href="/wiki/Mind_Games_(John_Lennon_album)" title="Mind Games (John Lennon album)">Mind Games</a></i> (1973), he and Ono decided to separate. The ensuing 18-month period apart, which he later called his &quot;<a href="/wiki/The_Lost_Weekend_(novel)" title="The Lost Weekend (novel)">lost weekend</a>&quot;, was spent in Los Angeles and New York in the company of <a href="/wiki/May_Pang" title="May Pang">May Pang</a>. <i>Mind Games</i>, credited to the &quot;Plastic U.F.Ono Band&quot;, was released in November 1973. Lennon also contributed &quot;<a href="/wiki/I%27m_the_Greatest" title="I&apos;m the Greatest">I&apos;m the Greatest</a>&quot; to Starr&apos;s album <i><a href="/wiki/Ringo_(album)" title="Ringo (album)">Ringo</a></i> (1973), released the same month (an alternate take, from the same 1973 <i>Ringo</i> sessions, with Lennon providing a guide vocal, appears on <i><a href="/wiki/John_Lennon_Anthology" title="John Lennon Anthology">John Lennon Anthology</a></i>).</p><p>In early 1974, Lennon was drinking heavily and his alcohol-fuelled antics with <a href="/wiki/Harry_Nilsson" title="Harry Nilsson">Harry Nilsson</a> made headlines. Two widely publicised incidents occurred at <a href="/wiki/The_Troubadour_(Los_Angeles)" class="mw-redirect" title="The Troubadour (Los Angeles)">The Troubadour</a> club in March, the first when Lennon placed a <a href="/wiki/Sanitary_napkin" title="Sanitary napkin">menstrual pad</a> on his forehead and scuffled with a waitress, and the second, two weeks later, when Lennon and Nilsson were ejected from the same club after heckling the <a href="/wiki/Smothers_Brothers" title="Smothers Brothers">Smothers Brothers</a>. Lennon decided to produce Nilsson&apos;s album <i><a href="/wiki/Pussy_Cats" title="Pussy Cats">Pussy Cats</a></i> and Pang rented a Los Angeles beach house for all the musicians but after a month of further debauchery, with the recording sessions in chaos, Lennon moved to New York with Pang to finish work on the album. In April, Lennon had produced the <a href="/wiki/Mick_Jagger" title="Mick Jagger">Mick Jagger</a> song &quot;Too Many Cooks (Spoil the Soup)&quot; which was, for contractual reasons, to remain unreleased for more than 30 years. Pang supplied the recording for its eventual inclusion on <i><a href="/wiki/The_Very_Best_of_Mick_Jagger" title="The Very Best of Mick Jagger">The Very Best of Mick Jagger</a></i> (2007).</p><p>Settled back in New York, Lennon recorded the album <i><a href="/wiki/Walls_and_Bridges" title="Walls and Bridges">Walls and Bridges</a></i>. Released in October 1974, it included &quot;<a href="/wiki/Whatever_Gets_You_thru_the_Night" title="Whatever Gets You thru the Night">Whatever Gets You thru the Night</a>&quot;, which featured <a href="/wiki/Elton_John" title="Elton John">Elton John</a> on backing vocals and piano, and became Lennon&apos;s only single as a solo artist to top the US <a href="/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100" title="Billboard Hot 100"><i>Billboard</i> Hot 100</a> chart during his lifetime. A second single from the album, &quot;<a href="/wiki/Number_9_Dream" title="Number 9 Dream">#9 Dream</a>&quot;, followed before the end of the year. Starr&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/Goodnight_Vienna" title="Goodnight Vienna">Goodnight Vienna</a></i> (1974) again saw assistance from Lennon, who wrote the title track and played piano. On 28 November, Lennon made a surprise guest appearance at Elton John&apos;s Thanksgiving concert at <a href="/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden" title="Madison Square Garden">Madison Square Garden</a>, in fulfilment of his promise to join the singer in a live show if &quot;Whatever Gets You thru the Night&quot;&#x2014;a song whose commercial potential Lennon had doubted&#x2014;reached number one. Lennon performed the song along with &quot;<a href="/wiki/Lucy_in_the_Sky_with_Diamonds" title="Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds">Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="/wiki/I_Saw_Her_Standing_There" title="I Saw Her Standing There">I Saw Her Standing There</a>&quot;, which he introduced as &quot;a song by an old estranged fianc&#xE9;e of mine called Paul&quot;.</p><p>Lennon co-wrote &quot;<a href="/wiki/Fame_(David_Bowie_song)" title="Fame (David Bowie song)">Fame</a>&quot;, <a href="/wiki/David_Bowie" title="David Bowie">David Bowie</a>&apos;s first US number one, and provided guitar and backing vocals for the January 1975 recording. The same month, Elton John topped the charts with his cover of &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;, featuring Lennon on guitar and back-up vocals (Lennon is credited on the single under the moniker of &quot;Dr. Winston O&apos;Boogie&quot;). He and Ono were reunited shortly afterwards. Lennon released <i><a href="/wiki/Rock_%27n%27_Roll_(John_Lennon_album)" title="Rock &apos;n&apos; Roll (John Lennon album)">Rock &apos;n&apos; Roll</a></i> (1975), an album of cover songs, in February. &quot;<a href="/wiki/Stand_by_Me_(song)" title="Stand by Me (song)">Stand by Me</a>&quot;, taken from the album and a US and UK hit, became his last single for five years. He made what would be his final stage appearance in the <a href="/wiki/Associated_TeleVision" class="mw-redirect" title="Associated TeleVision">ATV</a> special <i>A Salute to <a href="/wiki/Lew_Grade" class="mw-redirect" title="Lew Grade">Lew Grade</a></i>, recorded on 18 April and televised in June. Playing acoustic guitar and backed by an eight-piece band, Lennon performed two songs from <i>Rock &apos;n&apos; Roll</i> (&quot;Stand by Me&quot;, which was not broadcast, and &quot;Slippin&apos; and Slidin&apos;&quot;) followed by &quot;Imagine&quot;. The band, known as Etc., wore masks behind their heads, a dig by Lennon who thought Grade was two-faced.</p><p>With the birth of his second son <a href="/wiki/Sean_Lennon" title="Sean Lennon">Sean</a> on 9 October 1975, Lennon took on the role of househusband, beginning what would be a five-year hiatus from the music industry during which he gave all his attention to his family. Within the month, he fulfilled his contractual obligation to EMI/Capitol for one more album by releasing <i><a href="/wiki/Shaved_Fish" title="Shaved Fish">Shaved Fish</a></i>, a compilation album of previously recorded tracks. He devoted himself to Sean, rising at 6<span class="nowrap">&#xA0;</span>am daily to plan and prepare his meals and to spend time with him. He wrote &quot;Cookin&apos; (In the Kitchen of Love)&quot; for Starr&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/Ringo%27s_Rotogravure" title="Ringo&apos;s Rotogravure">Ringo&apos;s Rotogravure</a></i> (1976), performing on the track in June in what would be his last recording session until 1980. He formally announced his break from music in Tokyo in 1977, saying, &quot;we have basically decided, without any great decision, to be with our baby as much as we can until we feel we can take time off to indulge ourselves in creating things outside of the family.&quot; During his career break he created several series of drawings, and drafted a book containing a mix of autobiographical material and what he termed &quot;mad stuff&quot;, all of which would be published posthumously.</p><p>Lennon emerged from retirement in October 1980 with the single &quot;<a href="/wiki/(Just_Like)_Starting_Over" title="(Just Like) Starting Over">(Just Like) Starting Over</a>&quot;, followed the next month by the album <i><a href="/wiki/Double_Fantasy" title="Double Fantasy">Double Fantasy</a></i>, which contained songs written during a journey to <a href="/wiki/Bermuda" title="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> on a 43-foot sailing boat the previous June, that reflected his fulfilment in his new-found stable family life. Sufficient additional material was recorded for a planned follow-up album <i><a href="/wiki/Milk_and_Honey_(album)" title="Milk and Honey (album)">Milk and Honey</a></i> (released posthumously in 1984). Released jointly by Lennon and Ono, <i>Double Fantasy</i> was not well received, drawing comments such as <i><a href="/wiki/Melody_Maker" title="Melody Maker">Melody Maker</a>&apos;</i>s &quot;indulgent sterility<span class="nowrap">&#xA0;</span>... a godawful yawn&quot;.</p><p>At around 10:50<span class="nowrap">&#xA0;</span>p.m. (EST) on 8 December 1980, as Lennon and Ono returned to their New York apartment in the <a href="/wiki/The_Dakota" title="The Dakota">Dakota</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mark_David_Chapman" title="Mark David Chapman">Mark David Chapman</a> shot Lennon in the back four times at the entrance to the building. Lennon was taken to the emergency room of nearby <a href="/wiki/St._Luke%27s-Roosevelt_Hospital_Center" class="mw-redirect" title="St. Luke&apos;s-Roosevelt Hospital Center">Roosevelt Hospital</a> and was pronounced dead on arrival at 11:00<span class="nowrap">&#xA0;</span>p.m. (EST). Earlier that evening, Lennon had autographed a copy of <i>Double Fantasy</i> for Chapman.</p><p>Ono issued a statement the next day, saying &quot;There is no funeral for John&quot;, ending it with the words, &quot;John loved and prayed for the human race. Please pray the same for him.&quot; His body was cremated at <a href="/wiki/Ferncliff_Cemetery" title="Ferncliff Cemetery">Ferncliff Cemetery</a> in <a href="/wiki/Hartsdale,_New_York" title="Hartsdale, New York">Hartsdale, New York</a>. Ono scattered his ashes in New York&apos;s <a href="/wiki/Central_Park" title="Central Park">Central Park</a>, where the <a href="/wiki/Strawberry_Fields_(memorial)" title="Strawberry Fields (memorial)">Strawberry Fields memorial</a> was later created. Chapman pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 20-years-to-life. As of 2016, he remains in prison, having been denied parole eight times.</p><p>Lennon and Cynthia Powell (1939&#x2013;2015) met in 1957 as fellow students at the <a href="/wiki/Liverpool_College_of_Art" title="Liverpool College of Art">Liverpool College of Art</a>. Although being scared of Lennon&apos;s attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with French actress <a href="/wiki/Brigitte_Bardot" title="Brigitte Bardot">Brigitte Bardot</a>, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, &quot;I didn&apos;t ask you to fuckin&apos; marry me, did I?&quot; She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney&apos;s girlfriend at the time to visit him. Lennon, jealous by nature, eventually grew possessive and often terrified Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude to women. The Beatles song &quot;<a href="/wiki/Getting_Better" title="Getting Better">Getting Better</a>&quot;, he said, told his own story, &quot;I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically&#x2014;any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn&apos;t express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace&quot;.</p><p>Recalling his reaction in July 1962 on learning that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, &quot;There&apos;s only one thing for it Cyn. We&apos;ll have to get married.&quot; The couple were married on 23 August at the <a href="/wiki/Mount_Pleasant,_Liverpool" title="Mount Pleasant, Liverpool">Mount Pleasant</a> <a href="/wiki/Register_Office" class="mw-redirect" title="Register Office">Register Office</a> in Liverpool. His marriage began just as <a href="/wiki/Beatlemania_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="Beatlemania in the United Kingdom">Beatlemania</a> took hold across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day, and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein, fearing that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his son until three days later.</p><p>Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to LSD, and as a result, she felt that he slowly lost interest in her. When the group travelled by train to <a href="/wiki/Bangor,_Gwynedd" title="Bangor, Gwynedd">Bangor</a>, Wales, in 1967, for the Maharishi Yogi&apos;s Transcendental Meditation seminar, a policeman did not recognise her and stopped her from boarding. She later recalled how the incident seemed to symbolise the ending of their marriage. After arriving home at <a href="/wiki/Kenwood,_St._George%27s_Hill" title="Kenwood, St. George&apos;s Hill">Kenwood</a>, and finding Lennon with Ono, Cynthia left the house to stay with friends. <a href="/wiki/Magic_Alex" title="Magic Alex">Alexis Mardas</a> later claimed to have slept with her that night, and a few weeks later he informed her that Lennon was seeking a divorce and custody of Julian on grounds of her adultery with him. After negotiations, Lennon capitulated and agreed to her divorcing him on the same grounds. The case was settled out of court in November 1968, with Lennon giving her &#xA3;100,000 ($240,000 in US dollars at the time), a small annual payment and custody of Julian.</p><p>The Beatles were performing at Liverpool&apos;s <a href="/wiki/The_Cavern_Club" title="The Cavern Club">Cavern Club</a> in November 1961, when they were introduced to Epstein after a midday concert. Epstein was homosexual. According to biographer <a href="/wiki/Philip_Norman_(author)" title="Philip Norman (author)">Philip Norman</a>, one of his reasons for wanting to manage the group was that he was physically attracted to Lennon. Almost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, leading to speculation about their relationship. Questioned about it later, Lennon said, &quot;Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We used to sit in a caf&#xE9; in <a href="/wiki/Torremolinos" title="Torremolinos">Torremolinos</a> looking at all the boys and I&apos;d say, &apos;Do you like that one? Do you like this one?&apos; I was rather enjoying the experience, thinking like a writer all the time: I am experiencing this.&quot; Soon after their return from Spain, at McCartney&apos;s twenty-first birthday party in June 1963, Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club MC <a href="/wiki/Bob_Wooler" title="Bob Wooler">Bob Wooler</a> for saying &quot;How was your honeymoon, John?&quot; The MC, known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks, was making a joke, but ten months had passed since Lennon&apos;s marriage, and the honeymoon, deferred, was still two months in the future. To Lennon, who was intoxicated with alcohol at the time, the matter was simple: &quot;He called me a <a href="/wiki/Queer" title="Queer">queer</a> so I battered his bloody ribs in&quot;.</p><p>Lennon delighted in mocking Epstein for his homosexuality and for the fact that he was Jewish. When Epstein invited suggestions for the title of his autobiography, Lennon offered <i>Queer Jew</i>; on learning of the eventual title, <i><a href="/wiki/A_Cellarful_of_Noise" title="A Cellarful of Noise">A Cellarful of Noise</a></i>, he parodied, &quot;More like <i>A Cellarful of Boys</i>&quot;. He demanded of a visitor to Epstein&apos;s flat, &quot;Have you come to blackmail him? If not, you&apos;re the only bugger in London who hasn&apos;t.&quot; During the recording of &quot;<a href="/wiki/Baby,_You%27re_a_Rich_Man" title="Baby, You&apos;re a Rich Man">Baby, You&apos;re a Rich Man</a>&quot;, he sang altered choruses of &quot;Baby, you&apos;re a rich fag Jew&quot;.</p><p>Lennon&apos;s first son, Julian, was born as his commitments with the Beatles intensified <a href="/wiki/Beatlemania_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="Beatlemania in the United Kingdom">at the height of Beatlemania</a> during his marriage to Cynthia. Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian&apos;s birth, like his mother Cynthia&apos;s marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles&apos; commercial success. Julian recalls how some four years later, as a small child in <a href="/wiki/Weybridge" title="Weybridge">Weybridge</a>, &quot;I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, &apos;What&apos;s this?&apos; I said, &apos;It&apos;s Lucy in the sky with diamonds.&apos;&quot; Lennon used it as the title of a <a href="/wiki/Lucy_in_the_Sky_with_Diamonds" title="Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds">Beatles song</a>, and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials <a href="/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide" title="Lysergic acid diethylamide">LSD</a>, Lennon insisted, &quot;It&apos;s not an acid song.&quot; McCartney corroborated Lennon&apos;s explanation that Julian innocently came up with the name. Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon&apos;s divorce, McCartney composed a song, &quot;Hey Jules&quot;, to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song &quot;<a href="/wiki/Hey_Jude" title="Hey Jude">Hey Jude</a>&quot;. Lennon later said, &quot;That&apos;s his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian<span class="nowrap">&#xA0;</span>... he turned it into &apos;Hey Jude&apos;. I always thought it was about me and Yoko but he said it wasn&apos;t.&quot;</p><p>Lennon&apos;s relationship with Julian was already strained, and after Lennon and Ono&apos;s 1971 move to New York, Julian would not see his father again until 1973. With Pang&apos;s encouragement, it was arranged for him (and his mother) to visit Lennon in Los Angeles, where they went to <a href="/wiki/Disneyland" title="Disneyland">Disneyland</a>. Julian started to see his father regularly, and Lennon gave him a drumming part on a <i><a href="/wiki/Walls_and_Bridges" title="Walls and Bridges">Walls and Bridges</a></i> track. He bought Julian a <a href="/wiki/Gibson_Les_Paul" title="Gibson Les Paul">Gibson Les Paul</a> guitar and other instruments, and encouraged his interest in music by demonstrating guitar chord techniques. Julian recalls that he and his father &quot;got on a great deal better&quot; during the time he spent in New York: &quot;We had a lot of fun, laughed a lot and had a great time in general.&quot;</p><p>In a <i>Playboy</i> interview with David Sheff shortly before his death, Lennon said, &quot;Sean was a planned child, and therein lies the difference. I don&apos;t love Julian any less as a child. He&apos;s still my son, whether he came from a bottle of whiskey or because they didn&apos;t have pills in those days. He&apos;s here, he belongs to me, and he always will.&quot; He said he was trying to re-establish a connection with the then 17-year-old, and confidently predicted, &quot;Julian and I will have a relationship in the future.&quot; After his death it was revealed that he had left Julian very little in his will.</p><p>Two versions exist of how Lennon met Ono. According to the first, told by the Lennons, on 9 November 1966 Lennon went to the <a href="/wiki/Indica_Gallery" title="Indica Gallery">Indica Gallery</a> in London, where Ono was preparing her conceptual art exhibit, and they were introduced by gallery owner <a href="/wiki/John_Dunbar_(artist)" title="John Dunbar (artist)">John Dunbar</a>. Lennon was intrigued by Ono&apos;s &quot;Hammer A Nail&quot;: patrons hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet begun, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her, &quot;Don&apos;t you know who this is? He&apos;s a millionaire! He might buy it.&quot; Ono had supposedly not heard of the Beatles, but relented on condition that Lennon pay her five <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/shilling" class="extiw" title="wikt:shilling">shillings</a>, to which Lennon replied, &quot;I&apos;ll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in.&quot; The second version, told by McCartney, is that in late 1965, Ono was in London compiling original musical scores for a book <a href="/wiki/John_Cage" title="John Cage">John Cage</a> was working on, <i><a href="/wiki/Notations" title="Notations">Notations</a></i>, but McCartney declined to give her any of his own manuscripts for the book, suggesting that Lennon might oblige. When asked, Lennon gave Ono the original handwritten lyrics to &quot;<a href="/wiki/The_Word_(song)" title="The Word (song)">The Word</a>&quot;.</p><p>Ono began visiting and telephoning Lennon&apos;s home and, when his wife asked for an explanation, Lennon explained that Ono was only trying to obtain money for her &quot;avant-garde bullshit&quot;. In May 1968, while his wife was on holiday in Greece, Lennon invited Ono to visit. They spent the night recording what would become the <i><a href="/wiki/Two_Virgins" class="mw-redirect" title="Two Virgins">Two Virgins</a></i> album, after which, he said, they &quot;made love at dawn.&quot; When Lennon&apos;s wife returned home she found Ono wearing her bathrobe and drinking tea with Lennon who simply said, &quot;Oh, hi.&quot; Ono became pregnant in 1968 and miscarried a male child they named John Ono Lennon<span class="nowrap">&#xA0;</span>II on 21 November 1968, a few weeks after Lennon&apos;s divorce from Cynthia was granted.</p><p>During Lennon&apos;s last two years in the Beatles, he and Ono began public protests against the <a href="/wiki/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>. They were married in <a href="/wiki/Gibraltar" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> on 20 March 1969, and spent their honeymoon at the <a href="/wiki/Hilton_Amsterdam" title="Hilton Amsterdam">Hilton Amsterdam</a> campaigning with a week-long <a href="/wiki/Bed-In" title="Bed-In">Bed-In for Peace</a>. They planned another Bed-In in the United States, but were denied entry, so held one instead at the <a href="/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_Hotel" title="Queen Elizabeth Hotel">Queen Elizabeth Hotel</a> in Montreal, where they recorded &quot;<a href="/wiki/Give_Peace_a_Chance" title="Give Peace a Chance">Give Peace a Chance</a>&quot;. They often combined advocacy with performance art, as in their &quot;<a href="/wiki/Bagism" title="Bagism">Bagism</a>&quot;, first introduced during a Vienna press conference. Lennon detailed this period in the Beatles song &quot;<a href="/wiki/The_Ballad_of_John_and_Yoko" title="The Ballad of John and Yoko">The Ballad of John and Yoko</a>&quot;. Lennon changed his name by <a href="/wiki/Deed_poll" title="Deed poll">deed poll</a> on 22 April 1969, adding &quot;Ono&quot; as a middle name. The brief ceremony took place on the roof of the <a href="/wiki/Apple_Corps" title="Apple Corps">Apple Corps</a> building, made famous three months earlier by the Beatles&apos; <i><a href="/wiki/Let_It_Be" title="Let It Be">Let It Be</a></i> <a href="/wiki/The_Beatles%27_rooftop_concert" title="The Beatles&apos; rooftop concert">rooftop concert</a>. Although he used the name John Ono Lennon thereafter, official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon, since he was not permitted to revoke a name given at birth.

After Ono was injured in a car accident, Lennon arranged for a king-sized bed to be brought to the recording studio as he worked on the Beatles&apos; last album, <i><a href="/wiki/Abbey_Road" title="Abbey Road">Abbey Road</a></i>. To escape the acrimony of the band&apos;s break-up, Ono suggested they move permanently to New York, which they did on 31 August 1971.</p><p>They first lived in <a href="/wiki/The_St._Regis_Hotel" class="mw-redirect" title="The St. Regis Hotel">The St. Regis Hotel</a> on 5th&#xA0;Avenue, East <a href="/wiki/55th_Street_(Manhattan)" title="55th Street (Manhattan)">55th Street</a>, then moved to a street-level flat at 105&#xA0;<a href="/wiki/Bank_Street_(Manhattan)" title="Bank Street (Manhattan)">Bank Street</a>, <a href="/wiki/Greenwich_Village" title="Greenwich Village">Greenwich Village</a>, on 16 October 1971.

Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. After she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged from one another. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, &quot;He likes you a lot.&quot; Pang, 22, astounded by Ono&apos;s proposition, eventually agreed to become Lennon&apos;s companion. The pair soon moved to California, beginning an 18-month period he later called his &quot;<a href="/wiki/May_Pang#.22Lost_Weekend.22" title="May Pang">lost weekend</a>&quot;. In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie <a href="/wiki/Mal_Evans" title="Mal Evans">Mal Evans</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Harry_Nilsson" title="Harry Nilsson">Harry Nilsson</a>. Whilst drinking with Nilsson, after misunderstanding something Pang said, Lennon attempted to strangle her, relenting only when physically restrained by Nilsson.</p><p>Upon returning to New York, they prepared a spare room in their newly rented apartment for Julian to visit. Lennon, hitherto inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he was refusing to accept Ono&apos;s telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. But after the meeting he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her Lennon was unavailable, being exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment, stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. He told her his separation from Ono was now over, though Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his <a href="/wiki/Mistress_(lover)" title="Mistress (lover)">mistress</a>.</p><p>When Lennon and Ono were reunited, she became pregnant, but having previously suffered three <a href="/wiki/Miscarriage" title="Miscarriage">miscarriages</a> in her attempt to have a child with Lennon, she said she wanted an abortion. She agreed to allow the pregnancy to continue on condition that Lennon adopt the role of <a href="/wiki/Househusband" class="mw-redirect" title="Househusband">househusband</a>; this he agreed to do. Sean was born on 9 October 1975, Lennon&apos;s 35th birthday, delivered by <a href="/wiki/Caesarean_section" title="Caesarean section">Caesarean section</a>. Lennon&apos;s subsequent career break would span five years. He had a photographer take pictures of Sean every day of his first year, and created numerous drawings for him, posthumously published as <i>Real Love: The Drawings for Sean</i>. Lennon later proudly declared, &quot;He didn&apos;t come out of my belly but, by God, I made his bones, because I&apos;ve attended to every meal, and to how he sleeps, and to the fact that he swims like a fish.&quot;</p><p>Although his friendship with Starr remained consistently friendly during the years following the Beatles&apos; break-up in 1970, Lennon&apos;s relationships with McCartney and Harrison varied. He was close to Harrison initially, but the two drifted apart after Lennon moved to America. When Harrison was in New York for his December 1974 <i><a href="/wiki/Dark_Horse_(George_Harrison_album)" title="Dark Horse (George Harrison album)">Dark Horse</a></i> tour, Lennon agreed to join him on stage, but failed to appear after an argument over Lennon&apos;s refusal to sign an agreement that would finally dissolve the Beatles&apos; legal partnership. (Lennon eventually signed the papers while holidaying in Florida with Pang and Julian.) Harrison offended Lennon in 1980, when he published an autobiography that made little mention of him. Lennon told <i><a href="/wiki/Playboy" title="Playboy">Playboy</a></i>, &quot;I was hurt by it. By glaring omission<span class="nowrap">&#xA0;</span>... my influence on his life is absolutely zilch<span class="nowrap">&#xA0;</span>... he remembers every two-bit sax player or guitarist he met in subsequent years. I&apos;m not in the book.&quot;</p><p>Lennon&apos;s most intense feelings were reserved for McCartney. In addition to attacking him through the lyrics of &quot;<a href="/wiki/How_Do_You_Sleep%3F_(John_Lennon_song)" title="How Do You Sleep? (John Lennon song)">How Do You Sleep?</a>&quot;, Lennon argued with him through the press for three years after the group split. The two later began to reestablish something of the close friendship they had once known, and in 1974, they even played music together again before eventually growing apart once more. Lennon said that during McCartney&apos;s final visit, in April 1976, they watched the episode of <i><a href="/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live" title="Saturday Night Live">Saturday Night Live</a></i> in which <a href="/wiki/Lorne_Michaels" title="Lorne Michaels">Lorne Michaels</a> made a $3,000 cash offer to get the Beatles to reunite on the show. The pair considered going to the studio to make a joke appearance, attempting to claim their share of the money, but were too tired. Lennon summarised his feelings towards McCartney in an interview three days before his death: &quot;Throughout my career, I&apos;ve selected to work with<span class="nowrap">&#xA0;</span>... only two people: Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono<span class="nowrap">&#xA0;</span>... That ain&apos;t bad picking.&quot;</p><p>Along with his estrangement from McCartney, Lennon always felt a musical competitiveness with him and kept an ear on his music. During his five-year career break he was content to sit back so long as McCartney was producing what Lennon saw as mediocre material. When McCartney released &quot;<a href="/wiki/Coming_Up_(song)" title="Coming Up (song)">Coming Up</a>&quot;, in 1980, the year Lennon returned to the studio and the last year of his life, he took notice. &quot;It&apos;s driving me crackers!&quot; he jokingly complained, because he could not get the tune out of his head. Asked the same year whether the group were dreaded enemies or the best of friends, he replied that they were neither, and that he had not seen any of them in a long time. But he also said, &quot;I still love those guys. The Beatles are over, but John, Paul, George and Ringo go on.&quot;</p><p>Lennon and Ono used their honeymoon as what they termed a &quot;<a href="/wiki/Bed-In" title="Bed-In">Bed-In for Peace</a>&quot; at the <a href="/wiki/Amsterdam_Hilton_Hotel" class="mw-redirect" title="Amsterdam Hilton Hotel">Amsterdam Hilton Hotel</a>; the March 1969 event attracted worldwide media ridicule. At a second Bed-In three months later at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal Lennon wrote and recorded &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot;. Released as a single, it was quickly taken up as an anti-war anthem and sung by a quarter of a million demonstrators against the <a href="/wiki/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> in Washington,&#xA0;DC, on 15 November, the second <a href="/wiki/Moratorium_to_End_the_War_in_Vietnam" title="Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam">Vietnam Moratorium Day</a>. In December, they paid for billboards in 10 cities around the world which declared, in the national language, &quot;War Is Over! If You Want It&quot;.</p><p>Later that year, Lennon and Ono supported efforts by the family of <a href="/wiki/James_Hanratty" title="James Hanratty">James Hanratty</a>, hanged for murder in 1962, to prove his innocence. Those who had condemned Hanratty were, according to Lennon, &quot;the same people who are running guns to South Africa and killing blacks in the streets.&#xA0;... The same bastards are in control, the same people are running everything, it&apos;s the whole bullshit bourgeois scene.&quot; In London, Lennon and Ono staged a &quot;Britain Murdered Hanratty&quot; banner march and a &quot;Silent Protest For James Hanratty&quot;, and produced a 40-minute documentary on the case. At an <a href="/wiki/Court_of_Appeal_of_England_and_Wales" title="Court of Appeal of England and Wales">appeal hearing</a> years later, Hanratty&apos;s conviction was upheld after <a href="/wiki/DNA_evidence" class="mw-redirect" title="DNA evidence">DNA evidence</a> matched. His family continued to appeal in 2010.</p><p>Lennon and Ono showed their solidarity with the <a href="/wiki/Clydeside" class="mw-redirect" title="Clydeside">Clydeside</a> <a href="/wiki/Upper_Clyde_Shipbuilders" title="Upper Clyde Shipbuilders">UCS</a> workers&apos; <a href="/wiki/Work-in" title="Work-in">work-in</a> of 1971 by sending a bouquet of red roses and a cheque for &#xA3;5,000. On moving to New York City in August that year, they befriended two of the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Seven" title="Chicago Seven">Chicago Seven</a>, <a href="/wiki/Youth_International_Party" title="Youth International Party">Yippie</a> peace activists <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Rubin" title="Jerry Rubin">Jerry Rubin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Abbie_Hoffman" title="Abbie Hoffman">Abbie Hoffman</a>. Another political activist, <a href="/wiki/John_Sinclair_(poet)" title="John Sinclair (poet)">John Sinclair</a>, poet and co-founder of the <a href="/wiki/White_Panther_Party" title="White Panther Party">White Panther Party</a>, was serving ten years in prison for selling two <a href="/wiki/Joint_(cannabis)" title="Joint (cannabis)">joints</a> of marijuana after previous convictions for possession of the drug. In December 1971 at <a href="/wiki/Ann_Arbor,_Michigan" title="Ann Arbor, Michigan">Ann Arbor, Michigan</a>, 15,000 people attended the &quot;<a href="/wiki/John_Sinclair_Freedom_Rally" title="John Sinclair Freedom Rally">John Sinclair Freedom Rally</a>&quot;, a protest and benefit concert with contributions from Lennon, <a href="/wiki/Stevie_Wonder" title="Stevie Wonder">Stevie Wonder</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bob_Seger" title="Bob Seger">Bob Seger</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bobby_Seale" title="Bobby Seale">Bobby Seale</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Black_Panther_Party" title="Black Panther Party">Black Panther Party</a>, and others. Lennon and Ono, backed by <a href="/wiki/David_Peel_(musician)" title="David Peel (musician)">David Peel</a> and Rubin, performed an acoustic set of four songs from their forthcoming <i>Some Time in New York City</i> album including &quot;John Sinclair&quot;, whose lyrics called for his release. The day before the rally, the <a href="/wiki/Michigan_Senate" title="Michigan Senate">Michigan Senate</a> passed a bill that significantly reduced the penalties for possession of marijuana and four days later Sinclair was released on an appeal bond. The performance was recorded and two of the tracks later appeared on <i><a href="/wiki/John_Lennon_Anthology" title="John Lennon Anthology">John Lennon Anthology</a></i> (1998).</p><p>Following the <i><a href="/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_(1972)" title="Bloody Sunday (1972)">Bloody Sunday</a></i> incident in <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> in 1972, in which 14 unarmed <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Civil_Rights_Association" title="Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association">civil rights protesters</a> were shot dead by the British Army, Lennon said that given the choice between the army and the <a href="/wiki/Official_Irish_Republican_Army" title="Official Irish Republican Army">IRA</a> (who were not involved in the incident) he would side with the latter. Lennon and Ono wrote two songs protesting British presence and actions in Ireland for their <i>Some Time in New York City</i> album: &quot;Luck of the Irish&quot; and &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;. In 2000, <a href="/wiki/David_Shayler" title="David Shayler">David Shayler</a>, a former member of Britain&apos;s domestic security service MI5, suggested that Lennon had given money to the IRA, though this was swiftly denied by Ono. Biographer Bill Harry records that following Bloody Sunday, Lennon and Ono financially supported the production of the film <i>The Irish Tapes</i>, a political documentary with a <a href="/wiki/Irish_republicanism" title="Irish republicanism">Republican</a> slant.</p><p>According to FBI surveillance reports (and confirmed by <a href="/wiki/Tariq_Ali" title="Tariq Ali">Tariq Ali</a> in 2006) Lennon was sympathetic to the <a href="/wiki/International_Marxist_Group" title="International Marxist Group">International Marxist Group</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Trotskyist" class="mw-redirect" title="Trotskyist">Trotskyist</a> group formed in Britain in 1968. However, the FBI considered Lennon to have limited effectiveness as a revolutionary since he was &quot;constantly under the influence of narcotics&quot;.</p><p>In 1973, Lennon contributed a limerick called &quot;Why Make It Sad To Be Gay?&quot; to Len Richmond&apos;s <i>The Gay Liberation Book</i>.</p><p>Lennon&apos;s last act of political activism was a statement in support of the striking minority sanitation workers in San Francisco on 5 December 1980. He and Ono planned to join the workers&apos; protest on 14 December. By this time, however, Lennon had also quietly renounced the counterculture views which he had helped promote during the 1960s and 1970s and became more aligned with <a href="/wiki/Conservatism" title="Conservatism">conservatism</a>, though whether he had actually aligned to a more conservative world view is disputed.</p><p>Following the impact of &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; and &quot;<a href="/wiki/Happy_Xmas_(War_Is_Over)" title="Happy Xmas (War Is Over)">Happy Xmas (War Is Over)</a>&quot;, both strongly associated with the anti&#x2013;Vietnam War movement, the Nixon administration, hearing rumours of Lennon&apos;s involvement in a concert to be held in San Diego at the same time as the <a href="/wiki/Republican_National_Convention" title="Republican National Convention">Republican National Convention</a>, tried to have him deported. Nixon believed that Lennon&apos;s anti-war activities could cost him his re-election; Republican Senator <a href="/wiki/Strom_Thurmond" title="Strom Thurmond">Strom Thurmond</a> suggested in a February 1972 memo that &quot;deportation would be a strategic counter-measure&quot; against Lennon. The next month the United States <a href="/wiki/Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service" title="Immigration and Naturalization Service">Immigration and Naturalization Service</a> (INS) began deportation proceedings, arguing that his 1968 misdemeanor conviction for cannabis possession in London had made him ineligible for admission to the United States. Lennon spent the next three and a half years in and out of deportation hearings until 8 October 1975, when a court of appeals barred the deportation attempt, stating &quot;...&#xA0;the courts will not condone selective deportation based upon secret political grounds.&quot; While the legal battle continued, Lennon attended rallies and made television appearances. Lennon and Ono co-hosted <i><a href="/wiki/The_Mike_Douglas_Show" title="The Mike Douglas Show">The Mike Douglas Show</a></i> for a week in February 1972, introducing guests such as <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Rubin" title="Jerry Rubin">Jerry Rubin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bobby_Seale" title="Bobby Seale">Bobby Seale</a> to mid-America. In 1972, <a href="/wiki/Bob_Dylan" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> wrote a letter to the INS defending Lennon, stating:</p><p>John and Yoko add a great voice and drive to the country&apos;s so-called art institution. They inspire and transcend and stimulate and by doing so, only help others to see pure light and in doing that, put an end to this dull taste of petty commercialism which is being passed off as Artist Art by the overpowering mass media. Hurray for John and Yoko. Let them stay and live here and breathe. The country&apos;s got plenty of room and space. Let John and Yoko stay!</p><p>On 23 March 1973, Lennon was ordered to leave the US within 60 days. Ono, meanwhile, was granted permanent residence. In response, Lennon and Ono held a press conference on 1 April 1973 at the <a href="/wiki/New_York_City_Bar_Association" title="New York City Bar Association">New York City Bar Association</a>, where they announced the formation of the state of <a href="/wiki/Nutopia" title="Nutopia">Nutopia</a>; a place with &quot;no land, no boundaries, no passports, only people&quot;. Waving the white flag of Nutopia (two handkerchiefs), they asked for political asylum in the US. The press conference was filmed, and would later appear in the 2006 documentary <i><a href="/wiki/The_US_vs._John_Lennon" class="mw-redirect" title="The US vs. John Lennon">The US vs. John Lennon</a></i>. Lennon&apos;s <i><a href="/wiki/Mind_Games_(John_Lennon_album)" title="Mind Games (John Lennon album)">Mind Games</a></i> (1973) included the track &quot;Nutopian International Anthem&quot;, which comprised three seconds of silence. Soon after the press conference, Nixon&apos;s involvement in a political scandal came to light, and in June the <a href="/wiki/Watergate_scandal" title="Watergate scandal">Watergate</a> hearings began in Washington, DC. They led to the president&apos;s resignation 14 months later. Nixon&apos;s successor, <a href="/wiki/Gerald_Ford" title="Gerald Ford">Gerald Ford</a>, showed little interest in continuing the battle against Lennon, and the deportation order was overturned in 1975. The following year, his US immigration status finally resolved, Lennon received his <a href="/wiki/United_States_Permanent_Resident_Card" class="mw-redirect" title="United States Permanent Resident Card">&quot;green card&quot;</a> certifying his <a href="/wiki/Permanent_residency" title="Permanent residency">permanent residency</a>, and when <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Carter" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> was inaugurated as president in January 1977, Lennon and Ono attended the Inaugural Ball.</p><p>After Lennon&apos;s death, historian <a href="/wiki/Jon_Wiener" title="Jon Wiener">Jon Wiener</a> filed a <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)" title="Freedom of Information Act (United States)">Freedom of Information Act</a> request for <a href="/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">FBI</a> files documenting the Bureau&apos;s role in the deportation attempt. The FBI admitted it had 281 pages of files on Lennon, but refused to release most of them on the grounds that they contained national security information. In 1983, Wiener sued the FBI with the help of the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union" title="American Civil Liberties Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a> of <a href="/wiki/Southern_California" title="Southern California">Southern California</a>. It took 14 years of litigation to force the FBI to release the withheld pages. The ACLU, representing Wiener, won a favourable decision in their suit against the FBI in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit" title="United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit">Ninth Circuit</a> in 1991. The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice" title="United States Department of Justice">Justice Department</a> appealed the decision to the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court</a> in April 1992, but the court declined to review the case. In 1997, respecting President <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>&apos;s newly instigated rule that documents should be withheld only if releasing them would involve &quot;foreseeable harm&quot;, the Justice Department settled most of the outstanding issues outside court by releasing all but 10 of the contested documents.</p><p>Wiener published the results of his 14-year campaign in January 2000. <i>Gimme Some Truth: The John Lennon FBI Files</i> contained facsimiles of the documents, including &quot;lengthy reports by confidential informants detailing the daily lives of anti-war activists, memos to the White House, transcripts of TV shows on which Lennon appeared, and a proposal that Lennon be arrested by local police on drug charges&quot;. The story is told in the documentary <i>The US vs. John Lennon</i>. The final 10 documents in Lennon&apos;s FBI file, which reported on his ties with London anti-war activists in 1971 and had been withheld as containing &quot;national security information provided by a foreign government under an explicit promise of confidentiality&quot;, were released in December 2006. They contained no indication that the British government had regarded Lennon as a serious threat; one example of the released material was a report that two prominent British leftists had hoped Lennon would finance a left-wing bookshop and reading room.</p><p>Beatles biographer Bill Harry writes that Lennon began drawing and writing creatively at an early age with the encouragement of his uncle. He collected his stories, poetry, cartoons and caricatures in a Quarry Bank High School exercise book that he called the <i>Daily Howl</i>. The drawings were often of crippled people, and the writings satirical, and throughout the book was an abundance of wordplay. According to classmate Bill Turner, Lennon created the <i>Daily Howl</i> to amuse his best friend and later Quarrymen bandmate <a href="/wiki/Pete_Shotton" class="mw-redirect" title="Pete Shotton">Pete Shotton</a>, to whom he would show his work before he let anyone else see it. Turner said that Lennon &quot;had an obsession for <a href="/wiki/Wigan_Pier" title="Wigan Pier">Wigan Pier</a>. It kept cropping up&quot;, and in Lennon&apos;s story <i>A Carrot in a Potato Mine</i>, &quot;the mine was at the end of Wigan Pier.&quot; Turner described how one of Lennon&apos;s cartoons depicted a bus stop sign annotated with the question, &quot;Why?&quot;. Above was a flying pancake, and below, &quot;a blind man wearing glasses leading along a blind dog&#x2014;also wearing glasses&quot;.</p><p>Lennon&apos;s love of wordplay and nonsense with a twist found a wider audience when he was 24. Harry writes that <i><a href="/wiki/In_His_Own_Write" title="In His Own Write">In His Own Write</a></i> (1964) was published after &quot;Some journalist who was hanging around the Beatles came to me and I ended up showing him the stuff. They said, &apos;Write a book&apos; and that&apos;s how the first one came about&quot;. Like the <i>Daily Howl</i> it contained a mix of formats including short stories, poetry, plays and drawings. One story, &quot;Good Dog Nigel&quot;, tells the tale of &quot;a happy dog, <a href="/wiki/Raised-leg_urination" class="mw-redirect" title="Raised-leg urination">urinating on a lamp post</a>, barking, wagging his tail&#x2014;until he suddenly hears a message that he will be killed at three o&apos;clock&quot;. <i><a href="/wiki/The_Times_Literary_Supplement" title="The Times Literary Supplement">The Times Literary Supplement</a></i> considered the poems and stories &quot;remarkable&#xA0;... also very funny&#xA0;... the nonsense runs on, words and images prompting one another in a chain of pure fantasy&quot;. <i>Book Week</i> reported, &quot;This is nonsense writing, but one has only to review the <a href="/wiki/Literary_nonsense" title="Literary nonsense">literature of nonsense</a> to see how well Lennon has brought it off. While some of his homonyms are gratuitous word play, many others have not only double meaning but a double edge.&quot; Lennon was not only surprised by the positive reception, but that the book was reviewed at all, and suggested that readers &quot;took the book more seriously than I did myself. It just began as a laugh for me&quot;.</p><p>In combination with <i><a href="/wiki/A_Spaniard_in_the_Works" title="A Spaniard in the Works">A Spaniard in the Works</a></i> (1965), <i>In His Own Write</i> formed the basis of the stage play <i>The John Lennon Play: In His Own Write</i>, co-adapted by <a href="/wiki/Victor_Spinetti" title="Victor Spinetti">Victor Spinetti</a> and <a href="/wiki/Adrienne_Kennedy" title="Adrienne Kennedy">Adrienne Kennedy</a>. After negotiations between Lennon, Spinetti and the artistic director of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_National_Theatre" title="Royal National Theatre">National Theatre</a>, <a href="/wiki/Laurence_Olivier" title="Laurence Olivier">Sir Laurence Olivier</a>, the play opened at <a href="/wiki/The_Old_Vic" title="The Old Vic">The Old Vic</a> in 1968. Lennon and Ono attended the opening night performance, their second public appearance together. In 1969, Lennon wrote &quot;Four in Hand&quot;&#x200D;&#x2014;&#x200C;a skit based on his teenaged experiences of <a href="/wiki/Circle_jerk_(sexual_practice)" title="Circle jerk (sexual practice)">group masturbation</a>&#x200D;&#x2014;&#x200C;for <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Tynan" title="Kenneth Tynan">Kenneth Tynan</a>&apos;s play <i><a href="/wiki/Oh!_Calcutta!" title="Oh! Calcutta!">Oh! Calcutta!</a></i>. After Lennon&apos;s death, further works were published, including <i><a href="/wiki/Skywriting_by_Word_of_Mouth" title="Skywriting by Word of Mouth">Skywriting by Word of Mouth</a></i> (1986); <i>Ai: Japan Through John Lennon&apos;s Eyes: A Personal Sketchbook</i> (1992), with Lennon&apos;s illustrations of the definitions of Japanese words; and <i>Real Love: The Drawings for Sean</i> (1999). <i><a href="/wiki/The_Beatles_Anthology" title="The Beatles Anthology">The Beatles Anthology</a></i> (2000) also presented examples of his writings and drawings.</p><p>Lennon&apos;s playing of a mouth organ during a bus journey to visit his cousin in Scotland caught the driver&apos;s ear. Impressed, the driver told Lennon of a harmonica he could have if he came to Edinburgh the following day, where one had been stored in the bus depot since a passenger left it on a bus. The professional instrument quickly replaced Lennon&apos;s toy. He would continue to play harmonica, often using the instrument during the Beatles&apos; Hamburg years, and it became a signature sound in the group&apos;s early recordings. His mother taught him how to play the banjo, later buying him an acoustic guitar. At 16, he played rhythm guitar with the Quarrymen.</p><p>As his career progressed, he played a variety of electric guitars, predominantly the <a href="/wiki/Rickenbacker_325" title="Rickenbacker 325">Rickenbacker 325</a>, <a href="/wiki/Epiphone_Casino" title="Epiphone Casino">Epiphone Casino</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gibson_J-160E" title="Gibson J-160E">Gibson J-160E</a>, and, from the start of his solo career, the <a href="/wiki/Gibson_Les_Paul_Junior" title="Gibson Les Paul Junior">Gibson Les Paul Junior</a>. <i><a href="/wiki/Double_Fantasy" title="Double Fantasy">Double Fantasy</a></i> producer Jack Douglas claimed that since his Beatle days Lennon habitually tuned his D-string slightly flat, so his Aunt Mimi could tell which guitar was his on recordings. Occasionally he played a six-string bass guitar, the <a href="/wiki/Fender_Bass_VI" title="Fender Bass VI">Fender Bass VI</a>, providing bass on some Beatles numbers (&quot;<a href="/wiki/Back_in_the_U.S.S.R." title="Back in the U.S.S.R.">Back in the U.S.S.R.</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="/wiki/The_Long_and_Winding_Road" title="The Long and Winding Road">The Long and Winding Road</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="/wiki/Helter_Skelter_(song)" title="Helter Skelter (song)">Helter Skelter&quot;</a>) that occupied McCartney with another instrument. His other instrument of choice was the piano, on which he composed many songs, including &quot;Imagine&quot;, described as his best-known solo work. His jamming on a piano with McCartney in 1963 led to the creation of the Beatles&apos; first US number one, &quot;<a href="/wiki/I_Want_to_Hold_Your_Hand" title="I Want to Hold Your Hand">I Want to Hold Your Hand</a>&quot;.
